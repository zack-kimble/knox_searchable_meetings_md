| 0:06:36| I am legal counsel for main event from Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| 511 Union Street, Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| from the law firm of Waller-Lanston, Deutsch & Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=406)|

| 0:06:54| Paul, you missed the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=416)|

| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| So the history is March 17, 2018, cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| 4-11, we received a remedial plan on September the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| It was the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Notice of administrative hearing was sent and received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| and a revised remedial plan and a $500 fine was received on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| October the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Questions, or do you want to tell us what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| or tell us where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Sure, I'd be happy to explain sort of what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| and where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| I think, first of all, my client sent their regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| We're deeply sorry that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| You know, we've been in this community now for, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| about two years or so, and we take the sale of alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| very, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| And I think they've been extremely disappointed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| you know, employees on the ground have not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| adhered to the policy that has been set forth by the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| But they now have everyone's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| including my office here in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| which is why they sent me here to plead before the board today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| to sort of, again, illustrate that we're deeply sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| We want to be a good, standing member of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| and to outline the steps that are taken to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| So, you know, in this situation, when we initially submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| our initial plan, one of the steps that we really placed emphasis on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| was that whenever an employee sees an under-21 ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| they're supposed to look at the date very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| and make sure that they don't make that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| But in this case, the employee actually checked the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| As a matter of fact, one of the cadets, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| recently had a birthday, and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| happy early birthday, but for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| she just didn't notice the right date and stop the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| And so, again, we're really deeply sorry that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| But here are a couple of things that we've been doing since this sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| that we believe will prevent any future sale of alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| One is that we are still maintaining our zero-tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| for sale of alcohol to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Any server that sells is immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| There's no ifs or buts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Another thing that we're now doing is before we were carding, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| only patrons that are over or under the age of 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| Now we're carding everyone that comes to the door and orders alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Next thing we're doing is red box ID carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| And our office in Nashville, we've sort of been preaching this new method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| to a lot of our clients across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and we think it's going to be very, very relevant here in Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| And we've actually seen it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| And so an under-21 ID in Tennessee has got a red box on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| and the date that the person turns 21 is written on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| So there's no math involved at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| And in this situation, the employee saw the ID, saw the red card, saw the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| but for some reason, personal mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| she just didn't quite understand that she shouldn't have made that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| And so an additional step that we've now trained the staff on the ground on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| is that whenever a server sees an under-21 ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| that server is to call a manager over so that the manager gets to double-check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| what the date is on there and determine whether or not the person is over the age of 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| for the sale of alcohol purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| And so we've actually seen this working very well on the store on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| A lot of our servers are starting to comply to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| because they know that not only would their noncompliance yield to their arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| but that also means that they're jeopardizing the jobs that their team members have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| And so we think that with this additional step of having a manager check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| just to make sure to confirm the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| that that's going to reduce the human error that could potentially come with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| not appropriately looking at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Another step we're taking is to make sure that we're reminding our team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| on a daily basis of the born-on-date that they ought to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and also reminding them of our zero-tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| and to make sure that they're being adequately reminded that it is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| to not sell alcohol not only to minors but also intoxicated persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Another thing that we're doing is we've now posted signs all across the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| that again shows our servers what an under-21 ID in Tennessee looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| and making sure that we're beating that message in again on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| that they ought to make sure that they're not selling alcohol to folks that are under-21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| We've also scheduled a training to retrain all of our team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| not only on this policy but also on the company's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Again, we believe that this is going to help reinforce what we're already doing on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Moreover, is that we've increased our internal program that we have through bars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=747)|
| 0:12:35| and we actually haven't filled any bars things at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| and that's been going on at the store level since we got the first citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| Again, we believe that with all the steps that we've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| we're going to be able to avoid any sale of alcohol to minor at this establishment moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| Main Event wants to be a good member and good standing of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| We have about 150 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| It's a large facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| We make a lot of sales and we're pleading for this board to give us some leniency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| and that with these new steps that we have, we can continue to be a good member of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| and making sure that, again, we're not selling alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| And so we're just really asking for the board to give us some leniency at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Are there multiple points of sale inside Main Event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| There are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| And Sergeant Cowher, was there more than one sale in the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| On September 29th, yes, I had two cadets with me and the server in question sold to both cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| Was it the same server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| So one and then another, right back to back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| The first violation, I believe, was March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| But the two sales in the same night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| They were at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| At the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| So it had to be two different servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| No, it was the same server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Same server sold to two different people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Both of them underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| But I just want to clarify that it was the same transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and also the server issue at that specific day, from what I'm hearing from the team on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| that she was not feeling too good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And that may have been part of the reason why that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| but there was an absent mind there, which we're, again, really sorry for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| But I think the policy of making sure that the manager checks whenever there's a red box on an ID card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| is going to help limit some of those errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| That's what I was going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| because part of your remedial plan here was to add a second layer of checks with the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| Now, is the manager checking each sale from each location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| And how many managers would you have on duty that would be doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| So at any point in time, we usually have a manager that's on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And we have actually multiple that are on duty because it's a big facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| And so the plan is that whenever a server sees one that's got an ID on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| call the manager over so that the manager can verify that one on date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| to make sure that that person is indeed over 21 before we make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| This only applies to ID cards that have that red box on it that are easily identifiable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| where you can say, okay, for sure this person is under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| And also, I mean, there are people, of course, coming with multiple IDs from different states as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| Part of what we're still, again, doing is making sure we're reinforcing that one on date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| so that whenever we have a policy, whenever a server is in doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| again, call the manager over and have the manager verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Okay. And Mr. Frost, I was just going to ask you, what are our options here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| In this circumstance, you have the option of accepting what they presented, their remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| and that could be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| The other option is to refer them to the hearing officer for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| They are presently a noncompliance complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| It was filed by the law department recently because they did not submit their remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| and they're fine in time, so they're already going to the hearing officer for that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| But this is a totally different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| You all do have discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| And if I may, on the noncompliance stuff, I'm happy to answer any questions about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| if members of the board have any questions about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| But, again, we're deeply sorry about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| There are some technical issues that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| My firm has been working with this board for the last six years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and we've taken clients through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| But this is the first time this has ever happened, and incredibly sorry that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| But I'm also happy to answer any questions that anyone has about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Follow up on the question about the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| I do not know what the laws are in other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| but I'm assuming that periodically you get driver's licenses from out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| and they may or may not have that red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| What's the procedure to make sure you don't sell to under 21 from out of state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| Excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you for asking that question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| What we're doing, again, is the red box ID card is one piece of our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| to make sure that our servers are not selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| But I think if we look at our other plans, making sure that we have signs posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| that specifically states the born-on date all across the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| so that servers are constantly being reminded of the born-on date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| We're having daily meetings with our team members to make sure we're reinforcing that message again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| that this is the date that you ought to be looking at on ID cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| And whenever you're in doubt, please make sure you call a manager over to double-check for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| And I think another factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| All right, thanks for mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| So we also have an ID, and this is part of our returning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| We've got an ID book for every single state here in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| so that our servers can look at them and be very familiar with what IDs from other states look at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| And we think that's also going to help reduce some of the human errors that typically happens in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| And another fact that really caused this person to make the sale at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| was that it was a busier time than what main event typically looks like during the weekday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| And so that may have also been a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| But we believe that with all these plans that we can use that as a means of reminding folks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| And we work with clients, like I said before, on this issue all across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| And a lot of times what we just end up seeing is that there's just a human error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| where someone is not really paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| And so part of what all the remedial plans that we've put in place is to catch that from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Okay, so these were made at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| 1,500, is that what I'm seeing on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| 9, 29, 18, 1,500 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| So I want you to understand that he had one citation in March of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| He cited, but there was actually two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| There's two citations offered on the same date, on the same server, at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| I mean, our options are we can accept what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| That was the same transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| There was actually four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Two were adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| One was Sergeant Coutt and another adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And so it was the same table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| It was three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| It was myself and two cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| So that was one transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| It was one transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| However, it was not an overwhelmingly busy time, as counsel has tried to lead you to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1235)|
| 0:20:44| The mistake that was made was the waitress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| I watched her try to do the math in her head to figure out the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| Howard, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And just so that the board knows, I think the decision I was trying to draw is that it was a much busier time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| per the management on the ground, that it was a much busier time than they typically would have during the weekdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| when the server is on a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| A question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Does the main event have a register system where they would have to input the date of birth of a person before they are able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1282)|
| 0:21:32| So they do not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| That's certainly an option, and we're open to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| But what we found in our practice across the board is that for a lot of disestablishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| being able to expedite the sale process is sort of a priority to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| But, you know, we think that with all the steps, again, making sure that we have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| because it's quite possible that you could have that system in place and someone keys in the wrong date, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And so, again, it's about catching that human error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| and making sure that we limit the impact that that could have on a transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| We've seen that where there are businesses that do have that system in place and there's a keying error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I think what's a little alarming is that you guys have had this amount in such a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| and so there's definitely more human error than really should be allowable at this particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| It looks like you've had some – the remediation plan that you had in place previously with the trainings should have been sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| However, you still have employees that are continuously making these errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and if you have an employee that has to stand there and try to do the math, that's obviously not working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| How many servers, bartenders, and managers do you have that would have to go through training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| We have 35 total servers and bartenders, and we have nine managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| And when is your retraining scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| We are setting that up with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| We already had one the last time, and this server was actually – she was present for that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| and we're now setting a new one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| And also, just so you all know, what's going to happen is that the ABC is probably also going to cite us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| and as part of that process, the ABC offers an ID training class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| and all of the servers and managers will be required to go through that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And so the fact that you've already had the training, the first training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| this particular server was in the training and still failed to be able to do the math, I think that's very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| And so has your company considered getting the register system that will do the math for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I will take that option to them for sure, and I thank you for suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| I'll definitely mention that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| But I think that, again, with the red box and part of what we're trying to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| the message that we're trying to get out to some of our clients and servers across Tennessee is that with a red box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| there's not even any math involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| The date is already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| The born on date that the person turns 21 is already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| It's just a matter of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| But not all the licenses you'll be looking at have the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| But most of our patrons that we get across the door typically have Tennessee IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| Well, I think the concern you're hearing is regarding the close time and proximity to these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| the fact that two of them occurred at the same time at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| And I think that what Councilperson McKenzie was talking about with keying in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| that was something I was going to follow up on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Having a system where you could do that I think would make everyone a little bit more comfortable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| The other thing would be that what I was gathering from your previous statement was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| a manager's not checking every time an ID comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| It's only when something's being flagged and saying, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| So given the proximity of these citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| do you think it would be a good idea to have a manager check each of these transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| or to have a system like Councilperson McKenzie was suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Yeah, I think those are two excellent suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| and I'm going to take them back to my client as something that they should consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| per the board's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| So one thing I thought about with that is maybe we could postpone until the next beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| to give them time to put together a new remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| and they can maybe come back with that system in their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| That would be an option, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| But I believe there's presently scheduled a hearing for them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| I don't know the feelings of the beer board if they're wanting to accept it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| go with your postponement, or send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| But if you postpone it and you don't like it, and then you go back to the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| they're going to be duplicating the expense of going through the hearing officer process, I think, twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| Has it been scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| It has been scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| The pre-conference hearing for this permittee is already scheduled for November 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| which is actually the same day as your next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| Yes, just for council's information, all 50 states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| the issued under 21 driver's licenses do have somewhere on there an under 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| until this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Generally, it is right beside the driver's picture, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| Some of them have gone to a vertically oriented under 21 license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| but all of them have something on there to where the servers do not have to do any sort of math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| to try to figure out if they are over or under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you, Chairman. Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| You know, ever since I've been on beer board, one of the most striking things is how many of the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| are people just not doing the math, because we get our columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| So it's a problem that we've seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I think in terms of the machine, I think that sounds good and it works great for checkout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| but I'm just sort of thinking how it works at a restaurant, that if you've got a server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| say you've got a table of four and everybody orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| then they've got to go back and then put those through a machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I think it can make things pretty clunky, especially if you're in some of these restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| where the server is pretty far away from where a cash register is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I don't know if there's any restaurant that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| There are some that they actually write down the customer's date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Okay. Yes, I think I've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And they go and input it into the system, because we have been turned away by folks doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| Okay. Yeah, I think that may be – did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Okay. Anyway, I just wanted to raise that point that sometimes logistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| that could get difficult at a big restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| So our options are to accept it like it is or to pass it on to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| Or you could postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| It would expedite it quicker for them to actually have another hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| I think I would recommend we send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Okay. Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| All those in favor of sending this on to a hearing officer, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1755)|

| 0:29:26| The person in the law department who will be filing the complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| she generally seeks some type of general guidance from the beer board in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBoardR293181023?start=1770)|
