| 2:12:43| between the church and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| And so that's the concern that I wanted to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| on behalf of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| express that we're concerned with what having blast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| and or new roads put in directly across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| from such an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| I would really do to our structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| I'm sorry to interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| but would you point out where your church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| is on the map we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| Yes, I'm on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| I might need Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Can you point to it by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| I don't have the screen sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| We can point to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| We can have Karen on our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| I've actually got it pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| This is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| If I can share my screen real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8005)|
| 2:13:39| Okay, can you see my screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Okay, this location here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| is the Asbury United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| And then this location here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| is the Cruise Farm Ice Cream House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8032)|
| 2:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Okay, I'm gonna stop sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| Mr. Farrell, would you like to comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| This is Jeff Farrell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| with Blue Water Industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| East Tennessee General Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| I live at 2601 Cherokee Road in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| And I would just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| pursuant to the church's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| adding this land to the quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| will not change our operational structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| We are bound by permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| that all traffic will enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| and exit off of John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| And there's no intention to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| Thank you, Mr. Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| Mr. Mullins, do you have a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| You got about two minutes and 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| Just briefly, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| and appreciate the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| I mean, the thing with quarrying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| you know, you have to look at a quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| where the minerals are found in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| It's hard to plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| But this area has historically been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| with this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| And, you know, it's completely consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| with the surrounding sector plans and zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| And if there is any change in the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| that's going to have to come back through this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| with approval of a plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| And we would be in contact with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| and with the church and Pastor Hilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| and making sure we are listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| and addressing any of the concerns they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| I mean, this is simply really just making the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| filling in the gaps of the existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| and making it consistent with the rest of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| that's already existing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| So with that, again, I would urge approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| Yeah, I was just going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| just so I understand right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| the sector plan is for mining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| light industrial, general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| ag and general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| And what they're wanting to change to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| is light industrial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| And is this just to clean up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| I mean, is there a major change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| that's going to happen on these properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| Or, I mean, you're going to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| the mining sector plan from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| So, I mean, the reason you're doing this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| and forgive me if I've missed something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| but what is the reason that we're doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| The ag zone allows for mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| So that's, you know, is it necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| by itself for what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| The commercial zone and commercial sector plan does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| That's the only one that really needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Staff, I believe, did recommend changing it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| to light industrial instead of the HIM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| to have a less intensive sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| It doesn't affect the ability to do mining in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| I'm not exactly sure why that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| except I believe the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| for HIM requires it to be closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| to interstate interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| than the existing HIM sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| So it may be cleaning it up on their end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| This is really just trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| the existing zones consistent with what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| The only necessary change is the commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| which would not allow for the quarrying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| That's only a very small portion of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| I see other people want to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| so I'm not going to make a motion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| but I understand, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| Thank you, Chairman Pelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| I'm going to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| a lot of industrial per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| Scott Smith, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| All right, before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Chair will recognize Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Yes, I had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| One of the concerns expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| by the religious institution across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| had to do with blasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| and would you address whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| that would be a concern for that church building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| which is historic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| I don't believe it would be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| I mean, there's a potential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| There's blasting occasionally at the existing quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| and if that were to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| there would have to be a plan of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| that would take into account any additional blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| However, blasting is regulated by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| It is extremely regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| and intended to mitigate from any concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| in any areas for residential that may be nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| So it's something that would be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| at a future date with any plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| What we're doing now at this rezoning stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| wouldn't really affect the potential for blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Well, can you guarantee that the blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| won't affect the church building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| I guarantee that if we meet all the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| we're required to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| it would not affect the church building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| and that's what we're bound to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| You know, I can't say that a mistake would never be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| No one could ever say something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| but we're in an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| We would have to meet all the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| and I think Blue Water and its predecessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| have shown a history of being good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| and being able to meet their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| I recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| Thank you, and I echo some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| that Commissioner Corbett brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| I'm not in opposition to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| but I will say for the record that I did grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| not at Asbury United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| but at Eastwood, which is pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| just across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| and in the lower part of that yellow section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| So I do have just the overall concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| about just the blasting in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| as it is getting closer to what I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| are some neighborhood homes that live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| some people, as well as just the two churches in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| one being the historic church of Asbury United Methodist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| But again, as Mr. Mullin said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| as long as they do everything right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| we will have continuous opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| to look at this as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| So I'm not in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| Just some concerns that will stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| on the forefront of my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8458)|

| 2:23:34| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8614)|

| 2:23:38| 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| I don't see any opposition so Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| you're free to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8626)|

| 2:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8629)|
| 2:23:49| We're actually going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| I was just on this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| and the next agenda item yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| On this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| I understand staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| to deny the requested RN5 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| is because the sector plan that's present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| for middle medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| does not allow for RN5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| and that would require a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| and a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| and I agree with staff's analysis on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| That was a change that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| fairly recently in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| and the RN5 used to be a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| that was allowed medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| and it was then changed and taken out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| So we're asking for a 60-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| to put this on the January's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| so we can revise our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| to include the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| and a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| That would make this application ripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| for consideration for the RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| It would have to be postponed until January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| because the bylaws of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| only consider one-year plan amendments every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| and the next consideration is the January agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| Okay, so you're requesting a 60-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8709)|

| 2:26:26| I'm actually going to ask that one be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| Applicant is Ronnie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| Property located north side of Greenway Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| east side of Broadway, north of I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| Applicant is seeking rezoning from office to highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| Staff recommends rezoning the property to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| This application require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Mr. Mullins, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8817)|
| 2:26:57| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| I did send an email out late yesterday afternoon to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| I sent it to the commission at knoxplanning.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| And copied Ms. Portier and Ms. Brooks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| I hope everyone's had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| I understand staff is recommending a denial of our request for a prior zoning equivalent to CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8835)|
| 2:27:23| And the basis for that denial is that there is no other CH1 zoning in that near vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8843)|
| 2:27:31| And that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| The prior zone, however, was a C4 zone, which is the equivalent of the CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8853)|
| 2:27:42| If you look at the prior zone's general description and the zoning ordinance that was in effect in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8862)|
| 2:27:51| the general description of the C4 highway and arterial commercial district zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| is that this highway and arterial commercial district is established to provide areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| in which the principal use of land is devoted to commercial establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| which cater specifically to the needs of motor vehicle oriented trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| You compare that to the purpose statement in Article 5.1 of the current zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8890)|
| 2:28:18| 5.1.3, the CH highway commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| And it is almost identical in its description of the general purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| One of the uses identified by the staff is vehicle storage and there's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| vehicle sales that occur on that property and occurred prior to the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8913)|
| 2:28:42| That use would not be allowed in staff's recommended CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| It is only a permitted use in the CH zones and the higher commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| If you also would compare the prior zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| the staff's point that this property would be the only property that has a CH zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8937)|
| 2:29:04| in the immediate vicinity, the rest of it being CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| that is consistent with what was there before the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| The C4 zone in that area was the only C4 zone in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| The other commercial zones were C3 and C2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| So that constitution of zones was what was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8962)|
| 2:29:32| And this again is a request for a prior equivalent zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| The only prior equivalent zone would be CH1 for what was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| If this is not granted, then the existing automobile use there would be relegated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| to a non-conforming use which has a detrimental effect on the property's value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| So we're asking that the purpose of the prior equivalent zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| within one year of the adoption of the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| was to make sure we didn't inadvertently remove any rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| that people had under the old zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| since it was such a sweeping and wholesale change of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| This is one where it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| Even with staff's recommendation to change this from office to CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| it still wouldn't address the rights that would be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| So I respect staff's analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| I usually agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| In this case, I think the CH1 is the only zone that we could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| that would meet the intent of the transitional rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| of the existing zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| and to give the applicant what he had by way of zoning before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| I would like to recognize Ms. Borchetti and Director Brooke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| So just to kind of touch on some of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| that Mr. Mullins was mentioning earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| So he is correct that the use that's there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| would have been allowed in the C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| And because it was legal conforming at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| it would be legal conforming now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| So it would be allowed to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| He just wouldn't be able to expand operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| expand the footprint of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| but it would be allowed to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| You know, this is kind of one of those tricky areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| that we rezoned a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| when we were looking at the zoning maps and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| and trying to bring properties into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| make the areas more cohesive and more in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| And I would argue that part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| behind the comparable zone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| is to allow someone the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| to make their argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| but it doesn't necessarily guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| that that zone would be allowed to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| It's just a request like any other rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| that we get and heard the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| And so for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9114)|
| 2:31:54| I would argue that the CH zone wouldn't be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| because it's much more intense than the CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| and it would be out of character for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| It's the only CH zoning that would be in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| And it's also at the gateway into a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| And so I feel like CH zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| is even more inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| because it's right there next to residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9137)|
| 2:32:28| I think Ms. Portia did a great job of covering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| I just wanted to reiterate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| you know, that purpose of that equivalent zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| was to give people a no fee opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| to make their requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| So it still requires analysis by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| and by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| Chair recognizes Commissioner Corobolic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| Yeah, I have a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| My comment is that the site itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| I believe is inappropriate for the CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| It's not easily accessible from the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| from the interstate while it's visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| It's what you might sort of call a statute of liberty property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| in that you can see it, but it's difficult to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| And it's very difficult to get away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| to get back onto the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| I'm not sure that the site itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| is appropriate for the CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| My question is the reference to vehicle sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| gone through the historic aerials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| I don't see that vehicle sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| is the existing use on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| I just wanted to confirm that I heard staff correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| that if this is approved as just CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9231)|
| 2:33:58| excuse me, as the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| now I've forgotten the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| but as opposed to CH4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| that it would be legal non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| So nothing, the person could continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| but it would be legal non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| The way that it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| any use that was legally conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| with the zoning at the time of the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| will have to continue operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| Okay, thanks for confirming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Robb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| You know, I struggle with this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| and I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| like regardless of what our motivation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| we took this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| rezoned it without the owner's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| and arguably reduced the value of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| And I think changing it to a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| that doesn't allow what's happening there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| really, I just don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| I think we should change it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| to something comparable to what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| Okay, we're discussing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| I just want to make sure I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| because this is a very visible piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| It's elevated, it's got topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| but I'm also sensitive to what Jeff was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| I don't want to take something from somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| that they had previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| but has the sector plan been the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| throughout this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| or has it changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| You said that it was a C4 before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| Was the sector plan accommodating to that zone prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| The sector plan is GC, General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| so it allows both CB and CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| We just didn't recommend the CH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| because even though it was compliant with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| we just felt like it was out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| with the area and too intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| for the residential uses beyond it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| But it is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| Commissioner Aston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| I don't really think the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| the highway commercial is appropriate for this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| especially with it next to the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| It is accessed not off of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| but from the side street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| I do appreciate that the current owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| can continue to operate his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| as he has been and as he currently is operating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| So that helps you make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| that I think the staff has is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| Chair, we'll obtain a motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| I can make a motion to approve the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| for a rezone to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9419)|

| 2:38:44| Motion does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9529)|

| 2:38:53| I can make a motion that we approve CH1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| highway commercial, as it puts it back to a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9548)|

| 2:39:23| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| Yes, and I'd like to just add a quick asterisk that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| because it meets the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| if this was a spot zoning that didn't get covered before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| in a sector plan, I'd have voted no as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| But because the sector plan provides for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| that's the reason for my yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9578)|

| 2:42:20| CHAIRMAN HICKS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| DEBORAH PETTIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9743)|
| 2:42:23| I'm Deborah Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| I live at 10451 Laurel Point Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9744)|
| 2:42:30| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| I am president of the Magnolia Point Homeowners Association and several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| and represent several subdivisions and homeowners on Coward Mill and Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| We are concerned with the five dwellings per acre that this developer is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9762)|
| 2:42:48| The development to the west of this property and another one further down Coward Mill to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| by the Veterans Home were limited to 3.5 per acre by previous planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9773)|
| 2:43:01| Your staff recommended that the five would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| but that is not appropriate to what has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9785)|
| 2:43:10| All of the surrounding subdivisions are 3.5 or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| and we want to continue with that precedent in our small community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| so we ask you to limit him to 3.5 dwelling units or less per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| Also, we would like the planning commission to tell the developer that no houses will be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| until the Cherahala extension and the widening of Coward Mill is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| The developer to the west was told he could only build about 38 houses until everything was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| completed. The infrastructure needs to be the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| The traffic and congestion that will be generated by the construction of these two projects will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| deeply impact our area without any additional construction, so we ask that you follow precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| and limit the developer in building any dwellings units until the infrastructure is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9835)|
| 2:44:02| Lastly, we wish you the commissioner would look at the value of current homes in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| The proposed houses to be built. Some developers come in and slap down the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| scrape the land of any vegetation, build track homes to squeeze on the lot, pack up, leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9854)|
| 2:44:22| just to do the same thing in another area. People want to move to Knoxville and Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| because of the beauty, but after creating these subdivisions, you are letting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| destroy the surrounding areas. What will these subdivisions look like in 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| When you are making these decisions, make decisions as if they were moving into your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| area. Please leave us some semblance of what our community was supposed to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9884)|
| 2:44:50| Thank you for your service and cooperation, and I would like to reserve the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9890)|
| 2:44:57| in case I need it at the end. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| Thank you, Miss Pettit. Mr. Hickey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| Yes, this is Ryan Hickey. 12612 Thistledown Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9904)|
| 2:45:13| We'd like to request approval per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| We feel that's appropriate based on the new improvements that are being done to Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| Road and the Cherahead Boulevard extension. It's my understanding that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9925)|
| 2:45:35| Schools has a plan to improve both of those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| There is also several discussion items about Phase 2 of Cherahead Boulevard coming through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| this property, and we have discussed with Knox County Engineering about this, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| preliminary plans that show that, and we have an engineer working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9952)|
| 2:45:59| so that what we propose aligns with what Knox County Engineering wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9959)|
| 2:46:06| So, I'd just like to keep the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| Thank you. Miss Albertson, can you fill us in on how staff came up with five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9970)|
| 2:46:20| versus the 3.5 that was mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. So, you know, we really went back and forth on this a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9985)|
| 2:46:36| but we felt that given the amount of improvements and investments in the infrastructure that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=9996)|
| 2:46:42| going into this area, that up to five dwelling units an acre is warranted at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10002)|
| 2:46:50| particularly because a new school is coming next door, and this will be within the parental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10010)|
| 2:46:57| responsibility zone for that school. So, having a neighborhood that's adjacent to a school that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10017)|
| 2:47:04| walkable, you know, sidewalks would likely be required at the use on review stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10024)|
| 2:47:13| under planned residential moving forward, also because there are several road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| that have been mentioned that are supposed to be happening in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| You know, it's a challenge to think about where density should go, but I think next to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10044)|
| 2:47:35| is something that, you know, we have considered as being something warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10055)|
| 2:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| Yes, thank you. I have one question, and this is, there was some comment from the public about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10074)|
| 2:48:04| there being a safety concern about natural gas storage tanks close by. Does staff have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10084)|
| 2:48:13| record of this, this message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| This is Liz Albertson again. I am not aware of that. We could see if anyone with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10097)|
| 2:48:27| Engineering, since I know they've been working on engineering for the Terra Halla extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10107)|
| 2:48:32| in this area, if they're aware of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| About this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| Yeah, Liz, this is Jim Stone. Yes, there is a natural gas pipeline that runs to the south of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| this, or I guess the southwest of this location. It doesn't touch this property and is several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10128)|
| 2:48:54| hundred feet from it, but there is a natural gas pipeline in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| So it's known and it's far enough away and it's not a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10139)|
| 2:49:06| Huh. I wouldn't think so, Commissioner Adams. It's a pretty good distance away from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| so I wouldn't foresee any safety risk with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| The other thing, this is a comment, that it seems like the real import from neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10155)|
| 2:49:25| residents, et cetera, is around the density. It's not a complete don't develop, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10165)|
| 2:49:33| around the density recommendation, and that there were several messages about 3.5 being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10173)|
| 2:49:40| acceptable and also pointing to the development right next door being in that same zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10180)|
| 2:49:48| So I think that's an encouraging sign in terms of the public not just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| no, no development, but this is the factor that's important to us. I just wanted to raise that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10193)|
| 2:50:00| Thank you, Commissioner. I'm going to allow Ms. Pettit to comment. She still has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| two and a half minutes remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| Thank you. Yes, that propane area is very large. That abuts the property that is right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10207)|
| 2:50:19| They are above ground tanks, and I was shocked to see that how close the other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10219)|
| 2:50:26| planned their homes right next to that. So that's the first thing, yes. So it is not that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10226)|
| 2:50:35| I was even surprised they put a school that close, because if it goes, it's going to make a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10235)|
| 2:50:40| explosion. The second thing is, if we don't get the 3.5 that the precedent has been set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10240)|
| 2:50:48| you're opening a can of worms for other tracts of land that are around this area and on Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10248)|
| 2:50:59| And every single development that has gone in, Mr. Davis's, the big one right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10259)|
| 2:51:07| he agreed to the 3.5, and so did the commissioners. The ones down by the veterans home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| the new subdivisions going in, they have been at 3.5. The ones at the very end of Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10274)|
| 2:51:22| I think, are at 3.5 also. So I think that the precedent does say that it should be a 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10282)|
| 2:51:31| and I don't care how well that road is going to be improved. There's going to be a lot of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10291)|
| 2:51:39| on that road, a lot more than there is now. We have school buses that will be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| We have all of those 114 homes, I think, that are in Mr. Davis's, so that if you figure four cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10304)|
| 2:51:54| we'll just put easy numbers, 500 cars in and out of there. Even with this small tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| that's over 100, 125 cars per day that will be coming in and out of that. So I'll save the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10319)|
| 2:52:08| of my time if I have any, but I think 3.5 is more than enough to build the houses that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10328)|
| 2:52:16| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korpelik. Thank you. Yes, I have two questions. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10336)|
| 2:52:24| one is for Mr. Snowden. During preliminary agenda, you gave a complete answer to my question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10344)|
| 2:52:32| what the improvements would be, what the timing would be, and the relationship of those improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10352)|
| 2:52:38| and timing element of this property. Would you repeat that for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10358)|
| 2:52:45| Yes, I'll be happy to, Commissioner Korpelik. Yes, we do have two separate projects on this. I'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10365)|
| 2:52:52| with the Cherahala Extension Project, Phase 1, which goes from the current terminus of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| Cherahala Boulevard and extends north to Coward Mill Road. That project, we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| of acquiring right-of-way now. Our plan to start construction early spring and I think a six to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10386)|
| 2:53:14| nine month completion time frame, so that project will be complete by the end of calendar year 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| The Coward Mill Project involves the project or a widening of the entirety of Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| from the Ben Ashley Veterans Home to Pellissippi Parkway, including a new bridge over Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10407)|
| 2:53:36| which is off alignment. The rest of the road is on alignment. Essentially, we widen existing roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| in its current location, but the new bridge will be off alignment and actually go to the south of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10421)|
| 2:53:46| the current bridge several hundred feet to allow us to improve the vertical and horizontal alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| of those locations. That'll be two 10-foot lanes, two-foot shoulders, and a sidewalk on one side to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10431)|
| 2:53:59| allow for the pedestrian connectivity to the school. And we plan on completing that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10439)|
| 2:54:08| starting construction hopefully sometime late next year, and completing it by the time school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| opens, proposed to be open in fall of 2022, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10453)|
| 2:54:22| Good, thank you. And then my second question is to the applicant's agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| A planned residential is a appropriate zone when there is an environmental constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| I'd like you to identify your environmental constraint, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| I'm not sure if it's an environmental constraint, but the biggest constraint with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10476)|
| 2:54:47| is being able to put homes on it and also allowing Knox County to put phase two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| Chair Head Boulevard through it. So that's really the constraint with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10494)|
| 2:55:02| Mr. Snowden, does the phase two go through this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10502)|
| 2:55:07| Yes, Commissioner Corbett. It does. We have yet to decide. That alignment is still in a tentative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10507)|
| 2:55:17| fashion because that particular phase, phase two, which goes north of Coward Mill to Horseshoe Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10517)|
| 2:55:25| is being funded in part by the state of Tennessee. I have spoken with Ryan and we think that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10525)|
| 2:55:34| much to his comment, have a road alignment that runs through there that both works for him and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| works for us. So we're in a good spot to make some alignment changes to assist in his development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10540)|
| 2:55:47| as part of the timing of our project. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10547)|
| 2:55:57| Yes, I just wanted to point out a couple of things. I remember when this other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| went through rezoning at 3.5, there was a lot of confusion about access and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10562)|
| 2:56:09| this extension of Chair Head Boulevard kind of evolved through those discussions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| topography was that was a little more challenging property and I think that had a lot to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10574)|
| 2:56:20| having the three and a half units an acre. I think this property, as I look at topography maps on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10580)|
| 2:56:27| is one of the flattest properties I've seen. You know, on a 5.4 acre property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| you're talking about the difference between three and a half and five is like eight houses. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10593)|
| 2:56:38| rather give them the opportunity to do a design that would be no more than five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10598)|
| 2:56:44| They may end up at four, but it makes sense to utilize this density with the school being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| Really good road coming right in. So I'm gonna make a motion that we approve LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10609)|
| 2:56:55| Low Density Residential Designation, because it's consistent with the adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| All right, Commissioner Roth, you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| No, I was going to make the motion or second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10628)|
| 2:57:12| Already done. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Good. We've got a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Hutton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10633)|
| 2:57:19| to approve LDR, Low Density Residential Designation, first staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10639)|

| 2:58:12| I can support the 3.5, but the difference, no, my vote's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10692)|
| 2:58:19| This is a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| Would you still like to keep your vote no, Mr. Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10707)|

| 2:58:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10739)|

| 3:02:18| due north of Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| Applicant is seeking the East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| from low-density residential and general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10944)|
| 3:02:29| and rezoning from agricultural to general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| Staff recommendation is to deny the East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| to general commercial and denial of rezoning the property to general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| This application required two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=10961)|

| 3:03:22| I'm speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| We support staff recommendation to deny this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| The CA zone is an older legacy zone for those that aren't very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| It's a zone that really has, you know, pretty intensive uses allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11013)|
| 3:03:39| not a lot in terms of landscaping and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| and really is not appropriate to put in the middle of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| So we strongly support the recommendation to deny CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11033)|
| 3:03:59| Ms. Nelson, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11039)|
| 3:04:07| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11047)|
| 3:04:08| So chair will entertain comments from commission or a motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| I'd like to make a motion to support the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11053)|
| 3:04:18| to deny the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11058)|

| 3:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11069)|
| 3:04:30| So we have a motion by Commissioner Corbelic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11070)|
| 3:04:33| seconded by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| to deny amendment to the East County Sector Plan to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11075)|

| 3:04:47| Okay, I'm sorry, but I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| I think this lady paid $1,600 to make this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| and I know she should be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| but there's a chance that maybe she's just having trouble getting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| Has anybody heard from her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| I'm showing a phone number that might be her, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11103)|
| 3:05:10| Liz, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| I do not see this person on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| but we have communicated with them in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| So I was under the assumption that they were going to be on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| Commissioner Smith, would you be interested in postponing it for then for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| I really think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| I would make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| I'm not saying we should, but I just hate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| I mean, the lady paid $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| I hate if she's just having problems, but I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11144)|
| 3:05:45| I agree with you, and I am going to withdraw that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| if my second will agree to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| and motion to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| Commissioner Newton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| I'll be happy to amend my motion and follow Ms. Korbelick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| and make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11167)|
| 3:06:11| So we have a motion by Commissioner Korbelick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| second by Commissioner Newton to postpone this item for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11174)|

| 3:06:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| Could we just move this to the back of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11189)|
| 3:06:32| and try and contact the lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11192)|
| 3:06:38| rather than postpone it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11198)|
| 3:06:43| if we can take care of it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| and if she wants it taken care of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| And I agree that she paid a lot of money to have a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11208)|
| 3:06:54| but if she's having problems or we can't contact her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| that's one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11219)|
| 3:07:00| but I think we could just maybe move it to the back of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| and have someone try and contact her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| We've just got so many things to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| I'd just soon postpone it, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| Yeah, we're at number 24 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11233)|
| 3:07:17| We've got to get down to 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| and it is now 10 till 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| That doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| So we have a motion to postpone for 30 days in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11246)|

| 3:08:17| Applicant is Bill Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11297)|
| 3:08:20| Property located north side of Tekoi Quarry Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| east of Beaver Ridge Road and south of Shaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| Applicant is seeking rezoning from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| and hillside protection to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| Staff recommendation is approve rezoning the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| to low density residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| Mr. Johnson, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| Yes, sir, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| I see no others have signed up in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| So give me your name again, your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11339)|
| 3:08:59| My name is Bill Johnson and I live at 6609 Tekoi Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| which borders the 6521 Tekoi Quarry property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| that I just purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| And I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| When I bought it, there are three residences on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| three houses on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| There's a double wide trailer, a single wide trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| and a one bedroom stick built home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| all of which are in complete disrepair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| and need to be demolished and removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| And my plan was to remove all those from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| and allow my two daughters and their husbands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| to live on that property next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| But with its current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| there can be one residence per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| And I need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| I would like to have that changed to allow my daughters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11378)|
| 3:09:40| and my grandchildren to live next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11383)|
| 3:09:50| Commissioners, we retain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| This was pulled off consent by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| I have my hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11395)|
| 3:10:00| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11400)|
| 3:10:00| Thank you, Commissioner Corlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11402)|
| 3:10:08| May I go ahead and ask my question or are we waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11410)|
| 3:10:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| Mr. Johnson, thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| The question I have is actually for Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| if he is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| And that's because I drove out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11421)|
| 3:10:24| and that Teequay Quarry Road is basically a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11424)|
| 3:10:31| And I calculated that at this proposed density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11431)|
| 3:10:36| you could have a home at 10,000 square feet per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| And I was just concerned about the adequacy of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| I know we don't usually talk about that time of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| This road is just kind of sloppy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| And I was concerned about the capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11452)|
| 3:10:56| of handling any increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11456)|
| 3:11:02| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| I'm sorry, Ms. Corblake, my mic was muted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| Yeah, we measured it on our road file system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| And we come up with the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| from where it intersects with Beaver Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| back to pass where this gentleman's access would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11481)|
| 3:11:24| is 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| I noticed he's looking at doing one lot into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11487)|
| 3:11:31| Even if he was to further subdivide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| we're pretty comfortable with the 18 foot wide being adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| For the proposed use at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11498)|
| 3:11:47| Thank you, so the asphalt is 18 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| or the right of way is 18 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| The asphalt, Commissioner Corblake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| I didn't look at the right of way specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| but the asphalt looked like it was approximately 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11519)|
| 3:12:04| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| And Mr. Johnson, again, thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11528)|
| 3:12:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11529)|

| 3:12:25| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11550)|
| 3:12:31| seconded by Commissioner Scott-Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11551)|

| 3:14:08| This application required two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| I see no other attendees who are opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11653)|

| 3:14:21| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11661)|
| 3:14:27| This is a rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| and a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| to change the existing CB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| to a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| and to change the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| from general commercial to O office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| This is in line with the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11687)|
| 3:14:51| that took place across Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| in October of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| which is now planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11696)|
| 3:14:58| and office rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11698)|
| 3:14:59| This is an interesting area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| There is a mix of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| industrial and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| along the old Routledge Pike Highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11710)|
| 3:15:18| My client actually just recently acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11718)|
| 3:15:21| the Elevation Food Properties packing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| in that's already existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| in the CB zone on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| And he acquired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11733)|
| 3:15:36| It was a distressed business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11736)|
| 3:15:37| He is trying to keep the business open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| In order to keep the business open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| he needs to be able to expand his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| and to improve access to his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| And in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| he has acquired the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| immediately to the north at 1702 Harris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| which is an old Jehovah's Witness church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| that is no longer in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11759)|
| 3:16:03| It is zoned RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| We had initially explored the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| of rezoning just the 1702 Harris Road property to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11768)|
| 3:16:16| Staff was not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| And we talked about the reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| And we were in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| and we withdrew our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| We came back with the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| of changing all of the property that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| We own two other parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| that stretch along Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| You can see it highlighted there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| That's already CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| To change all of that to planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| and to include this newly acquired property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| at 1702 Harris to make it planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| And so we can be allowed to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| be allowed to improve our access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| using this additional property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| but also make it a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| So we can deed restrict it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| as required by the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| to just the uses that we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| for the existing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| And also it would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11823)|
| 3:17:06| to have a conversation with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11828)|
| 3:17:08| and how to mitigate any potential impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| there may be with this existing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| Should we expand with the planned commercial zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| There's a 50 foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| There's more intensive screening requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| and other tools that the planners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11841)|
| 3:17:24| and the planning commission has to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| that would allow us to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| It makes sense for this existing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| and the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| So that's our concept at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| There was some neighborhood opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| with some concerns about the truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| on Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11860)|
| 3:17:41| when we had sought the rezoning before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| I know my client has reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| to many of the neighbors and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| So I'm hopeful that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| there hasn't been any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| for our current application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| But with that, we would urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| to follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| and approve our sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11880)|
| 3:18:01| and our rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11883)|
| 3:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Moll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| Chair, will you entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11887)|
| 3:18:08| to approve sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| per staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=11893)|

| 3:21:38| I did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12098)|

| 3:23:43| And one for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| But starting with the applicant, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| see that you're draining your street straight into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| And I was just wondering, are you using an oil separator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12233)|

| 3:24:14| two rows of silt bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12254)|

| 3:24:19| But we will have a water quality unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12259)|
| 3:24:25| which will treat the first flush and provide the water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| treatment and stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12268)|

| 3:24:43| of a closed contour line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| And I wanted to ask Mr. Snowden if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| was any engineering trouble in having the road go directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| over a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12291)|

| 3:25:13| certification of that to ensure the road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12313)|

| 3:25:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12321)|
| 3:25:22| And finally, the one-lane bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| that's part of the Coward Mill total improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| that we discussed previously, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12328)|
| 3:25:32| That is, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12332)|
| 3:25:33| We've actually been working with Mr. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| And he has modified his plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12336)|
| 3:25:38| You can kind of see the existing Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12338)|
| 3:25:41| and the center line of future pavement in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| So they've been very good to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| and tried to modify their plans to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| our new road alignment and bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12349)|
| 3:25:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12354)|
| 3:25:54| And then just one last general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| I'm sorry so many questions so late in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| But are there any plans for a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| along Beaver Creek at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| There, we are going to be installing sidewalk on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| And there is some conversation about possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| acquiring a piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12371)|
| 3:26:12| There's a dam there, Coward Mill Dam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| There's some conversation going on about acquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| that and making a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| But as far as greenways, ma'am, I'm not aware of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12385)|

| 3:26:31| No other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| Commissioner Adams, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12396)|
| 3:26:37| Just a clarification of the dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12397)|
| 3:26:41| Because part of the case file refers to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12401)|
| 3:26:45| And then part of the case file refers to 3.23 or 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| Can someone clarify what it actually is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12410)|
| 3:26:56| Yes, this is Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| The property was recently rezoned from 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| Or maybe it's still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12421)|
| 3:27:02| I'm sorry if I don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| But it's going to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| And that's what this is based on, the 3.5 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12427)|
| 3:27:10| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12430)|
| 3:27:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12431)|
| 3:27:11| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12431)|

| 3:30:43| section 3.04.C, that point two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12643)|
| 3:30:53| It says that the proposed street system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| shall provide for the continuance of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12655)|
| 3:30:58| or dedicated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| And there is a street that abuts this property to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12660)|
| 3:31:06| Roughly, it would feed off of lot number 18 called Tommy Ami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12666)|
| 3:31:13| I don't know how to pronounce it, trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12673)|
| 3:31:16| If the staff would put up one of the preceding slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| that shows the area, I'd like to point out where that road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12680)|
| 3:31:37| There in the lower right-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| that road butts right up to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| And I'd like to know why this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| in the subdivision code is not being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12706)|
| 3:31:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12713)|
| 3:31:53| Hello, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12713)|
| 3:31:54| This is Taryn Barrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12716)|
| 3:31:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12719)|
| 3:32:00| So the connection to Tommy Ami trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| was not considered during the review of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12723)|
| 3:32:09| And therefore, staff will need time to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| whether or not this is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| And the review of the road and access to Tommy Ami trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| and Woodell Church Road is into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12739)|
| 3:32:22| The site distance at the intersection of Tommy Ami trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| and Woodell Church Road is questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| And so due to a crest curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| so that would have to be under staff consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| to look at if it was feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12755)|
| 3:32:40| I would like to make a motion then that we postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12760)|
| 3:32:42| How much time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12762)|
| 3:32:53| I guess 30 days, but that would be up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12773)|
| 3:32:58| I'd like to make a motion then to continue this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| because as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12782)|
| 3:33:03| it does not meet the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12783)|
| 3:33:08| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12788)|
| 3:33:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12794)|
| 3:33:15| We have a motion by Commissioner Corbett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| seconded by Commissioner Graft to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=12797)|

| 3:43:12| Or would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13392)|
| 3:43:15| I'll just be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13395)|
| 3:43:16| Scott Williams, 4530,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| Anna Leeway, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| I'm the engineer trying to help my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| My client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| I've worked on an additional new phase to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13407)|
| 3:43:33| that's not shown on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| And as part of trying to get that new phase platted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13415)|
| 3:43:40| I've tried to help my client finish up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| some of the outstanding as-built requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| in the original phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| which was built and built out over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13427)|
| 3:43:51| You see the former approval was 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13431)|
| 3:43:54| So what we ran into is we had a vertical curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13434)|
| 3:43:59| that goes down into a very low area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| crosses a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| And fortunately, even though the AASHTO curve requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13445)|
| 3:44:10| that the city makes you go by are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13450)|
| 3:44:14| it's a little bit shorter than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13454)|
| 3:44:17| So a little bit steeper vertical curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| There's lighting provided along that stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13459)|
| 3:44:23| which is the major problem with sag vertical curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13463)|
| 3:44:28| So that's why I believe engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| was okay with supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| And then as for the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13473)|
| 3:44:36| the unfortunate issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| is the constructability of those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| I believe that's probably why city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| went along with this removal of that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13483)|
| 3:44:48| All the driveways are in essentially in that subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| and typically would be something that we would ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| But in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| due to the, especially the ones on the upper sides of hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13497)|
| 3:45:00| you'd have to rip out practically the whole driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| and re-pour all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13503)|
| 3:45:04| And the community is probably not too keen on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13504)|
| 3:45:07| So we were hopeful that we could get that waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| I don't think in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13510)|
| 3:45:14| it's a bad idea with the limited number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13514)|
| 3:45:16| All the new section that's being put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13516)|
| 3:45:20| has sidewalk and the entrance drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| all the way back to Millertown Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| also has sidewalk on it, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13524)|
| 3:45:26| So we still do have a connection in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| and for the new stuff that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13529)|
| 3:45:32| It's just the things that were approved prior don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| So I'll reserve any of the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| All right, Mr. Murphy, Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13538)|
| 3:45:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13541)|
| 3:45:45| I'm representing Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13545)|
| 3:45:48| We think that the condition that was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| 15 years ago for sidewalks should remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| It sets a dangerous precedent for a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13554)|
| 3:45:58| to accept conditions as part of the approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13558)|
| 3:46:03| that we use commissioners, planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13563)|
| 3:46:08| community developers, spend time negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13568)|
| 3:46:10| and figuring out what's the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13570)|
| 3:46:11| for development to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| We make an agreement, we put a plan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| and then now we've got developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13575)|
| 3:46:18| who come in later and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| oh, well, actually, I'd like to remove some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| In this case, they finished the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| the neighborhoods that we moved into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13585)|
| 3:46:28| and they want to be relieved of one of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13588)|
| 3:46:31| that was with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| and the expectations for putting it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| So removing sidewalks, it's a dangerous precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13595)|
| 3:46:40| because then what other conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| are we going to have applicants agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| when they know that they can go in five or 10 years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13605)|
| 3:46:48| and say, oh, yeah, it's a little tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13608)|
| 3:46:49| we already built it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| I'm also kind of puzzled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13611)|
| 3:46:52| We hear the same story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13612)|
| 3:46:54| We hear stories from developers that say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| they would rather put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| after the driveways and the houses are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13618)|
| 3:47:00| because the sidewalks get torn up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| during the construction process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| Yet we hear developers say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13624)|
| 3:47:06| it's really tough to put the sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13626)|
| 3:47:10| after construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13630)|
| 3:47:10| because now we've got to tear up everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| So as a community member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13634)|
| 3:47:17| that's not a developer, engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| or sidewalk construction expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13641)|
| 3:47:22| I hear it both ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| and I don't know which one to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| So I'm just expressing confusion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13647)|
| 3:47:31| some people say it's hard to do it one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| some do it the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13652)|
| 3:47:33| But KCPA would ask you to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13653)|
| 3:47:36| the sidewalk condition in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13656)|
| 3:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| This was discussed at some length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| at the agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| and I would ask Mr. Wise to kind of chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13666)|
| 3:47:50| And he sent out an email to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13670)|
| 3:47:53| so I would like him to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13673)|
| 3:47:57| on the Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13677)|
| 3:48:01| After the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13681)|
| 3:48:02| I had a chance to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13682)|
| 3:48:06| lawyers with each of the two law departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13686)|
| 3:48:08| that handled these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13688)|
| 3:48:11| and their responses were pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13691)|
| 3:48:15| with regard, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13695)|
| 3:48:16| the question I posed to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13696)|
| 3:48:17| was could the performance bond be forfeited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13697)|
| 3:48:22| caused to be forfeited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13702)|
| 3:48:25| due to a failure to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13705)|
| 3:48:28| with an application to have the matter go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13708)|
| 3:48:31| And they acknowledge this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13711)|
| 3:48:32| an ongoing problem for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13712)|
| 3:48:35| and they're fully aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13715)|
| 3:48:36| and they don't really have any good solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13716)|
| 3:48:38| The county has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13718)|
| 3:48:40| and you recall on Pleasant Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| the similar situation where a built out subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| in the city's approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| I guess the mission was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13729)|
| 3:48:52| take the performance bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13732)|
| 3:48:53| require the developer to build out a sidewalk offsite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| in order to access a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13736)|
| 3:48:58| and it was worked out for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| of the neighborhood and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13740)|
| 3:49:05| And that has been the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| that the county law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| and I suppose Ms. Snowden and county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| has been pursuing to make the best of a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13751)|
| 3:49:15| The city is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| they too have looked at it from that perspective as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13757)|
| 3:49:21| but they don't have a specific policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13761)|
| 3:49:27| What happened is these lots got sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| before the construction was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| and before the bond could have been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| And there's no ability for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| to cause a forfeiture of a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13776)|
| 3:49:38| because the bond does not run to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13778)|
| 3:49:41| Some communities they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| but in Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| the bonds run to the engineering departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| of the two respective local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13786)|
| 3:49:48| and they actually have control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13788)|
| 3:49:50| And these are things that are performance bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13790)|
| 3:49:53| or surety bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| which are tied to specific tasks being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| And so the forfeiture can't be redirected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| to another purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| That's the position that the law departments are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13802)|
| 3:50:06| So the bonding of the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13806)|
| 3:50:10| is not a tool that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13810)|
| 3:50:12| other than through negotiation with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| in order to induce them to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| maybe other than if it's deemed to be impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13818)|
| 3:50:21| to complete the sidewalks that are originally designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13821)|
| 3:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13824)|
| 3:50:30| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13830)|
| 3:50:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13834)|
| 3:50:35| I have a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| for either county engineering or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13836)|
| 3:50:42| I know that there are various inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13842)|
| 3:50:44| that must be done as homes are constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| When it comes to civil inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| are sidewalks something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13850)|
| 3:50:53| you know, when they're inspecting the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13853)|
| 3:50:56| or any grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13856)|
| 3:50:57| is there someone that would see or check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13857)|
| 3:51:00| and see that sidewalks are being put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13860)|
| 3:51:03| at that point during an inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13863)|
| 3:51:11| City engineering, are you still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| I'm here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13874)|
| 3:51:16| In general, under kind of modern way that we operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13876)|
| 3:51:20| that is, that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| We have inspectors that go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13882)|
| 3:51:23| and validate that the sidewalk gets put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13886)|
| 3:51:30| Years ago, our staff wasn't as robust as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13890)|
| 3:51:33| And our inspections weren't quite as frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13898)|
| 3:51:39| And so not being privy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13899)|
| 3:51:44| not being privy to land sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| you know, land sales happen in a private transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13906)|
| 3:51:49| And so the city's not privy to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| So a lot of times on a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| the lots get sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| and then individual home builders may buy those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13915)|
| 3:51:59| and build on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| And so at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13921)|
| 3:52:04| the inspections weren't what they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13924)|
| 3:52:08| And because of some of these issues that we've run into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13928)|
| 3:52:10| we have changed our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13930)|
| 3:52:12| in the way that we operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13932)|
| 3:52:13| to help mitigate these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13933)|
| 3:52:16| Okay, I do recall a case we had earlier a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13936)|
| 3:52:22| And I believe that that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| they were requesting how that condition removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13944)|
| 3:52:27| I believe that that was being finished out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| between 2017 and 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13950)|
| 3:52:33| So that's a much more recent instance where it wasn't caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13953)|
| 3:52:38| And so my next question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| if someone can confirm or deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13962)|
| 3:52:45| the sidewalk ordinance is a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13965)|
| 3:52:50| It's not anything to be held up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13970)|
| 3:52:53| A developer could absolutely decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13973)|
| 3:52:56| And in this case, the next half of this phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| the sidewalks are conditioned for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| as far as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13982)|
| 3:53:03| and they could come back in 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| and not have done it and we'll say it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13986)|
| 3:53:09| Is that my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13989)|
| 3:53:15| I'm not familiar with the case that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=13995)|
| 3:53:21| And could you rephrase the last portion of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14001)|
| 3:53:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| For the second half of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14005)|
| 3:53:28| could very well not have sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| and no one would hold them to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14010)|
| 3:53:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14013)|
| 3:53:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14014)|
| 3:53:36| No, as it is now, the way it's being permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| they are required to install the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| And again, because of similar issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| that we've run into in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| we have a little bit different process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| of how those are inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| and making sure that those get implemented correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14032)|
| 3:53:55| making sure that timing is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14035)|
| 3:53:58| Gotcha, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14038)|
| 3:54:04| Is that all Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| You know, I have a problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| to be quite honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| but we're up against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14052)|
| 3:54:15| My guess is that the bond is not sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14055)|
| 3:54:19| in any regard after 15 years to build sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14059)|
| 3:54:24| particularly once the driveways have all been installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14064)|
| 3:54:29| And why it's, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| this is a local government responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14071)|
| 3:54:36| There's probably not the funds available to put these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14076)|
| 3:54:40| I don't know if we have any other recourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| but to approve the recommendation of staff on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14082)|
| 3:54:47| but I'm open toward suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14087)|
| 3:54:52| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| Yeah, I had to step away for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14095)|
| 3:54:57| and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14097)|
| 3:54:58| but did the applicant say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| why the sidewalks weren't installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14100)|
| 3:55:04| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14104)|
| 3:55:07| Mr. Williams, would you like to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14107)|
| 3:55:08| to Mr. Commissioner Scott Smith's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14108)|
| 3:55:13| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14113)|
| 3:55:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14115)|
| 3:55:16| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| The exact reasoning, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| and I don't want to put words in his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| but I believe this was another victim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14122)|
| 3:55:24| of the downturn in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14124)|
| 3:55:27| And I believe that those lots have been sold off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| over years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| And I believe what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14131)|
| 3:55:32| you got an infrastructure put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| you had a lot of vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| you had a developer who was out of money totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14136)|
| 3:55:39| and you were just waiting for money to come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14139)|
| 3:55:42| And over time, they sold the lots off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14142)|
| 3:55:45| He's doing this, if it helps him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14145)|
| 3:55:47| he's doing this next phase, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| just to get out of the hole on the original phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| Everybody remembers the ugly times, I sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| So I believe that, unfortunately, is the reasoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14155)|
| 3:55:58| And as for the physical ability to put the sidewalk in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14158)|
| 3:56:02| a lot of the driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14162)|
| 3:56:05| it's one thing to go in and cut in a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| and a lot of people visualize that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14167)|
| 3:56:10| But on all these driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| most of the time they take off from the back of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14172)|
| 3:56:15| and they just go straight up or straight down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| Now, not all of them in there are like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| but there's several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14179)|
| 3:56:20| And to get them drivable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14180)|
| 3:56:22| to where the front end of the car wouldn't hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14182)|
| 3:56:25| may be physically impossible on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14185)|
| 3:56:28| And that's the biggest headache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14188)|
| 3:56:30| and I believe that's the biggest reason here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| that we're fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14192)|
| 3:56:34| As for, I heard someone speak a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14194)|
| 3:56:40| precedent setting and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14200)|
| 3:56:43| If I remember correctly, back in the 05 and that era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14203)|
| 3:56:46| sidewalks were looked at differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14206)|
| 3:56:47| They could or could not be negotiated in or out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| of concept plan approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| and were not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| unless you were within a mile of the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14214)|
| 3:56:59| They may still be the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14219)|
| 3:57:00| I don't know if they changed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14220)|
| 3:57:02| for the last passing of the subdivision ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14222)|
| 3:57:05| but anyway, that's how that came down was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14225)|
| 3:57:11| I'm sure it was just a product of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| And so as stuff sold off over years and years of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14233)|
| 3:57:19| that's what's ended up happening, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Okay, one, just finish this thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| I would agree with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14243)|
| 3:57:24| And I know for other commissioners that have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14244)|
| 3:57:27| that today people just either do sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14247)|
| 3:57:29| if they feel like it and they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| I can tell you that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14251)|
| 3:57:34| We have substantial bonding requirements placed on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| when sidewalks are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| And the way the sidewalks are installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| is when the lots are graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14261)|
| 3:57:44| And we grade lots now, whereas back in 05| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14264)|
| 3:57:47| and prior to that, we just put roads in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| and then you left the land kind of how it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14270)|
| 3:57:51| and people dealt with the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| But today people pretty much prepare the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14273)|
| 3:57:56| and allocate grade for sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| and whatever's required at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| So I don't feel like this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| I think this is something that is one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14282)|
| 3:58:06| from the past that just did not get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14286)|
| 3:58:09| And I think there was a failure all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14289)|
| 3:58:12| Inspectors didn't catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| We had a terrible time in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| And it seems like regardless of whose fault it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14297)|
| 3:58:20| the best solution is to, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| approve the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| I know that nobody likes to hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14305)|
| 3:58:26| but I'm not sure if there's a better solution right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14306)|
| 3:58:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14311)|
| 3:58:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14313)|
| 3:58:35| I pretty much wanna repeat what Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14315)|
| 3:58:39| but his words were it was a failure all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14319)|
| 3:58:42| And I think that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| except right now we're seeing the community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| they are partnered with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| to put trees in where that sidewalk might've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14329)|
| 3:58:52| At least that's the way I was reading the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14332)|
| 3:58:54| So they're doing their best to make a bad situation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14334)|
| 3:58:59| And that's kind of the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14339)|
| 3:59:00| that's making me a little more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14340)|
| 3:59:01| with going ahead and voting for this variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14341)|
| 3:59:04| because I don't think that it's really possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14344)|
| 3:59:05| to put those sidewalks in at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14345)|
| 3:59:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14347)|
| 3:59:10| Commissioner Cormillick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14350)|
| 3:59:13| Yes, I have a question for the applicants engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14353)|
| 3:59:16| What is the purpose of lot 109?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14356)|
| 3:59:23| Let's see, I have to find lot 109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14363)|
| 3:59:28| It kind of aligns somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14368)|
| 3:59:33| with the subdivision to the lower right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14373)|
| 3:59:37| Lower right, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14377)|
| 3:59:38| I'm pulling it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14378)|
| 3:59:39| I got away from it for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14382)|
| 3:59:47| Lower right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14387)|
| 3:59:55| Do you see the empty lot between the two homes on the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14395)|
| 3:59:58| Sorry, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14398)|
| 3:59:59| Yeah, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14399)|
| 4:00:04| It's too narrow for a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14404)|
| 4:00:09| On the, which road please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14409)|
| 4:00:12| Is it Autumn Creek or Meadowells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14412)|
| 4:00:13| Autumn Creek's the upper road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| and Meadowells is the lower road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14415)|
| 4:00:18| I just want to know what is the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14418)|
| 4:00:20| of the highlighted lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14420)|
| 4:00:23| Highlighted lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14423)|
| 4:00:24| I'm sorry, I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14424)|
| 4:00:25| I'm not looking at the right key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14425)|
| 4:00:26| Look at the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14426)|
| 4:00:28| Can you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14428)|
| 4:00:28| Oh, okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| I see it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14430)|
| 4:00:31| Oh, the purpose of that is a future right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14431)|
| 4:00:35| to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14435)|
| 4:00:38| Can we, although we may be giving up the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14438)|
| 4:00:44| can we at least retain the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| to put a sidewalk in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| so that at least we have some going back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14450)|
| 4:00:54| between the different residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14454)|
| 4:00:55| and the different neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14455)|
| 4:00:59| I don't believe that there's enough physical room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14459)|
| 4:01:03| to put a sidewalk in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| I don't believe that there's enough physical right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14465)|
| 4:01:09| to get, do you see the offset at the right side of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14469)|
| 4:01:14| That's why I was thinking it could only be sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14474)|
| 4:01:18| It's actually got to be as part of the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14478)|
| 4:01:21| of the new section of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14481)|
| 4:01:24| That cut through has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14484)|
| 4:01:26| to be installed through there as a actual road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| I don't believe there's going to be room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| for anything beyond just the pavement itself through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14493)|
| 4:01:37| And it's because of that offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| I don't know the evolution of how that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| but it has occurred and it is offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| similar to how it looks right there on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| I also don't think that the subdivision next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14507)|
| 4:01:50| has sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14510)|
| 4:01:53| Well, then an asphalt pathway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| but some way to get that connection going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14515)|
| 4:01:59| until something bigger comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14519)|
| 4:02:02| There is going to be a driveway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14522)|
| 4:02:06| It's part of the new plan of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14526)|
| 4:02:10| There will be a drive through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14530)|
| 4:02:13| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14533)|
| 4:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14533)|
| 4:02:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14534)|
| 4:02:19| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| You need to unmute, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14544)|
| 4:02:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| Steve Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14551)|
| 4:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14554)|
| 4:02:34| I wanted to add to the connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14554)|
| 4:02:37| Knox County is concerned there's not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14557)|
| 4:02:39| right away there to make that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| So we've asked the developer to stake that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| and provide us with a plan to verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| that connection can even take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14565)|
| 4:02:48| I just wanted to interject that to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14568)|
| 4:02:50| that we're not 100% sure with the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14570)|
| 4:02:54| and the topography and the limited right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14574)|
| 4:02:58| that was provided that that connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14578)|
| 4:02:59| can even be made between those two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14579)|
| 4:03:03| Well, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| I just by looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=14585)|

| 4:15:18| prior to submitting to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15318)|
| 4:15:20| that this was a permitted use or an available use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15320)|
| 4:15:24| And everybody agreed that this proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15324)|
| 4:15:27| would be defined as recovery housing under the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15327)|
| 4:15:30| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15330)|
| 4:15:31| Property is presently cut zone OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15331)|
| 4:15:34| and recovery housing is known as or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15334)|
| 4:15:38| determined to be a use permitted on review in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15338)|
| 4:15:45| There are certain additional use on review standards associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15345)|
| 4:15:49| with the approval of a use for recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15349)|
| 4:15:53| And as noted in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15353)|
| 4:15:56| Journey Pure's proposal complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15356)|
| 4:15:57| with all of these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15357)|
| 4:16:01| We've also had the opportunity to meet with several local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| leaders to discuss the Journey Pure's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15363)|
| 4:16:06| use as a recovery housing for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15366)|
| 4:16:09| And the response has been very favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15369)|
| 4:16:12| from these local leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15372)|
| 4:16:14| Most of the opposition that's been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15374)|
| 4:16:20| mainly seems to oppose this as it is close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15380)|
| 4:16:23| to Halls Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15383)|
| 4:16:26| I would point out in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15386)|
| 4:16:27| I do think this is very important to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15387)|
| 4:16:30| this distinction, and it's reflected in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15390)|
| 4:16:33| as well, that there is no restriction in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15393)|
| 4:16:37| to the proximity of recovery housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15397)|
| 4:16:41| as to where it's located in regards to whether it's located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| next to a school or a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15403)|
| 4:16:44| There is no setback or there is no distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15404)|
| 4:16:49| The individuals that this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| and that Journey Pure's facilities serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| there are four people that are seeking treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15413)|
| 4:16:57| and that are serious about treating their addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15419)|
| 4:17:00| The majority of these people have full-time employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15420)|
| 4:17:03| and they are on leave from work to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15423)|
| 4:17:06| to this inpatient facility to begin their addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15426)|
| 4:17:11| treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15431)|
| 4:17:12| They are supported by families and loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15432)|
| 4:17:15| that are very involved in their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15435)|
| 4:17:18| and in their treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15438)|
| 4:17:20| I offered with my submittal earlier in the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15440)|
| 4:17:23| a letter of support from the mayor of the city of Norris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15443)|
| 4:17:27| as evidence to show that the type of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15447)|
| 4:17:32| that Journey Pure runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15452)|
| 4:17:34| This time I'd like to pass, stop my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15454)|
| 4:17:37| hand it to Mr. Kevin Lee on behalf of Journey Pure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15457)|
| 4:17:43| Kevin, excuse me, Kevin Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15463)|
| 4:17:45| Address is 9102 Heritage Drive, Brentwood, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15465)|
| 4:17:52| If approved, this facility will serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15472)|
| 4:17:54| as a place for people to come to heal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15474)|
| 4:17:57| to spend time with licensed professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| and other people who also want to become healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15479)|
| 4:18:03| The purpose of our services is to help persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15483)|
| 4:18:06| who abuse alcohol or other drugs to develop coping mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15486)|
| 4:18:10| and learn to manage their behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15490)|
| 4:18:12| so they do not crave alcohol or other drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15492)|
| 4:18:16| As Taylor indicated, our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15496)|
| 4:18:17| are for men and women who've chosen to come to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15497)|
| 4:18:22| No one forces them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15502)|
| 4:18:24| They won't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15504)|
| 4:18:25| And they stay in our facility for two to four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15505)|
| 4:18:29| and then leave feeling healthy and capable of staying healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15509)|
| 4:18:33| Normally, these folks are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15513)|
| 4:18:34| Most of them use their Blue Cross insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15514)|
| 4:18:37| to get treatment with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15517)|
| 4:18:40| They're brought to our facility by a friend or a spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15520)|
| 4:18:44| or a Journey Pure staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15524)|
| 4:18:46| and they leave the facility only with a Journey Pure staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15526)|
| 4:18:50| or when they finish treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15530)|
| 4:18:52| And our clients do not have a car at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15532)|
| 4:18:56| There is no drug traffic in any form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| around any of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15538)|
| 4:19:00| Drugs and alcohol are not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15540)|
| 4:19:02| and no one comes around trying to sell drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15542)|
| 4:19:05| because there's no demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| As Taylor indicated, Journey Pure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| operates programs in three other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| That's Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15551)|
| 4:19:14| We have approximately 250 clients on any given day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15554)|
| 4:19:18| staying in one of our 18 facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15558)|
| 4:19:21| They're all in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15561)|
| 4:19:25| And since we opened in Murfreesboro in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| two new houses have been constructed next to our campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15567)|
| 4:19:31| I'll add these final comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15571)|
| 4:19:32| Journey Pure was recently engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15572)|
| 4:19:34| by the city of Knoxville as a preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15574)|
| 4:19:37| provider of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| We do operate in Knoxville and in Norris already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15579)|
| 4:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| I've got three individuals signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15586)|
| 4:19:49| but I only see Miss Rhonda Vineyard, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15589)|
| 4:19:53| actually on this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15593)|
| 4:19:56| Miss Vineyard, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15596)|
| 4:20:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15600)|
| 4:20:01| I would just like to ask a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15601)|
| 4:20:04| Number one, are there any special precautions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15604)|
| 4:20:08| for being across the street from the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15608)|
| 4:20:11| I'm not sure where your other facilities are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15611)|
| 4:20:15| but will anyone mention any safety concerns at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15615)|
| 4:20:20| Yes, Miss Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15620)|
| 4:20:21| This is Kevin Lee speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| We are close to schools in Norris, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15623)|
| 4:20:27| and on Maryville Pike south of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15627)|
| 4:20:31| also in Bowling Green, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15631)|
| 4:20:32| It's not unusual for us to be close to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15632)|
| 4:20:36| As I mentioned earlier, our clients, once they get to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15636)|
| 4:20:41| they don't leave our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| They can, but they don't leave our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15643)|
| 4:20:46| without being attended by an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15646)|
| 4:20:48| And we have two staff members for every patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15648)|
| 4:20:54| approximately at all times on the campus in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15654)|
| 4:20:59| except in overnight hours while people are sleeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15659)|
| 4:21:02| and then that staff to patient ratio obviously drops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15662)|
| 4:21:07| So in the years we've been doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| I've been doing it about 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15669)|
| 4:21:11| and in Journey Impure, almost seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15671)|
| 4:21:13| We've not had any instances in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15673)|
| 4:21:17| of any adverse consequences at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15677)|
| 4:21:20| That's not to say it couldn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15680)|
| 4:21:22| but as I mentioned earlier, these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15682)|
| 4:21:24| come to us of their own volition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15684)|
| 4:21:26| They want to get healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15686)|
| 4:21:28| They're there, and they're not bad actors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15688)|
| 4:21:35| OK, so one of the questions, I know this is getting late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15695)|
| 4:21:40| is this program for men and women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15700)|
| 4:21:43| Are there going to be men and women in one in that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15703)|
