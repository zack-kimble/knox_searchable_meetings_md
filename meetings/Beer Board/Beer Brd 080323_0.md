| 0:00:55| when we have had him in the past. We'd ask for approval of the of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=55)|

| 0:01:53| requested a deferral to March of 2000 and nine. Move. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=113)|

| 0:02:24| address of the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| or your or Market Square in Knoxville, Tennessee. 37902. Officer Husky. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| record. It's Mark. We're waiting on approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| fire inspector, health department and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| I have my task certification. I took that last Thursday. We just need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| copy of the document. Okay. That's where Brown. I was about to ask when she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| planned on taking the task class. So you took it last Thursday. Yes, sir. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| you happen to have it with you today? Your certification? No, but I can send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| that in. Do we have anything that would dispute with? Not? She went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| We know it one way or the other. I wouldn't have one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| without looking on the computer. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| you. Miss Philip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Well, Miss Clunaris, I think this may be the most unusual request I've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| considered that would come before us. Tell me something about your plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| this venue. It's a cafe, bakery, coffeehouse and music venue on Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| Square, and it's a non for profit. The four market square is non for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Four market square entertainment is a for profit owned by four market square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| Well, I guess I'm very confused by the charter, which reads it's a non for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| And the purpose, I believe, is to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| downtown Knoxville. No, ma'am. Well, it's it's part of the fellows program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| downtown four market square, which is to develop young adults in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| downtown area and encourage them to stay in the Knoxville area to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| their careers. It is a Christian based organization, but it's it's a Christian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| based organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| I was just reading from the charter, which is are you reading from the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| market square charter or four market square entertainment charter of Cafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| well, I could have my attorney come. I well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| the name of the corporation is Cafe for would that be your doing business as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| cafe for the name of the corporation is four market square entertainment. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| just reading from the charter for Cafe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| I need you to help me distinguish if you can. A four market square is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| non for profit that owns four market square entertainment. Four market square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| entertainment is doing business at Cafe for and the square room square room is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| a music venue. Cafe for is a restaurant, bakery and coffee house. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| somehow I feel that the business name is Cafe for it is. Yes, ma'am. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| who is asking for the beer permit. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| But there's not a there's not a per se owner. I mean, I'm the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| manager. So it's a board. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| so in our in our we provided an explanation when we submitted for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| license of all the parties. But I was just reading from from the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| charter, and I don't know where the explanation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| I provided it to Wanda Day. Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| Understand this a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Well, I hope I do, and I hope I just failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| find that. Can you tell me what your concerns are? Maybe I could address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| those. Yeah, and they're my personal concerns. Okay, I just have. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| think it's very ironic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| And I had to assume that Cafe for is requesting the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| and this will be permitted Cafe for, and their mission is to spread. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| reading now to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Tennessee, through hospitality and service number two to seek peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| health and Shalom in the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, and three to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| end to serve the community in the greater Knoxville area through operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| of an establishment serving refreshment for body and soul and as a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| haven for the gathering and fellowship of members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| And somehow I find it personally very ironic that it's necessary to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| beer for that purpose. Well, our goal is to provide food and drink for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| the masses, and it doesn't make sense to only reach out to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| who are already believers. I mean, what's the point? The whole point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| to be a lighthouse basically in the downtown Knoxville area and to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| out to those who may not have a lifestyle that leads them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| live in accordance with just basic family values. But we are not preaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is a Christian founded. I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| but that's just one part of it. Basically, it's through our works and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| through our hospitality that we'll be reaching out to people. We're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| going to be preaching from the restaurant. It's not at all. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I have no problem with that. The money goes to help the Fellows Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| which is a Christian based organization. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Councilman Prowl. Thank you. I kind of concur with Councilman Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| Let me tell you the paperwork we have. We have one thing, the business name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Cafe 4. The owner information is 4MC LLC. We have another thing called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| 4MS Entertainment. We have another form that says Cafe 4. Another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| says Cafe 4. One that changes the name from Cafe 4 to 4MS Entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| Inc. The charter of Cafe 4 and the Tennessee Department of Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| Certificate of Registration is for 4MS Entertainment. Right. So there are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| number of names, but be that as it's may, what are y'all trying to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| We're just opening a coffee house, bakery, dining room, music venue. When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| I'm sorry. December 1. Okay. Because I eat across Market Square from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| and watch the construction going on. I was just out there Tuesday. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| still going on. So thanks. Councilman Becker. I guess I'm going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| approval pending final documentation. Second. Any further discussion? No, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| I'm going to recuse myself because personally, I just see a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| conflict here and I realize it's a no vote. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=573)|
| 0:09:44| no. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=584)|
| 0:09:53| Caribbean Bob Restaurant and Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=593)|
| 0:10:09| Good afternoon. Could you give us your name and address, please? The address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| is Caribbean Vibes Restaurant and Club, 1717 White Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| Tennessee. Officer Husky. No applicable record. Ms. Martin. We're waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| on approval from the building inspector and a final business tax return from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| the former business owner. That should have been provided because I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| copy of the inspection from the fire marshal and everything here. We just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| need a copy for our files. Councilman Becker. I guess I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| and move approval pending final documentation. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Concessions by Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Clearly, people still wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| I'm Charles Fowler with concessions by Cox 3301 Magnolia Avenue. Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| No applicable record. Ms. Martin. File is complete. Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| Any discussion? Councilman Roddy. Thank you, Chairman. I called the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| permitting office, yes, Ms. Day, earlier this week to ask if we had received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| any more information from this applicant, because when we considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| this at our last meeting, I think the beer board made it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| there was some concerns about this, and the information was provided in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| our packet this evening, so I have not had time to review it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| detail in terms of looking at what the access points are and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| carding is taking place and that kind of thing. And I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| ask Officer Husky if he's had a chance to review this or if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| has worked on this schematic with concessions by Cox, and if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| give us some feedback on that, please, sir. I have received the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| landing layout that I think that you may have. Captain Roush has, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| believe, worked out the security for them. I do not know the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| as far as where they're going to card or armband, and I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| that there's a way that the pedestrians will be able to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| through this area, so they won't have to walk up around Nayland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| but I'm not sure by this map that I can tell where that is, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| other than that, I don't have any more information. Sir, how do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| plan to limit access to the alcohol for underage people attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| the game and yet also allow a safe passage of pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| back and forth along Nayland? Okay. All at the entrances, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| will be uniform Knoxville police officers, and they will be posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| at each entrance. There will be four officers posted. And where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| the entrances exactly? Because I guess I don't understand. Basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| at the bike racks. Okay. So wherever you see a bike rack is an entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Well, the two outside bike racks. Okay. For the front. And those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| police officers would check to see if I were coming in, if I had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| armband, or what are they checking? They would check the armband and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| to make sure that minors don't get in, which most of the time you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| don't have too much trouble with minors when you have uniformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| officers present. Okay. But if I have been dining, say, at Calhoun's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| or someplace else east of this, and I want to walk to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| it's not safe to walk along Nayland. So I guess... You would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| allowed to go through, but you couldn't buy a beer unless you had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| armband. Okay. So if I'm a minor and I say I want to walk through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| but I'm really going to drink beer, then I just get in, but then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| don't have a wristband? Is that... In that way, you wouldn't, if a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| minor talked their way in and didn't have a wristband, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| they wouldn't be sold, and they would also be carded that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| bartender's trained to pick out minors. And where is the carding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| area where the wristbands are distributed? That they'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| be done at each entrance. Okay. So where it says bike rack, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| have carding stations. That's where the carding stations will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| close to where the uniformed officers are. Okay. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| listen to some other discussion. Councilman Frost. I have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| she got to them, but first, but I mean, you know, if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| be... If you're coming from Calhoun's, you're going to... To me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| it sounds like you're going to be impeded somewhat to get to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| you're wanting to go, and you don't really have an alternative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| go around this. I mean, you've got to go through the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| even though you're not going to the event. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| I mean, if you don't want to go through a police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| checkpoint, where do you go? That you would probably pass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| checkpoint, but you couldn't buy any beer unless you do have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| armband. So they're not going to be stopped? They will be not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| stopped per se if they're not trying to buy beer or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| We don't have... So is everybody going to be stopped or is nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| going to be stopped? I'm not... I don't mean to be obtuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| but I'm missing something. That normally the flow, the beer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| be more to the back. Is it the back of the river side or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| The river side. Okay. And that there will be a walk path to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| the front side where that you wouldn't be obstructed of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| But looking at the diagram, the stage area, I know this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| to scale or anything, but the stage area gets close to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| those tables are. So it seems like there's a choke point down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| to get through that area, to get across the public waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| to get to a game, even if you don't want to go to this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| I just have some concerns about that. Councilman Helquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| So what you're saying is that the police that are performing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| security duty there will let anybody enter the area, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| won't let them leave if they have a beer in their hand? Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| I'm trying to figure out why they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| They would not let you leave with a beer in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| That's the only function they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| They would also not let you buy a beer unless you've been carded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| and have a wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Okay. So they're watching the sellers to make sure that whoever's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| selling the beer, the vendors, to make sure that they don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Bartenders, of course, they're trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| But you have police officers hovering over them, watching them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| They're basically watching them and the public. And like I say, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| have a uniformed officer present, usually you don't have too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| So if Ms. Roddy comes through with her children in tow, her non-adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| children in tow, then they can just walk right through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Right on. We wouldn't impede the traffic in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| But it would be a separate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Okay. Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| I guess just a question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| You have lists happening on UT home games. Is it going to be the day of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| the day before? What's the... The day of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| And somewhere around the game, before, after, all day? What's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| the time? Basically, the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| would be, I'm sure, before the game. And I'm not sure about after the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| I'd have to check on that part. You know, I guess my comment, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| I hear you, Mr. Cross, about the impeding movement. But, you know, when we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| sundown in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| it's a lot of impeded movement on Market Square. And it feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| a little bit the same way, that there's, you know, there's a check for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| getting an ID to buy beer. There's trouble walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| through. But, you know, it's still possible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| It's a little bit of a worry, but not a huge concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Councilman Frost. Thank you. Thinking about this, since this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| for every home game, I have an idea. You know, personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| I'm not overly impressed with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| the plan is before us. So if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| this is set, and we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| come back and revisit it. Does anyone see any merit to only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| passing this for the next game or two to see how it works, to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| it needs to be tweaked at a later date? And if so, take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| up after a couple of home games are under our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Because at least when Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| has sundown in the city, you're not having to get into busy streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| You do have sidewalks that you can go down. This, you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| a river on one side and Naland Drive on the other. So just throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| that out and see what folks think about it. Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you. Yeah. You know, I guess the Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Square comparison is close, but it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| ring true for me because you can still enter and exit Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| without having to pass by an entrance with a police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| officer and be vetted. I mean, you can enter Market Square, walk through it, walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| in, walk out, and not participate in the beer park and not be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| And I guess I just expected a more detailed security plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| than we've been provided tonight. This schematic diagram, not only did it not come in until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| we sat down tonight, but there's no narrative to go with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| explaining how the police officers are going to be engaged in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| and how underage drinking is going to be addressed specifically and how we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| prevent open containers from leaving this site. And I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| have a problem with blocking off a public park and impeding pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| for the purpose of selling beer. So I just don't feel I can support this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Councilman Holquist. Councilman Pelaw was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| ahead of me on her line. Oh, I just had just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| It appears to me that whether your plan works or not and is successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| and I'm sure you hope it would be, that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| depends totally on the police officers. I don't see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| you have created any time frame for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| business operation. I just don't see that you have any parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| It appears to just be up to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| officers whom I presume you would hire. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| And our people are trained. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| that that's a great deal to put on the officers because if you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| a police officer, it's just going to be assumed that they are there to assist the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| public. And without any more defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| area than you have, I think that it may be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| difficult for officers to give you this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| assurance that they can manage this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| when we go to the ballgames, it's a crowd of people and they're all trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| somewhere at the same time. And I'm We manage beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| and liquor at large events all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Yes, sir. I understand. I'm just concerned. Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| I'm just concerned about Knoxville on the game. Like I'm saying that our people are trained, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| that not only the police officers, but our people are trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| bartenders. Well, that's just a comment I felt compelled to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Councilman Hopeless. Well, I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| agree with Councilman Pelos' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| I'm also concerned or in relation to that, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| concerned that we're turning our off-duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| police officers that are working this extra time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| additional income for security work, that we're turning them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| into beer sales managers. And I'm afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| that's crossing a line that, you know, it's one of those gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| areas that when have you really crossed the line? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| It really concerns me that we are putting on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| now the responsibility of managing beer sales. It sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| they're supposed to be watching the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| bartenders or vendors, according to this gentleman, to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| they, you know, that they sell correctly. And that is not their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| I don't think that there's Sir, I wasn't talking to you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| I appreciate your willingness to provide input, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| I'm not done yet. And also, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| I would agree with Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| I'm not real comfortable with this plan and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Councilman Frost also. It is not analogous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| to Market Square totally. There are some similarities and there are some differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| But I just, I'm afraid that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| going to be restrictive. I just have some real problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| But if Councilman Frost wants to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| approve this for only perhaps two of those home game days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I would be much more open to doing that. If that's your suggestion, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| then I would be to approve it for the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| remainder of the schedule for the season. Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| I kind of like Mr. Frost's idea as well. But I wanted to ask, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Mickey Maloney is in the audience, who I think is one of our great sort of event gurus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| in town. I wanted to ask if she has an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| I guess what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| would like to say that this has been done for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| several years in the past. Last year it was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| And we got several calls from people wanting to know why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| we weren't doing it. The reason we weren't doing it was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| a little over a year ago we passed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| programming of volunteer landing to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So they chose not to do it, not because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| weren't asked. I just don't think they knew to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| So this year, South Central Radio Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| 97.5 came to us and said, would you be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| willing to work with us to do the volunteer Rocky Top Rally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| again? And we said, yes, we will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| So we have not taken over the landing again. We simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| agreed to help them in putting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| The site plan was just the same. And we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| have bike racks with, we have two bike racks at each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| end with a pathway in between. There does not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| we've never had a problem with traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| through there. It was the same plan we presented for the Honda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Hoot. Same concessionaire, same plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| So we've never had a problem with traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| We've never had a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| beer. We're actually much safer having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| our plan down there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| as it is, we do know that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| the police down there, and they are not there on a regular basis unless we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| are there because the beer just flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| from Calhoun's. And they do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| a police force there to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| So we are much better off if we have our event there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| in order to have KPD there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Any other, can I help in any other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Councilman Bailey. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| kind of run a couple things out there. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| we've talked about this in the past, that having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| these beer gardens and so forth at public events. And I'm one that thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| that, you know, the more supervision and the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| organized events like this you have, the more civil it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| And as we just heard, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I think it's pretty clear there's a lot of that going on out there. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| to have some supervision and some security like this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| I'm also, after the last meeting, I've contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| the police department just to let them know that I'm glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| when I came on council, I believe we didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| the police department didn't allow the officers to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| overtime or off duty like this. I believe I'm correct. And now, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| we do, which I'm glad to see that happen. Before, I think the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| department were hired to do a lot of these things. And I'm glad to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| if our officers want to do this, that they have the opportunity to go out there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| And I think what we've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| is not necessarily the greatest presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I think that whole ball game traffic down there, people walking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| like that, it's fluid, it's off and on. And I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| interested to see really how it works. And so I think that Councilman Frost's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| idea of sort of a look and see is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| And that, you know, we ought to see if the traffic can flow there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Neyland Drive and the river, you know, on both sides. And I think that's kind of a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| But I also can see where people could walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| there, and if they want to go in there and purchase beer and food and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| and if they're 21, they get carded, they get a wristband, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| can go in there and do so. So I think, you know, it's sort of a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| decision that I think we need to be consistent on as a beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| that if we're going to allow these things that, you know, we need a good plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and then maybe on a situation like this in a new area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| or one that we haven't seen lately, that we could try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| And if I wanted to ask Mr. Swanson, you know, how could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| we go about Mr. Frost's plan? How could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I think Mr. Frost has a motion prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And I think that's all I had. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| Well, not to dispute Mickey Maloney, but with the Honda Hoot issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| that's fine. I understand that. But there's not a UT game going on where people are trying to get to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| But I've got the, thanks to Mr. Swanson, I've got the football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| schedule in front of me. And October 4th, hopefully we're going to beat northern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Illinois. Then we play on October 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Mississippi State. The next regularly scheduled beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| is going to be on October the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| You know, we have the opportunity between now and give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| them two games to see how it goes. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| there are three remaining games after that. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| the only alternative, you know, we could have a special, pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| this for one meeting and then have a special beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| before our next city council meeting. Or we can pass this for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| two football games and have this at a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| beer board meeting. I'm not, you know, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| married to any idea, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| you know, we're running late. Anybody want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| to have any quick suggestions what they would prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Councilman Bailey. I had meant to ask Mr. Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| if that's something you'd want to go along with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I had to go along with that and work out any plans with you that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| partake it right after the event. Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I'd go for two games and we'll pick it up in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| beer board. That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Okay. I'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| to amend to approve this for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| two UT home football games and all other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| football games are postponed for consideration until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Second. Any discussion? That's close enough, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| actually it's not the football games that are postponed. It's related to the football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| Hey, Charles, that's what I liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you. Any further discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1864)|

| 0:31:36| did have a request orally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| Move to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=1904)|

| 0:33:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Have you all operated an establishment prior to this, or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Well, we had a prior beer permit, and we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| fire marshal made us put sprinkles because of dancing back in April of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| We complied with the city building. We put a special dance floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| And apparently, we got a wrong beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| And I spoke to Mr. Heskey back in July, I believe August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| and canceled our beer permit because of the dancing. And we have liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| We've been operating for about seven weeks. And we canceled beer permit to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| with the dancing in the business. And we talked to the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| ABC, the fire marshal, and we did regulations for the city business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| And we have no issues. And we're doing everything within compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| And I suppose then I have to assume that parking is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| adequate and everything. That's a very nice company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| I'm very familiar with that business. It's been a number of different establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Well, that's kind of in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Not just kind of, but it's in a very nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| It is a nice neighborhood. It just concerns me about particularly the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| and lighting. Well, you have Toddy's. And Toddy's is a big establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| And on Fridays, they're very busy. And they don't have parking. And they're on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| But they don't have a large parking lot. So people park in our lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| and around the lots. And I don't think. Well, just real often, it's been my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| observation that when dancing is included, the hours are a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| different. And my concern, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| that is the district I represent, is how this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| perhaps play out in the parking area and so on. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| simply want to make you aware that I think people will be commenting and watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| to see how successful you can be there in that environment with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| dancing and with that size parking. We've been operating for seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So we have had our neighbors behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Just a little neighborly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| advice. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Further discussion? Comments? Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| The ayes have it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| La Perigo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Cedric Courant. It's 416 West Lynch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| We're waiting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| building inspector, fire inspector, health department approval, task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| When do you plan on taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| the task force class? Well, I took it last year, October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| last year. And I've got the copy of that. I don't have it with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| right now because on the paper it was saying this evening you will not accept any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| paperwork from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Otherwise, for the visit of the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| the fire marshal, and the city building, we are under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| right now. I talked to every one of them yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| They do not want to do the visit right now because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| process of the construction. When can you bring the task force certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| into the office? Tomorrow if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Tomorrow? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| But otherwise, we look to open about three weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| the 11th of October on Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| We've got all our plans being approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| health department, all our plans being approved by the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| all our plans being approved by the city of Knoxville also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Construction plans. Councilman Pilo. Well, I'm just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| comment that I really hate to see this very nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| restaurant move out of West Knoxville and to hope you'll be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| successful in your new location because it was a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| people enjoyed very much and received high praises. Well, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| will enjoy it better because now we're going to be also open for lunch also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Lunch and dinner, which before we couldn't be open for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Only for dinner. Mark, did you make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Yes, Councilman Holquist has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I think it sounds great and I know someone who lives next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| upstairs and they're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I was going to ask you, there's a part of the plan is to put an outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| seating area that will have to be built up because of the slope of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| sidewalk and that requires separate permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| from the city. I don't believe we've approved that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Are your plans, the plans that have been approved by the city, are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| contingent on that for the restaurant to work, to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| your seating requirements or whatever? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| that hasn't been approved, I'm just wondering. Well, the outside is separate from the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| The outside, it's not for all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| The inside, we're going to have 40 seats inside, which is required by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| wine license, but also we've been talking with Madeleine and Will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| and fill up all the paperwork to go through with the patio outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| So everything's been set up. The plan's been drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| They just need to be dropped right now over it and Madeleine and Will said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| there's no problem over that. As the exception, we get to be inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| the four feet inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| There is a tree and there is a square on the tree. We get to be four feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| on the inside and there is no problem over that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| As long as we get access through the line of the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| to the rail of the restaurant for handicap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| The deck we're going to build over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| is a deck where it's not going to stay. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| take it off at any time. If we get to leave one day for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| it's something which can be taken off right away and not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| on the path of the city or anything like that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| You're welcome. Move approval pending final documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2404)|

| 0:41:54| Ms. Martin. We're waiting on approval from the building inspector and fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| I see in our packet of supplementary information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| the beer permit with dancing inspection was not approved due to a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| for sprinklers. So I guess the fire marshal will come back out and look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| and then when we receive that final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| that will all be copacetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| That's fine. That's fine. Are you in the process of putting a sprinkler system in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Yes ma'am. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Councilman Feeler. Well I just wanted to make a comment here. I'm very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| with the location of this establishment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| although I had expressed my concern about dancing being added to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| establishment, this parking lot to the contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| is quite large. It's well lighted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| I don't have the same concerns about this location. It's in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| very commercial area and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| I believe they'll be able to manage their dancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| there appropriately. Wish you luck on that though. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| So I'll make a motion that this be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Second. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2590)|

| 0:43:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2598)|

| 0:44:10| Ms. Munroy and she's got a couple of issues she wants to research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2650)|

| 0:44:19| rescheduled to the next beer board meeting as she takes a look at some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So I'd say from even reading down our list of what she has and what she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| does not have. And I'm going to make a motion that it be postponed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| Any discussion? Quick question. Is this the 99 Quick Mart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| location? Yeah. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Will this postponement also give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| the beer board chairman time to get the name down? Will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I don't know about that. Slow learner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Are we ready to vote? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| If we have something they want. They've requested a deferral until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| So moved. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2715)|

| 0:45:55| No record on one owner and three owners have not been in for processing at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| police department. Miss Mark. We're waiting on approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| for the building inspector and fire inspector. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Becker. Yeah. Since folks haven't been in for processing, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| we need to postpone this. So I'm going to make a motion to postpone until the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| beer board meeting. I'll second it because that's in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| and I was very concerned about mislocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| on a number of counts. Just to be clear, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| owners and managers need to come into the police department and I guess it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Mr. Husky get fingerprinted and get the records checked, right? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Right. Yeah. We have other three partners out of town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| He did that last week, so. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Sir, you're not open yet, are you? Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| It's an empty building and a brand new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2807)|

| 0:47:23| regarding the Greek fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| No record. Files complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Did I hear Mr. Nasios has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| record or no applicable record? Actually, Mr. Nasios is to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| for that. He brought that to our attention a couple of years ago when everybody used to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| no applicable record even when someone had no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| He pointed that out as a member of the bar that he didn't want somebody to think he had a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| out there that was not applicable. Mr. Huskin, I worked that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| I remember that. Mr. Nasios is my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| Be kind to him. Thank you. As an added bonus, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| not volunteered to serve food this year, so the health department won't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| to be there. Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2891)|

| 0:48:19| Sunrise Supermarket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2899)|
| 0:48:39| I suppose one could make a motion to move to the end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| but that would be a little silly. I'm going to move we just postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| to the next beer board meeting. Well, I would second that. I've heard nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| from these folks, although I'm very aware that they are planning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| open in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2936)|

| 0:49:04| The ayes have it. Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| And now the fun begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Hold it. Wanda's got to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| We had put on the addendum the Tomo Japanese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Restaurant, but they brought in the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| before tonight and we released the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And Waukee Fresh Asian Diner on Merchants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| same circumstances. They met the requirements and we released the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Previously presented for beer board consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| farm at 1204 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| We granted extensions at the July 15th and August 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| meetings, and they still need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Do we have an idea how much more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Daniel Shu contacted me today. I think he has another one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| He was asking for an additional 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| He apologized that he couldn't make it here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| He had another meeting to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| So that would be the November beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| Is that a motion? That's a motion to move that to November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Any discussion? All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| The ayes have it. The next one is Mama Jan's at 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Market Square. They were granted an extension on August 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| and they need an additional extension and we're going for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| I'm sorry. We haven't heard anything. We would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| 28 days. Move to make a motion that we defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| this to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| How about extending it? Extend it to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| We were postponing earlier when we should defer it, so I want to say the word defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Move that we extend this deadline to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| I'll second that motion. It's corrected. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Quarry Tavern, 7125 Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| extension granted July 15th and August 26th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Are we going for 28 days? We'll go for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Move approval for an extension for 28 days to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| October beer board meeting. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| The ayes have it. Next, there is a request in the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| provided tonight from the Historic Old City District for the Old City Halloween| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Street Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| And they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| Rod Townsend, PO Box 138-37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| What do you all propose to do? Well, we'd like to hold a street party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| on October 31st, which is Halloween, from 7 to midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| We'd like to have beer sales from 7, stopping at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| We've spoken with the city. We've spoken with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| And everyone seems to be okay with the proposal. And we're here to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| the beer permit. We'd like to have two locations that serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| beer. Everyone will be carted. And wristbands will be issued to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| that's of drinking age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| It's not a permit. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| And this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| includes the closure of Central at Willow and Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| at the east end of Parking Lot to just past Barley's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Is that correct? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Ma'am? Has that been worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| We've spoken with Lieutenant Hubs at the police department, and he's sent us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| a map designating the closure locations and outlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| the police support that he felt we would need to have to conduct this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| in an orderly manner. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Let me just advise the beer board about they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| actually requesting a beer permit. The beer permit was previously issued in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| pursuant to the special event provisions in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| And they are required to provide to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| a plan for how they're going to operate a particular event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| And when they submit the plan, then that's to be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| before the beer board at the next regularly scheduled meeting. That's what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| This plan has been brought in for this event and is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| being placed on your schedule for your approval or disapproval for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| particular event. But you're not granting a beer permit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| You're just approving the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| Councilman Baker. And are we approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| a plan, or are we reviewing a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| You are reviewing a plan. It's up to you whether or not you want to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| We actually allow them to use the beer permit to execute the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Councilman Rawlings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Mr. Townsend, explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| to me in more detail how you plan to address underage drinking at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Well, we're going to have two stations set up that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| issue wristbands once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| IDs are issued. All of the beer will be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| by licensed or whatever, you know, bartenders that have been through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| program. That's pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I don't know what else we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Is there a limit on the number of beers that can be sold to an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Yes, one beer per person. That's critical because it's pretty easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| pass it off to your buddy. What about folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| leaving with open containers? We will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| off-duty police officers stationed at each of the exit points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| to control that. What about the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| over-serving and driving under the influence and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| in terms of how much you can control that? Well, each of the individuals serving the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| will be a licensed bartender. And they have experience with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and it will be subject to their determination, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| So they'll be instructed that they have the authority to cut people off if they feel like they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| over-served. Absolutely. We're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| basically establish a resurgence in the old city. And this is an event that we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| we could kick things off. And so we want it to run smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| and for everybody to have a good time. And we're not looking to create any unnecessary problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And where are the beer sales going to be? Is this the outside Sullivan's and outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Club 106? The beer sales will be right outside. I think they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| contiguous to licensed establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3365)|
| 0:56:15| We get a motion to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| I move that the plan be approved as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| The ayes have it. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| One more thing on the addendum. We have given you a list of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| permittees who haven't paid their grocery seats tax, which means they do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| have valid current business licenses, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| a bad thing. So it's up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| to determine what you'd like to do about it. And we'll assist in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| we can. If I may advise the beer board on this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| typically what we do with respect to these is the beer board adopts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| a motion to authorize the law department to proceed with suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| and revocation proceedings. It's surprising how quickly the money comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| as that begins. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Any discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Is there anything else that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I get a motion to adjourn. It's been adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080323?start=3451)|
