| 0:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| So I'd like to make a brief announcement before we continue with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| As you all know, we have several candidates that will be coming before Council this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| and several people speaking on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| We would like to ask everyone to please be very respectful of the limited time that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| will have to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| So we're going to ask everyone to please refrain from any outbursts so they will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| the opportunity to be focused on the questions as well as the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| And we appreciate your cooperation in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| I'm now going to refer to the Law Director who will discuss the rules of the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| The mechanism for choosing a member of Council through an appointment process is laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| both in the Charter and primarily in the Ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| It takes a person that's going to have to receive six out of the eight votes to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| This will count as a term of the Council Member and upon the conclusion of tonight's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| that person will be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Now, I've been reviewing the rules that are in place and also yesterday afternoon I reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| the last meeting where an appointment occurred nine years and one month ago and learned some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=220)|
| 0:03:50| lessons from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| The rules that we have in place have yet to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| It's impossible to always predict the future and we're going to do, we're going to abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| by the rules and do the best we can in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| I would like to point out to Council that there is the potential issue of tied votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Obviously, with eight people voting there's the potential of a 4-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| I'm less concerned with that than what I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| So the rules say right now in the first round of votes any applicants, and that's applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| plural, receiving zero votes are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| Then the rule says in second and subsequent rounds the applicant singular receiving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| lowest number of votes is eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| Repeating that strictly, if there is a tie for the lowest number of votes there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| It can potentially create a log jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| For example, if two people have votes, one vote each, I see three different ways to attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=302)|
| 0:05:12| to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| One is keep going on on the rules that we have and the log jam will have to be broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=313)|
| 0:05:22| Another option is beginning in the second round because the ground rules for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| round are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| If you receive no votes, no matter the number of people receiving no votes, they're eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Then in the second round, all candidates tied for the lowest number of votes are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| However, I would like to point out, you know, lawyers are generally conservative and lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| see problems where hopefully none will ever arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| If there's a vote that is 1-1-1-4, that would eliminate four candidates all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:58| That's a big event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| Another option is a blend of what we presently have and it also takes what was used successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=364)|
| 0:06:13| nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| What it could be is the first round would remain the same, any candidates receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| zero votes are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And then in the next fill-in-the-blank number of rounds, you would proceed under the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| I suggest maybe consider five rounds where it would still be if there's a candidate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=393)|
| 0:06:41| a lower number of votes, that person would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| But if there are two or more candidates tied for last, you would keep voting for five rounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| until somebody changed, somebody on counsel changed their vote and there was one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| one candidate with the least number of votes, then that person would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| However, if we go through rounds two through six and there are no changes, the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| would be, then the rule would become candidates, plural, with the least number of votes would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=431)|
| 0:07:20| then be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| The meeting nine years and one month ago went 16 rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| Candidates or applicants were not dropped until the 11th round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Mr. Thomas, he was appointed to office at that time, so Mr. Thomas lived that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| There were 10 rounds of votes where there was little to nothing changed and there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| no candidates dropped and it was only because they got to the 11th round and there was kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| of this logjam break that it happened and as Mr. Thomas, I'm sure, can tell you, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| were really only five or six rounds where it got narrowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| It really didn't get narrowed down until that 11th round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Now, if counsel is going to, whatever they're going to consider, I'd respectfully suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| that they consider it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| No votes have been cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| All candidates have the same number of votes, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| Have the discussion, have the ground rule in place, and then begin the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| We'll open it up for counsel discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=519)|
| 0:08:49| Is counsel in agreement with the voting guidelines that our legal counsel set forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| I think our attorney has brought something to us that we really ought to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| I mean, I don't mind sitting here forever, but it does seem an oddity that the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| number of votes gets dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| The first round says applicants and the second round says applicant and I really think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| should consider out of what could be a very arduous experience, and some people might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=569)|
| 0:09:40| think not fair, that we might want to modify this, that there would be a number after five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| rounds, six rounds, some number of rounds where if it's tied, people with the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=588)|
| 0:09:57| number are dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I just think that's something we should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| I wanted to start the discussion because you asked for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| I think we owe it to folks to discuss this because it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| I would like to point out this is, I conferred with an attorney who was formerly in the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I also conferred with the City Law Director and the Deputy City Law Director in trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| to find something that was equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you, Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| I have gone back and forth since this afternoon thinking about whether we should make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| tonight or not and running scenarios through my head in which I'm wishing I could plug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| things in a supercomputer to try to figure out the pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| And for me, kind of where I landed was just thinking, you know, I have suggestions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=653)|
| 0:11:03| ways to improve this moving forward beyond thinking about this tiebreaker situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| And I think similar to our conversation earlier when deciding how this meeting would move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| forward, that the best thing would be to leave the process we have currently in place and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| then to review it afterwards when we can give the public more notice and we can have a collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| effort to look through and imagine all of the scenarios before we make the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I just want to make sure I'm clear with what the rule would be then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| So if we stick with the rules as they are now, if in the second round you had multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| parties with one vote, all of them would be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| No, as the rules are right now, if you have multiple parties in any round from the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| round on with the lowest number of votes, everybody keeps going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| It's only when...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| It's only when they have zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| No, it's when one candidate has the fewest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| If you have two candidates with two votes, you vote again with those two candidates still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| in the running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Okay, so if there's a tie, then those two, three, however many it would be, would move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| on to the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| And that's what's currently in the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| That's what's currently in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| If you have three candidates, for sake of argument, that are tied, they still are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| it until there is one candidate with the fewest number of votes before anyone gets eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Council Member Testimone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| I just echo that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Your mic's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| I would just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| I'm probably leaning against the blackboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I would just echo what Councilwoman Fugate said in the sense that I feel like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| obviously, you know, there is a process that's been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| And I think that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| I feel like we've got to have a mechanism in place that is a tiebreaker of some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| or that allows us to continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| You know, everything that I'm aware of or processes that you look at that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| have some type of similar process, there's always something in place that enables it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| to, you know, make a call and to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| And so I feel like, you know, it's a fair process to consider something if we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| multiple rounds and there's no give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| There's got to be something that can allow us and enable us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=841)|
| 0:14:13| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I agree that I can imagine this going on for a long time with one vote, two votes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| a lot of ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| So I don't know if we want to make it maybe three rounds and then drop the tie at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=865)|
| 0:14:35| bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| That's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I push my light to say exactly what Councilwoman Singh said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| She's reading my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| I think if I'm trying to play it out in my head, if we call out our votes and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| ties of, you know, three all tied at one, and then you vote again and it stays that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| way, and then you vote again and it stays that way, I think it might matter how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| people are in at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Anybody want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I mean, are we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| It depends on if we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| We're starting with seven, and it depends on if we're down to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| I guess at some point we're up to six for somebody and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Just so we have something to vote up or down, I make a motion that after five rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| after five rounds of tied, lowest number tied, not second or third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=943)|
| 0:15:52| I mean, you know, you could have two people tied and then for the lowest number, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| the lowest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Let me restate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| If at the end of five rounds of voting, there is a tie with individuals that had the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=961)|
| 0:16:13| number of votes, that we then, those individuals drop the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=973)|
| 0:16:24| And that's, I guess I'm going with kind of a hybrid number, sort of like number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=984)|
| 0:16:36| but it would be at the end of the fifth round for the sake of argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| If it dies for lack of second, it dies, but there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I have a question about that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| So would it be, let's say we've gone five rounds and there have been three people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| What if they're different people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| It's not the same three people each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Trying to get it complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Well, I think the spirit of it was that the, say it's beginning of round two, the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:14| with the lowest number of votes gets eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:23| It says applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| So in the first round, if five people or six people or one person gets zero votes, they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| So in the beginning, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| It's only, there could be a lot of people tied with a zero, is my point, in the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| That's the only thing I was trying to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Councilmember Testament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So to that point, and to clarify what Councilwoman Singh, Councilwoman Fugitt are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| so I would say, I mean, I would second that motion to clarify that if five rounds are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:10| and the same people, then the lowest vote getters would then at that point be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| And I think, Attorney Frost, if I read the rules correctly, anyone with zero is automatically eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Zero votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| So there wouldn't be a tie for zero, zero are automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| The first round, those receiving zero votes are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| So I would say five rounds of consistent people, consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| I would accept your amendment to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Yeah, it's what we're trying to do here, I think, is look at two different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| And one scenario is theoretically, you know, under the rules as they are, this vote theoretically could go on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| There would be no tiebreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Is that going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| But Attorney Frost is trying to figure out a way, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| where there's kind of a hybrid mechanism where you have a method for breaking the tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| but it is not so abrupt that people feel like it's done too quickly or people don't have multiple votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| council people don't have time to possibly adjust or change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| So this sounds like a compromise between kind of two positions that we could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Like I said, what I have as number two in the e-mail to you all is a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| It's the first five rounds are what's presently on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Then after that passes, it gets back to how things were handled nine years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| where they started, they had a process in place where after the tenth round, they started dropping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| I think, you know, as Council Member Thomas said, the possibility of eliminating people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| a number of people in the second round, might seem abrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I'd point out in reviewing the meeting nine years ago, Mr. Thomas received two votes at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| and later came on to obviously get six votes and win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| But whatever Council decides, everybody wants a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| I mean, as Council Member Singh pointed out, there are so many different permutations that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| and woulda, coulda, shouldas that you can play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| It's just the, you know, it's the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| We do the best that we can do, and I know Council wants a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Council Member Fugate, is your motion number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| And is the second Council person testament number two as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Then I call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I'd like to point out it takes six votes, or six in the affirmative, six of the eight of you all to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:34| Otherwise, we use the rule that's presently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I'm repeating the motion with the amendment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Well, it's really number two, which is at the end of five rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| if there are people tied at the lowest number, they would be dropped after five rounds of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1313)|
| 0:22:04| Let me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| The first round is if one or more candidates receive zero votes, those candidates are dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:16| Then we have the next five rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| If there's a tie, then a candidate is dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Let's just, for sake of argument, in the third round, there is one candidate with one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| That candidate will be dropped at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| But for sake of argument, we have two candidates that each have one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and that stays the same through those five rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Then when we get to round seven, if there's a tie for the least number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| the candidates in the tie are then dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Well, I just wanted to add in that I do think it's important to include the clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| that Councilwoman Singh included, because there could be someone who received, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| three votes consistently, and then the fifth round, they're at the bottom with one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| along with a couple other people, and would they still be dropped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Or is it only the individuals who've gone through five rounds of having the lowest vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| Could you state that again, please, Council Member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| We change our minds between two and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| So after five rounds of voting, would we drop all candidates who received that lowest number of vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| five consecutive times, or if at one point they got more votes, but then the next round they got less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| In round six, if there's a tie at the bottom, it's only in round six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| If there's a tie at the bottom, are they dropped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Both candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Both candidates, or three candidates, or however many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Right. Is it according to when they show up at the bottom, or how many times they showed up at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| It's beginning in the sixth round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| If there is a tie, whoever is at the bottom in the sixth round is eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| If there's a tie in the bottom of the seventh round, those tied are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| This is a little arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Sorry, that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I thought when Councilwoman Testerman clarified Puget's motion, I thought, and maybe this will clarify Councilwoman Parker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:59| I thought that what we were saying is when you have five in a row that don't change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:09| In other words, you're voting along, and three people are at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Then the next time, two people are at one, and then that repeats five consistent times, then it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| To me, that is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Nothing is going to change until those two people drop off, because five times in a row we made those people the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| But if something happens three times in a row, then somebody changes, then that starts your string of five again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| I don't believe this is even necessarily going to happen, but I feel like it gives a fair layout of an opportunity for things to progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:53| and somebody to look at the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Like, we've done this five times in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| It's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| It's a stalemate at that point for that five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And then I will only tack on to that by saying I did also watch the meeting from Mr. Thomas way back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| and that was painful, those first maybe 20 rounds of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| It never changed, really, so it was pointless to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| To clarify, I thought that Councilwoman Testerman was clarifying Fugate to say what I just said, if it made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:35| So just so the audience is aware of the conversation that we're having and that there's no miscommunication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| our law director reviewed the previous meeting, reviewed the guidance that Council has in their ruling and consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:55| Today, he contacted each Councilmember individually and had a discussion with us individually regarding what we're discussing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| which is to amend and adopt the new rules that we're discussing now as far as the rounds when people would start dropping out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| if there is a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| So I wanted to be very clear that this is a discussion, this is a very new discussion that just presented itself today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| So you can follow us from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I was just going to say, Councilwoman Ryder, that that is exactly what I intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| and what I was working to clarify, that five rounds that are consistently the same would be my amendment to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| So I want to ask a question because I do want to acknowledge that Councilmember Parker made an excellent observation that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:51| as I just mentioned, this new conversation came about this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| The candidates that will be coming before us were not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| I'd now like to ask our legal counsel, how did we get to a decision at the last meeting that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:11| How did we get to Councilmember Thomas being the successful candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| Well, nine years ago, there were really very few rules other than someone had to get six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:27| And after ten rounds of stalemate voting where no one received six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| they had a rule where people at the bottom started getting eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| And, you know, I discussed that in a good conversation with Councilmember Thomas about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| And, I mean, he said there were essentially six votes, or excuse me, six rounds of voting where it actually got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| There were ten rounds of stagnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| No one received six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| A few votes changed here and there, but it didn't get to the goal that's required of six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Just to get back to Councilmember Parker's arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| how did you come up last time with ten votes and this time ten rounds and this time five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Is there any difference in reasoning or that it was done in six mainly before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Well, I mean, it was actually the period of time when I was off counsel and before representing counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Swanson was there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I was not there at the time, but for whatever reason at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| they had the change in the rules that went into effect in the eleventh round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| So I just, you know, I just threw out, for sake of argument, five rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| I mean, you all could do it two rounds, four rounds, five rounds, ten rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| It was just for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| We're just agreeing beforehand rather than at five or at ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| So let me clarify one last time because I think Councilman Roberta actually called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| So I think what I'd like to propose is that after five rounds of the same people being on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:35| lowest number, they begin to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| I would second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And by drop off, you mean that those that were tied would be eliminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Those that were tied are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Which is what Ms. Testerman, I think, had agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I'm just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| But that's after the first round with the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| The first round stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| And after that, this is trying to put in the tiebreaker mechanism ahead of the voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| which did not happen nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| That's my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Well, we have a second by Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Councilmember Parker, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Let me ask clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| So round six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Please don't make me clarify again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Round six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| We were going, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Two people are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| And then in round seven, we have two more people tied at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Five more rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| They have to be tied at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| That's what I'm sensing the consensus that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| That's how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Is everyone clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Would you like to repeat that so we can vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Will, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| The motion was to, after five rounds of the same people being at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| tied for the bottom, the lowest vote count, that they would be eliminated from the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| So that's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1941)|

| 0:32:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| And so, candidates, that will be the rules of voting in this election this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:44| So now we will have a drawing of the candidate names by the city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Each candidate's name has been placed in this bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| As he pulls a name, he will read the name of the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| That will be the order in which candidates will speak and which their supporters will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=1980)|

| 0:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| At this time, we will have candidate speeches in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| The first candidate will be David Alex Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:29| Mr. Hayes, you'll have three minutes for your opening speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| If you would please watch the monitor in front of you, and I will alert you when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| 20 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| My name is David Hayes, and I firmly believe in making sure Knoxville works for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| its people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| And when y'all make y'all's decision tonight, I hope y'all consider a few things, first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| of which would be my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| I lived in District 1 the entire time I've been in Knoxville, and for most of that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| I've been an activist, meaning I've been in the work of empowering residents and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| And for the past four years, I've consistently been attending city council meetings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| have been building a grasp of the budget process, the agenda, and different processes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| city council in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| And right now, I am fully prepared and ready to transition from being an activist to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| a city council person, transitioning from being solely in the community doing work to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| also governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And I am ready for the responsibility and accountability that comes with this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| The second thing I'd like to bring up is I believe I'm the people's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I have over 720 petition signatures represented right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| And so yes, we had over 10,000 votes across the city, and District 1 voted for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| The majority of District 1 voted for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| And they didn't vote for me because I was perceived to be a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| They didn't vote for me to vote just against Councilwoman Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| They voted for me because they voted for David Hayes, because they voted and believed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| a Knoxville for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| And they believed in our platform, and they believed in the things we was fighting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| And lastly, I believe that I will be a viable addition to this council, because as we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| know, there is a gap between the community and the city, and I want to bridge that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| And I understand that the root causes of a lot of the tensions and dissent that we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| is a lack of information and communication in the community, a lack of community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| and processes, and a lack of trust that voices are heard and will be reflected in the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| of policy and processes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| So I'm ready to work to resolve these issues and work to bridge those gaps so we can create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| a dynamic when we see a lot of activists, a lot of community members coming to City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| It's not just assume they're going to be against something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Let's create a dynamic when we see large groups of people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We can assume they're here to support what we're doing, because they know what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| They're informed, and they see that they're benefiting from what the city is doing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| So lastly, I believe after meeting with all of you all and talking to all of you, I fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| believe that I can work effectively with every single individual that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| I know we don't agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| I know none of you agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| But I know if we can come together and assume best intentions, commit to working to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| other, make efforts to find a common ground between us, and work collectively on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| when we can, I believe that we can work together and create a city that actually begins to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| work for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| And just so we're clear as far as just the community support, I would like for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| people who came to support me to stand in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| This is what our movement for a Knoxville for All looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| I hope you join us and choose me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:50| candidate should speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| The candidates are speaking first, and then the supporters will come after all the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| The candidates speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Will's handing out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Mr. Ammiel, you'll have three minutes for your speech, if you'd like to start, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| The role of council member blends servant and leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| One must possess the humility to approach every person and issue with an open mind and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| heart of compassion, the confidence to choose boldly and wisely in the best interest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| the city and her citizens, and the fortitude to weather criticism and defend one's decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| In choosing this appointee, it is tempting to look to past elections for answers, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| the data provides only one conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Voters overwhelmingly chose Stephanie Welch as first district council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Stephanie is best described as intelligent, involved, accessible, approachable, unflappable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| and fair-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Only someone who shares these traits will be able to fill her shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| The voice of the people should also be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| In choosing how best to hear this voice, I decided that the hard work of going door-to-door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| was the best route for me to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| This path allowed me to have dozens of conversations with verifiable residents of the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I spoke with 125 people, and only five declined to sign my petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| This means 96% of them were comfortable enough to sign on as supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| My conversations with constituents were enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2372)|

| 0:39:41| In Old Sevier, I hearkened to the delicate balance between economic development and neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Across the river in Fort Sanders, I heard demands for litter cleanup and better access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=2387)|

| 1:07:24| And Ben Ream, we've heard a little bit from Pastor about Ben's acumen, Ben's persistence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| and professionalism and his preparedness, and I've got to tell you, he is a punctual guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| He's always spot on. He's always considerate. Prepared, in terms of the notes he handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| out, it's not just a one-time thing that Ben's going to do. Ben's always a well-oiled machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| and he's going to work well with your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| But I just wanted to speak real quick on three things for Ben that really impressed me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| how I actually got to meet Ben. I want to talk a little bit about his local flair, his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| business acumen, and then his fitness as well. So for local flair, I met Ben at one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| very first Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood Association meetings. That's where I live. And the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| was just getting started. There are 30 or 40 people there, and you know how you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| a lot of different people that speak during a meeting. I was with my little group of neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| and there's somebody over here who kind of had a couple good points, a couple good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| a distinct voice, and that was Ben. But I never put the name with a face until two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| three meetings later, because as meetings break, people kind of go different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| He was always spot on. He was always consistent. He was always focused on what's best for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| organization, you know, the new Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood Association that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| getting formed. So very, very ingrained in South Knoxville and what's best for the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| community. And that's really why I came here tonight to speak, because he's just a rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| solid member of that organization. His wife, Heather, wasn't back here until before I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| sat close to those two. And they're just a great group of folks, you know, Heather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| and Ben. So there's a lot of synergies there, and they're very supportive of one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| and very plugged in and connected. So if you want plugged in folks in the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| which I know you all seem very considerate and consistent, so he would be a great addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| to that team. 34 seconds. So second with business as it relates to Ben, he's able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| with all levels of executives and worker bees as well. So he's well versed with sea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| level business topics in terms of finance and marketing and sales and employee relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| So as the council looks to grow, you know, with the city that's growing, Ben would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| a great fit because of the business. Five seconds. He is a ninja monkey, I guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=4203)|

| 1:27:22| Thank you. Thank you, Council Members and Vice Mayor and everybody for being here. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| is really encouraging for the civic society here in Knoxville. So I'm here to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| Rebecca Parr for Councilwoman, and I say that I have known Rebecca for about two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| and when I first met Rebecca, I was really struck by her passion and compassion for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| and issues in South Knoxville. She's very driven, and she, with her sister, and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:57| brother, started up a very small street outreach nonprofit here in Knoxville called Next Step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5277)|

| 1:28:16| persons and persons who use drugs and also need help. I work in addiction medicine, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| over the last year, I've worked very closely with Rebecca on these issues, and she's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:31| convener. She's been a convener of multiple populations to try to work on change. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:40| things that she did is she worked very closely with Montgomery Village and conducted a listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| session, and I will say that she's a very good listener. She tries to take people's considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| and thoughts into heart, and with that, helped move that community to work on dialogue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5332)|
| 1:29:07| empowerment. I'll say that over the last year of working with Rebecca, I've found that she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:15| a very good listener. I've also found that in addition to her qualities of being a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| convener, as well as compassionate and passionate about what she does and for these underserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| populations, she's also a leader. I really respect that in her, and I strongly encourage you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| consider her for the next position. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5377)|

| 1:30:03| Okay. I think I won't use all of it, but that's great. Again, my name is David Bolt. I've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| and have been an owner of some commercial property in Vestal for about 10 years. I first met Rebecca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:15| Parr when she was running for office, and when she came to my office, we spent about an hour talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| and I was very, very impressed with her just ability to care and her compassion for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| I said to her as we were leaving that, I'm not sure you're a politician, and what I learned about her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:41| working with her the last three years is that she has been incredibly good at building community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| incredibly good at being inclusive, very good at building relationships, and I think that she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:56| done a very good job of that. Inclusive sort of government is something that would be very much valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| here in the city. She asked me to come to the swearing-in of the new mayor, which I was a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:10| reluctant to do, but I came, and I was really glad I did. The message that came from that inauguration was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:19| one of inclusion, which, again, I think is very, very important for where we are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| State of affairs right now, particularly nationally, but it was just very encouraging to see that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| being carried at that event, and what I noticed at that event is that just so many people were coming up to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| and thanking her for things she had done, and it was just very clear to me that she was very well respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| in the community and very well known in the community, and I think she'd make a very fine commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| I'll give you all an extra minute to get out here early. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5516)|

| 1:32:27| Well, I'll have to say I'm blown away by all of the support here tonight. It's an incredibly encouraging thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| for our city to see this slate of candidates and the passionate support for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5553)|

| 1:33:05| I'm here to ask your support today for Tommy Smith to fill the city council seat that's being vacated by Stephanie Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| which is a big seat to fill. She's done an extraordinary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| I'm really proud to be a Knoxvillian, and I think by many traditional metrics, Knoxville's thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| It's an exciting place to be, and I think there's an extraordinary quality of life to be had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| and increasing economic prosperity and opportunities. It's really breathtaking to see how it's transformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| over the past 20 years, which if you were down here on a Thursday night 20 years ago, you may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| able to choose between two or three restaurants to eat at, and there would be virtually no activity on the streets at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:56| So that transformation's been exciting, but there's a lot left to be done, and I think the increasingly fertile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:07| environment for entrepreneurship is something that we need to make sure is available to all in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| and that we see this prosperity continue to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| That's why I support Tommy. I think he represents the future of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| He and his wife, Jamie, in many ways have made the ultimate investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| They're raising three children, and I see on a daily basis their commitment to a community that's going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| their children to thrive and prosper as they grow older and reach to achieve their dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| Tommy came to me very early on to discuss his interest in being on city council and to share his vision for the city's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| We spent several hours on a Sunday walking through South Knoxville, and he shared so many ideas and his passion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| commitment, and it really convinced me beyond all shadow of a doubt that Tommy was the best candidate for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| position, and I ask you to support him in your vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5703)|

| 1:35:24| You have three minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| If I didn't know you better, I'd ask, are you sure you still want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| These guys work really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5734)|

| 1:35:55| So much that we've lived in South Knoxville since 2006, except for one year where we had this lapse in judgment and we moved away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5755)|
| 1:36:04| And after one year, my husband and I looked at each other and said, hey, I love you, honey, but I miss my South Knoxville friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| I miss being able to put on a pair of tennis shoes and walk out the front door and get to Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| I miss having this close-knit community that's so closely connected to the larger city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| So that describes my neighborhood, that describes several other neighborhoods in South Knoxville, it also describes Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| Very strong communities that need that connection to the larger city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| And you kind of think about that connection, how do people get news, how do people get their information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Some people like to go to a public forum, some people listen to the radio, some people listen to their neighbors, which can be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| But at any rate, one of those biggest points of connection is that city council member that's there to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:55| And I think that person is Tommy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| So I ask, when you consider a person for a position, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| First you look at their resume, then you meet them, then you watch what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| And then you measure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| He's got several years of experience at a PR firm as the VP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| He, in that position, deals with a lot of complex issues on a large scale and on a small scale, just like you all do every day as a city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| So that resume is a big gold star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| But then let's meet Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| And then the other big part of that connection is the ability to listen, which is not always easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| Tommy's been involved with the school since before his kids were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| And now he and Jamie invented a fundraiser to make money for the playground called Petal Jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| And then you watch what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| So in our close-knit neighborhood where we all email each other and talk about issues, he knows I'm an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| Hey, Robin, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| And I said, oh, you want to talk to me about what I'm going to say about you tomorrow, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=5890)|

| 1:40:48| So we're not really going to stray too far from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| So each candidate will have the same opportunity to answer the same series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| Members of council, if I can direct your question to the packet of questions in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| You'll notice that there is a sheet for each candidate which allows you to be able to take individual notes per candidate front and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| Candidates will be allowed two minutes per response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| There is a total of ten questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Council may ask follow-up questions of the candidates as they deem necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Once the candidate has answered sufficiently all of the ten questions and any follow-up questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| we will call for the next candidate to come into the room to proceed with their interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| I also want to acknowledge that Mayor Kincannon actually brought a cake for the council members and the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| We want to actually acknowledge that she did that and that she's thinking about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| I also want to take this opportunity to thank council for your patience and your diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| especially Council Member Ryder who has to be in Georgia at what time in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| At 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6130)|

| 1:42:21| Anybody who wants to volunteer to drive, you go with me right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6141)|

| 1:42:31| With that said, I think all candidates are now out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:49| Good evening, Mr. Hayes. I'll be asking your questions. If you need me to repeat, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:56| District representatives on City Council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| Like I said before, I believe there's a gap between the city and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Oftentimes when we see major initiatives being done, you see a lot of resistance in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| Like I said before, a lot of that's resulting from lack of information, lack of communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| lack of engagement in the process, and lack of faith that the voice is going to be heard and reflected in the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| I think it's important to bring all people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| Like our slogan says, and Platform is, knocks over all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| In order for a city to work well for everybody, we've got to be able to bring all those voices in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| I believe I'm well equipped to be the person to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| Council Member Welch announced her intent to resign on December 9, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| District representatives on City Council are expected to be accessible and responsive to their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| Please detail ways you personally have reached out or made yourself available for District 1 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| and neighborhood associations since Council Member Welch's announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| I had the opportunity to be campaigning for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| I've been advertising different places throughout the city, but especially South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| I've been to probably a majority of the neighborhood associations and Knoxville Soup and the Business Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| Continuing to have a presence at those things, continuing to have a presence at meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| like the Chapman Highway meetings, where folks got a chance to give input on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| Having a presence there, but also understanding this is work we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| Having an open door to the community is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| You've got to make the effort to go out and reach people, so I'm committed to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| Renters represent the majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| In your role as a member of Council, how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities of District 1 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| who are renters or houseless are reflected in the policies and spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:16| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| Honestly, on the street in South Knoxville, I spend most of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| I've already had a couple of friends who have been pushed out because of rising increases, so this is something that's important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| But again, I think it's important to make voices heard and it's important to prioritize policies and things that will actually help the residents and help the renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| A lot of things don't actually center the needs of renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| I know a lot of folks in the South Haven neighborhood, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| You talk to neighborhood associations and lots of good folks and folks around there, you'll hear all this love for the Iams Nature Center and the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| But if you talk to renters, you talk to people who don't really have a voice in these processes, they'll be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| what's up with all these bike trails? I can barely afford to pay my rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| I don't have the resources for my life, but yet we're seeing all this investment and things that aren't even meant for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| I'm not against urban wilderness, but it's clear that there's a tradition and history of leaving these voices out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| And we've got to keep them in and we've got to be intentional about making sure whatever policies we put forth, whatever investments we put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| we know for sure that it's going to be directly benefiting renters and working class residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| I'm going to move on to represent varied viewpoints that may not be in line with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people who you have views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| It's hard to think about this because I feel like it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:58| I thought my time didn't start until I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:06| I feel like this happens so often, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| Thinking of one particular incident, I mean, in most struggles, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| So as a lot of you all know, I've worked a lot in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| fighting back against the school to prison pipeline, stop school push out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| There's a variety of different voices as far as needs and priorities that folks had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| And just about every single group I've been in, working the community defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| working with families who are going through the incarceration system and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| It's important to stand by your principles, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| Regardless of how much pressure there is, I'm not going to make decisions that's going to negatively impact working class people and poor people and people of color in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| I don't care how popular it is. If it's going to hurt our people, I'm not going to go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| But at the same time, I am still committed to working with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| And I have a lot of knowledge and experience in various things as far as getting together, circling around and being like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| we don't all agree on everything, but what is that common ground and how can we focus on the common ground to commit to action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:21| Thank you. Since diversity is a valuable thing on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| please share with us what perspective or experience you possess that is not already represented on this current city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| Wow. I kind of just want to send you all a picture of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| I mean, I think it is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| I think one thing about this campaign was when I was campaigning and organizing and looking at especially black youth and youth of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| especially black youth, you know, when I was saying I'm ready to be on city council, you know, and they'll be like, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| City council? Just black people on city council? I was like, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| And I was like, you know, I'm a black person of color, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| A lot of folks don't know that. And I think it's something special about having a more, you know, I think especially for our young boys, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| having a black male presenting model is important. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| So we lack that right now. So I think the diversity is not just in, you know, how I look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| Yes, I'm black. Most of you. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| Diversity experiences, diversity age. I saw the folks speaking for me. You know, we have a lot of young folks in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| We have all ages. We have teenagers all the way up to, you know, folks up in their 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| But people, young folks, millennials don't really have a voice. So I look forward to bringing forth a voice that represents more than just myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| That is representing a movement that is firm in the values of making sure the city works to benefit all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| And that is uplifting the voice of marginalized people and young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Can you repeat that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| Yes. So land use, so these are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:30| And this is something I talked about before where you look at the root cause of a lot of dissensions when it comes to land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| It's because of the things I mentioned earlier with the lack of communication, lack of engagement, lack of trust that I believe I'm positioned to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| I think there's an understanding that we're never going to reach a decision that everybody 100% is going to be okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| And I think that's fine. I think that's real and we have to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| But I still think it's important to have somebody standing firm on the values of, okay, how is this land being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| How is it benefiting the community around it? Is it prioritizing the residents or is it prioritizing the developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| Is it prioritizing the people who currently live there or the wealthier residents that people are trying to get to move in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| All those things I'm going to analyze and make sure that the folks are, whatever decisions and changes being done is actually benefiting the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| But the most important thing is making sure there's communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| Because we can come up with the best idea, but if people in the community don't really have a voice in it, we're going to see resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| So the most important thing is making sure when we change land use things that we have varying and different tactics to reach out to people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| such as Councilperson Roberto's blog, such as taking advantage of the local news, social media, and all the sort of tactics that we can use to make sure to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:49| So we're not facing resistance when we change the use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| What should change and what should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| Public safety is crucially important to me, but I think we should look at it from a more holistic point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| Public safety means safety from domestic violence, safety from sexual violence, safety from domestic violence, safety from police violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| Because I think as somebody who's faced police brutality, as somebody who's almost been killed by KPD, I know that's a hyperbole but unfortunately it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| As somebody who knows so many other people in the community who've had negative run-ins in the community, and as somebody who knows many people who've been in situations of crisis, it had nobody else to call but the police, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:43| So I understand the context of what we're living in, but I think in order to increase public safety, we've got to do something about poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| Because no matter where you look across the globe, where you see poverty, you see high crime, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| You see people living in more unsafe conditions, so we've got to address the root cause, which is addressing poverty, bringing voices in, and changing the way we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:07| I think we need to shift our priorities and the budget and what we invest in to make sure that we are addressing this high poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:16| I believe over a quarter of people in Knoxville, over 42% of black people, you're going to have crime if you have that poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| Police alone do not solve that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| So we need actual investment in public safety and not just investment in criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| And before giving more resources to the police, although I do think body cams is necessary and we need to have a good policy with that, they have to answer for their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:40| They've been in the news and scandals this whole past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| And until PARC is empowered to make the decisions to discipline officers, to change the budget, to change the policies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| Until we can actually start to build trust, because trust goes both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| In order to have trust, we've got to have power in the community side to effect changes in the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| So I want to see those things done, and I fully support public safety in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Homelessness, poverty, low wages, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| I think as a city, that is our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| If we want the city to work well for all people, we've got to understand what people are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| Poverty and inequality is hurting our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| We have growing poverty and growing inequality that is leading into other issues like policing and criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| So we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| And we're going to community organizations, having more intention about funding affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| doing what we can to look for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| And I know a lot of you all are passionate about this, too, as far as understanding that we need to build the revenue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| We have revenue going away, we have the halls income tax within two years is going to be completely away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| So we need to be looking at a diversity of tactics to raise revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| I think it's also smart economic growth, where we're seeing local Knoxvillians have a part in the economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| Yeah, and I think the city can just do so much in making sure that we're funding social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| and also training people for jobs, making sure that we're creating a safe space for unions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| and making sure that we can revitalize the working class neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| that have been underdeveloped and disinvested and making sure they're actually putting investment in those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| so those people can be part of the economic growth and they can stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| And then we can see our communities actually start to build some wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| As a member of city council, what role do you believe you should play in helping our city achieve racial equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| and address lingering historic disparities that have resulted in a 42 percent poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| Yeah, I mean, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| I think we all have to also acknowledge there is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| You have to acknowledge that, you know, there's a lot of talk about equity within the city, but we've got to unpack what equity means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| Understand, like the question says, it's historical injustices that's led to the situations we are in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| Right. So we have responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| That's not what that's not what we do in the face of these injustices in the face of these inequities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Right. We have to understand that some areas and some communities need more investment than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| South Knoxville has a lot of working class neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| There's also some middle class and upper class neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| We need to understand that we can't just prioritize the middle class and upper class neighborhoods no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| How many steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| How many steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| What three steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Three steps. What a number. To make sure our city is on firm financial footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| I mean, I think I'm very passionate about making sure the budget is reflective of our morals and our values in the city and that it's actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| reflective of the values that we have as a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| So I believe looking at our budget and making sure we're spending in equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| But like I said earlier, prioritizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| We need to start prioritizing more word of revenue source is going to come from diversity of tactics in order in order to increase revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| So I think, you know, more investigation on that is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| And what's another what's what's another step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| Well, OK, another step that stay on message, making sure that we are in communication because there's so there's so many brilliant people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| There's so many brilliant people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| There is it's not just people within the city who have all this knowledge about how to run a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| There is so there's this brilliance and genius in the community. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| Lots of there's a wealth of knowledge to gain, not just from people within the city, but also from people within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| The speeches are the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| All right. Thank you. Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:24| Are there any follow up questions for Mr. Hayes from any council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| I have a follow up question, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| Would you seek election of this seat in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| That is such a good question. I think the term's been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| I'll answer no to that would be, you know, just a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| Somebody just want to sit in the seat just for a little bit of time and not really invest much in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| I think it's good for you all to know that to know that, you know, regardless of what happens tonight, I want to build a relationship with all you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| You know, I see myself as, you know, working with you on some capacity and a teacher regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| So I want to start building that relationship with you all now. And I would love to do that as a city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| But, you know, whatever way is going to happen is going to happen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:50| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Good evening, Mr. Ream. I'll be asking the questions. If you need me to repeat a question, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7196)|
| 2:00:04| District representatives on city council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| At its heart, I think an advocate is somebody who's able to listen and understand and put themselves in the shoes of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:22| An advocate is somebody who can hear the complaints or the concerns of community and be able to relay those in an effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| An advocate is somebody who, at their core, wants to understand the root of an issue unbound by whatever preconceived notions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| It is the neutrality of somebody that allows them to be an effective advocate in a representative role because the views you are presenting may not be your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:49| No matter who you are or what you look like, there's going to be people in your district that look different and think different from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| But their views are no less important than your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| You have to be able to hear them, to weigh facts, and to be able to represent those based on your previous experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| If I can put this in a personal way, I used to work for a furniture store in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| If any of you are familiar with Atlanta, that store was located in Norcross, which is essentially the U.N. of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| On every weekend, we would see people with income levels that could barely afford a couch to people who could spend tens of thousands of dollars without thinking a second French.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:24| We also saw people from every demographic that you could imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| People from just down the street or for people who have come from continents all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| And you had to be able to effectively interact with all of them in order to accommodate their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| Not to sell them something they didn't need, but to accommodate what it was that was necessary to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| This is a skill that I learned in the field and I was able to practice to be successful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| It's a role that I've continued on in my community advocacy and in my support for various projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| like the BMX park over at South Doyle Middle School, that were important to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| And it would be something I'd be able to carry on effectively as a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| Council Member Welch announced her intent to resign on December 9, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| District representatives on City Council are expected to be accessible and responsive to their district, as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| Please detail ways you personally have reached out to or made yourself available for District 1 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| and neighborhood associations since Council Member Welch's announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| Well, accessible is one of the ways I described, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| I promise I didn't write that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| I was responsive to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| I attended my own neighborhood association meeting, but I actually did not go to a lot of the other neighborhood association meetings as a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| I've interacted with them in the past with regularity, but it was not a priority for me in this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| I wanted to reach the people that would not be accessible during the normal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| which is why I went door to door in every single neighborhood in the 1st District, not just South Knoxville, but also in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| It allowed me to come across people who wouldn't have a voice in any other way, who don't regularly participate in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| and to learn things that were important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| Neighborhood associations are incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| I helped reconstitute mine when we moved to the area because it didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| But they're not the only means of communicating with the public, and being able to reach not only those people within neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| but those people who are in the community is important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| I got to knock on doors as part of political campaigns over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| and it was an eye-opening experience as to how appreciative people were just to be able to talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| and to find out what was important to you, and to be able to tell you their own concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| So this effort was hugely impactful for me in terms of how I wanted to represent the District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| There were a number of things that went out the door when I was able to hear the concerns that came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| One that comes to mind is city-sponsored composting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| This is not something that my own experiences would have led me to, but it's something I heard from, surprisingly, more than one resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| It's clearly something that would be beneficial to the 1st District, and it's maybe a relatively minor thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| but there's so many others out there like it that I wouldn't have been exposed to had I not undertaken that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| Renters represent the majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| In your role as a member of council, how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities of District 1 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| who are renters or houseless are reflected in the policies and spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| The district that I visited the most that had the most surprising results for me, not that I visited the most, was Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:56| Fort Sanders is comprised almost entirely of renters, at least in its district, in the people I spoke to, because they're students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:03| They're people who are living there temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| If you look at the voting precinct data for Fort Sanders, a lot of times it was lower than in comparative precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:15| The people there expressed to me more than once, I think I must have heard a dozen times, oh, I'm just a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| A student is a renter, a student has a voice, and whether you're in this district for a month or a year or ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| you're, oh, my time's not rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| Whether you're in the district for a short time or a long time, your voice matters just the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| So reaching out to them by atypical means, if I can bring myself back to, going out and reaching out to them one by one is one way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| But utilizing the city's methods of communication in a 21st century age I think is something that needs to be greater expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7553)|
| 2:06:01| We live in a time where we can communicate in ways that we never dreamed of even 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| And being able to make people know that they both matter to the process and can be included in the process through very simple means is important to be accessed through those channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:16| Social media, news media, print media, and door-to-door efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| I think that's probably two minutes, so I'm going to go ahead and stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints that may not be in line with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people who you have opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| I was raised in a straight ticket Republican household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| I was taught that if you have an R after your name or you have a red band in the thing you see on TV, then that's the person you should support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:59| And unfortunately, it became apparent to me that that was a flawed view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| It was not the only thing that mattered when choosing a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| I worked with a straight Democratic voter, a straight blue ticket person, who turned me around on a very important issue because we engaged on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| That issue was the death penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| I never had an issue with it growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| I never gave it second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| There's somebody I worked with, who I actually grew up with, who worked tirelessly for death penalty advocacy, who met with people on the death row, and whose efforts on those and conversations with me is something that allowed me to see a larger view and eventually changed my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:40| I know this isn't relative to city council, but it is a major issue that would have been endemic to me as an individual prior that I was able to change my view on because I listened, actually listened to somebody with the understanding that I might be wrong about an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:55| If you go to somebody and talk to them without that basic understanding that you might be wrong, then all you're doing is giving a joint press conference and no collusion, no actual collaboration can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| You have to have that basic, humble understanding of the fact that you don't know everything, that the other person's views are just as valid as your own, and without truly hearing what they're having to say, you're not ever going to grow as a person and as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:21| As city council representatives, our most basic right, our most basic job is to represent those in our districts and in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:30| And if you don't have that understanding, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:48| I have been on disability for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| I had a major medical catastrophe as a 20-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| I was in the hospital for eight major operations over a period of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| I spent more than a year and a half in the hospital and came out of it in pretty sorry shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| I was exposed to all kinds of issues in the medical profession, the ways that we go about treating disease and thinking about illness, and it changed my perceptions about a lot of things and it shaped who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:23| But more importantly, it set me back in life in ways that I did not think were ever able to be overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| One of the most important of those is I became a casualty of the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| I was placed in medical pain management to survive after those surgeries, and it became an addiction, as those places are absolutely 100% legal drug dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:47| There is nothing about them that is beneficial to the community on the scale that they operate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| Thankfully, with the grace of God and the support of my family, I was able to leave that unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| And in the two years that have intervened since then, I have become the person that you see in front of me, healthy, inhale, still carrying the scars of my medical past, but able to participate in society in a way that wouldn't have been possible in any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:16| I represent an understanding that just because I look normal, you may not be normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| There are all kinds of scars and things that we carry around with us that if you don't know what to look for, you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:31| There are ways that you look at the world that you can't understand unless you've been through those experiences, and that's what I bring to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:40| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| I'm sorry, could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| This is an area that I think Stephanie excelled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| Stephanie was not swayed by clickbait headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| Stephanie was adept at going and meeting people where they were, finding out what their concerns were, and then working to the best of her ability to meet those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| The thing that springs to mind when we talk about land use right now is the Sutree Landing development in South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| Now, this is an area that's being developed within the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| which has very specific tenants built into it very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| This is code that's barely 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| And despite that, you have a developer who's come in and purchased property, understanding full well what the code called for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| and has a plan which violates that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| They've gone to BZA and they've secured a zoning variance for it in a manner that I think is unfair, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:15| The zoning variance that they received has to have a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| There's two form-based codes in the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| This one is the younger of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| This is a very new and followable code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| So for the residents of the South Waterfront whose neighborhood is being brought into upheaval by this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:46| it's not okay for a developer to come and run roughshod over them just because they don't want to follow the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| You asked how I would get to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| I would get to the bottom of it, which is to meet with both parties and hope for a negotiated solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| I understand that in this case that didn't actually happen, and I'm very saddened by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| But the reality is the neighborhood concerns and those of developers or other entities are just as important as one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| and one cannot run roughshod over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| There has to be a negotiated solution that starts with listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| In your list of priorities, what are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| What should change? What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| Public safety is everything. It's the first thing we all think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| If you're not safe at night, literally nothing else matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| So having a police department that is properly manned, or properly staffed, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| I have an example of this from barely a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| When coming back from canvassing, I encountered a vehicle that was driving erratically, a person who was clearly acting unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| and the call to 911 kept me on the phone for 30 minutes before an officer was able to respond to this clear and present danger that was being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:08| I know the officers that responded. They're good people. They're diligent at their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| but they just don't have the manpower to keep up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| Filling those seats, making sure that there are enough officers so that the ones who are on duty do not find themselves overworked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| making bad decisions, being unsafe for either themselves or the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| it should be a priority for us as council representatives and for a city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| Beyond that, communities need to police themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| They need to trust their law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| And what exists now, fairly or unfairly, is a perception that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| I don't know what the magic wand is to solve that particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| but I know that we need to study it diligently and we need to address it, as it is a very real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| If that means greater recruitment efforts within the city, if it means destigmatizing the police officers that exist now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| if it means simply talking to one another and having a more robust way to deal with conflicts when they arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| all of those things should be considered and they should be implemented sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| Give us the people that we need. Engage the communities to make sure that they feel safe, not just that they are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:23| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country, homelessness, poverty, low wages, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:29| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:42| Homelessness is one of those things. It is a tragedy when it takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| and it is deserving of our utmost efforts to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| There are a number of factors associated with homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| several of which are ably met by the Office of Homelessness in the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| agencies like VMC, like CARM, and like the Salvation Army,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| and by people who are just going out like the Next Step Initiative and doing the work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Government needs to support and enable and empower those whose passion it is to take care of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| more than trying to solve it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| I run a ropes course. I love running a ropes course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| I think I was referred to as a monkey twice by my supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| Clearly I should have gotten script approval on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| I can tell you everything there is to know about being a ropes course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| but the first step we can take is be responsible stewards of the resources we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| in order to empower those who are best positioned to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| When you have somebody like Rebecca Parr who is out there making sure people are fed and clothed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| when you have VMC screaming at the top of their lungs for permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| and caseworkers who can meet the needs of individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| when it comes to living wage, I want to court good industry to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| I want to raise the standard of living in this city in a way that doesn't sound like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| the government is picking and choosing who's going to survive and who's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| The role of government should be to support but not directly affect all of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| We have to be reasonable in what we can accomplish and understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| the role of city council, what role do you believe you should play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:42| in helping our city achieve racial equity and address lingering historic disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| that have resulted in a 42 percent poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:55| Let me say first that that number is appalling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| That one segment of this society should be so utterly thrust upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| The root causes of that go back decades and centuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| and there is no amount of apologizing that could ever make up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| It's also something that I'm always going to have a limited understanding of because of the way I look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| When I walk out my front door, I don't have to think about the same things that a person of color does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| Hearing somebody in that and understanding what it is that they're going through is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| Leading by example is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| We have a council that is amazingly representative of their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| more so I think than any time in history, and that is encouraging to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| What's also encouraging to me is that it wasn't as remarkable as it should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| when we had seven female representatives on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| A lot of us in the community went, hey, gosh, you're right, there sure are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| It wasn't remarkable, and that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| Having a community that's represented just as a normal course of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| whether they're man, woman, or of color, as a natural thing, is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| It exists in large issues like mandatory minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| It exists in small, minute issues like who gets followed around a grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| which I cannot believe still happens in 2020, but it absolutely does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| Leading by example is the most important thing that council can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| Understanding and hearing those issues is the most important thing that council can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| It's those small interactions. It's those small moments that builds momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| There's not a national policy we're going to roll out tomorrow that says, okay, racism's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| It's not going to work that way, but in the individual interactions that we have, we can make progress day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| What three steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| Expansion of the urban wilderness is a top priority for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| Making sure that this jewel in our empire of a city is as glistening as is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| will provide for economic development decades into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| We are already a destination on a national level with people coming just to experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| We have an impressive gateway park that's being built, and we have an impressive second phase that will take political will to be accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:34| but that will make it an even more impressive stature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| This, among with other developments in the city, will make sure that the city is financially viable into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| People coming here, people spending money, people doing business is the way the city grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| You ask for three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| The first is absolutely key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| Spending into the red, spending on things we can't afford, acting in a manner that will drain the city and put it in crisis where it has to make snap decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| or make ones that are going to drive away either industry or citizenry is how a city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| Third is to make the city as livable as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| I moved here from Atlanta six years ago with my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| We moved to Knoxville six years before we moved, so I knew I was moving to a great place, but I didn't know how great until I actually got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| Knoxville is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| There's just something about this city, and to be able to continue that is the thing that's going to keep us viable in the future, not just because we have good jobs, but because when you come here, you don't want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:44| Keeping that spirit going, keeping that interaction going is what sets Knoxville apart in the grand scheme of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| That concludes the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| Regarding the budget, where do you think we should be spending more money, and what should we cut to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:12| I don't have a specific request in terms of cutting or adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| I do think that it is important that anything we add needs to be revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:25| Here's the thing about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| I don't think it's accessible to the average citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| I don't think that it's put in such a way that anybody individually can understand what's going on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| If we hear at another meeting we need to spend $4 million on, I don't know, potted plants, whatever the thing is, those numbers don't mean anything to me as a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:51| Is that a lot of money? Is that a little money? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| What I want is budget accessibility so that when I'm being asked as a taxpayer what I want the budget spent on and how I want that represented, when I'm going out to my district and saying these are the priorities we've set, I want to be able to put that in terms that they can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| I'll pay $400-something in city property taxes and another, I don't know how much, in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8582)|
| 2:23:18| I want to be able to say, look, I pay $50 a year for a police force, $40 a year for a fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| I want to be able to say, and I understand it's more complicated than that, I want to be able to say in reasonable terms what we're spending money on and how we're spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| So that when you ask questions like that, I'm more able to say, well, is this worth saving $15 a year or is it worth spending another $15 a year in order to achieve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:42| That's what I want done with respect to the budget. I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| Okay. Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| It's a difficult question. I was wanting to hear kind of, I guess, your priorities. And it's difficult to get specific because it is. It's a give and take and a pull from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| Absolutely. I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:09| I think affordable housing has to have more money put into it because it's something that's going to drive the city. It's going to have that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| What it takes, what you asked what we want to pull for, that would take a more collaborative effort from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| I don't want to speak to that individually. I know that that's a priority and it's something that I'm willing to find room in the budget for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| I'm also, quite honestly, worth going to the taxpayers and saying, would you pay an extra $15 a month if it meant we could provide a thousand more houses for those who are desperately in need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:41| Hopefully that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| Your district, of course, would include Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| Could you just talk generally about what your representation of that area would look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| It would be hands on is the best way I can say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| Fort Sanders is sort of the weird apportionment when it comes to the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| It's a little bit like Knoxville, but there's just as much over there as there is over here, both in terms of the businesses that are represented along the Covenant Avenue corridor and the student body that's represented in the housing that's adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:25| I'm sure there are people other than just students there. There are normal residents, but that primarily makes up the residential block over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| These are people who are engaged. I can't help but notice there's an awful lot of young people in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| They want to be a part of what's going on and I think has been historically either by design or just lack of engagement disenfranchised from the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:47| Their voices matter just as much as anybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| And I can't say that I represent the district if I never spend any time over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| The business owners along Covenant Avenue are going to have different needs than the ones along Chapman Highway, that the ones are along Old Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| And if you can't talk to people, if you can't get over there and find out what those needs are, then you can't possibly represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:12| Mr. Ream, very briefly, this seat will be up for election next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| Would you seek this seat whether you were the successful candidate or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| If I'm a successful candidate or not, the answer is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| I've had a lot of time to think about this and I haven't been able to come up with an answer because, frankly, I don't have all the variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| I can give you the equation that I would use in that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| The incumbency is a powerful tool, either pro or against re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| It was actually pointed out to me by Vice Mayor McKenzie in our meeting that if a controversial issue comes up and I'm forced to vote on it in a way that requires explaining, the shortness of the term means that I may not have enough time to get that word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8807)|
| 2:27:00| And so it could be an anchor rather than a buoy in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| That said, historically, the incumbency is a more powerful weapon than it is a weaker one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| Generally, if you are incumbent, you get re-elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| And that incumbency comes at the cost of an appointment makes me uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| In order to be able to run were I appointed, it would mean that I was able to assure myself that I was not giving myself an insurmountable advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:30| In the next election, if I felt for any reason that that was the case or that the constituency was not happy with my representation, then I would not seek re-election at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:39| I would in the future, but not at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| So I don't have enough information to answer the question yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| It has to have to be answered at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| Whether if I am not appointed tonight, that's going to depend on the representation we do end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart1?start=8874)|
