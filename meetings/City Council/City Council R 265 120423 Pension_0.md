| 0:00:00| Let's go ahead and call this City of Knoxville workshop to order, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| Let's see, Councilman Delvaux, if you'll have the invocation and Finn Barber, the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=10)|
| 0:00:18| All stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| Heavenly Father, thank you for the opportunity and the challenge to represent our city and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=21)|
| 0:00:29| Especially as we tackle difficult questions that affect the lives of our employees and the well-being of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=29)|
| 0:00:38| Help us to keep an open mind as we look at various aspects of a complicated problem and arrive at a solution that benefits everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=38)|
| 0:00:49| And Lord, we keep in mind those who are less fortunate than us. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| Please face the flag and render the salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Councilman Graham? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Councilman Campin? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Councilman Delvaux? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Councilman Grieve? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Councilman Palmer? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Vice Mayor Pavlis? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Councilman Saunders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Councilman Steyer? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Councilman Wallace? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Push this button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Yeah, push the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| And that's a perfect segue into, it's a little bit more difficult meeting in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| so I would ask that, and we don't have the lights in front of us, but if you'll just kind of give me a hands up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| so we're not talking over each other and give everybody the respect that they're due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| The administration, if they have comments, will come at the end if they have any at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=124)|
| 0:02:13| So we'll go right into the agenda with KPD, Chief Roush, or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=133)|
| 0:02:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor, I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I guess for the record, I'm Chief David Roush, Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| I don't know if you need my address or any of that, but if we can dispense with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| I appreciate you giving us this opportunity to address council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| and I'm not going to stand here and give you a bunch of numbers and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| You've heard all those numbers, and I know the employee groups last week did a fine job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| of talking about the importance of our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| I want to talk to you a little bit about why it's important to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| in terms of what we do every day and how we are able to get the talent that we have in this department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| specifically about the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| I think Councilman DeLaValle, in his prayer, said it very succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| I think this is a tough challenge, and hopefully we can get that guidance that we need to make the right decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| and to keep a focus on what we're doing in terms of not only our current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| but also those that come in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| While this is a challenge that we are faced with, it's not a unique challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| It's not a new challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| It's a challenge that councils before you have dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| and it's a challenge that, quite frankly, the chiefs before me have dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| To set the plan where we are today, it took a lot of hard work on a lot of people's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| to get us to where we are today with our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| I hope that while we are looking to the future and understanding the challenges that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| that we don't forget the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| That we don't forget the difficult decisions that had to be made back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| to get us to where we are today with the plans that we have in place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| This, again, is not something unique to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Many cities are dealing with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| I have done some research and actually sent some information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| asking what other cities have faced and what they're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| and what we found in that, specifically in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| is that very few cities are changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Now, I don't know how they justify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I don't know what their books look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| but I do know that the response I keep getting back is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| those who have their own pension systems right now haven't done anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| So I don't know if it's the wait and watch syndrome or what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| but I know that they haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| I look around the country at cities that have done some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| and what I see is some of what you had presented to you by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| is looking at adjustments and not tossing completely away from a current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| or defined benefit package, but making adjustments that make physical sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| And so I've seen some of those and those are, again, pretty much all over the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| but typically what you see them making is changes in vesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| changes in retirement age, changes in employee contributions, changes in multipliers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| and those are the kind of things that I have seen other cities like Atlanta Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Atlanta specifically, one that I have read recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| And so there are ways of working on this problem without tossing it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| and trying to start anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| And so I think that's important that that's taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| I think there's a reason for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| I think those cities have realized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| I think it's something our city needs to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| One thing I think is important is keeping in mind the uniqueness of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| And specifically I'm going to talk about public safety because that's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| And so I can tell you that we have an amazing police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| And the year that I have been in charge of this department, I've been here 19 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| and until you're the person that has to answer all the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| you don't realize what all we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| And I can tell you this department isn't built on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| This department is built on talent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| and the talent is the officers that are out there working every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| putting their efforts forth every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| And, of course, I would tell you that I know I've heard all the back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| about what's being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| but I would tell you that a promise has been made to these current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and I think that's a promise that should be kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| And these folks haven't done anything to break their promise to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| and that is to keep this city safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And they work hard at that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And so I think the key, number one, is that we keep the promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| that we've made to these employees currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Now, facing the employees of the future, well, how do you handle them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| What do you do in order to make this something that is viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| that the citizens can afford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| And I think there are ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| And so I think we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| You know, I think as you look at how it impacts us, we look at recruitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| we look at hiring, we look at retaining great employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| That's our focus, is in order to be who we are and what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| and to have the reputation that we have, not only in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| but the reputation that we have throughout this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| and I would tell you internationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| is we've got to continue to be able to recruit and hire and retain great employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| And that doesn't happen by just a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| And so benefits are very important as you look at the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| Currently it costs us approximately $100,000 to recruit, train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| and equip a new officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| $100,000 is what we have put on it as the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| And that's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| That's an investment that shouldn't be taken lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| To change and toss out our benefit packages that are important for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| to be able to bring in the quality that we bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| is something that I ask you to be cautious with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| You know, one of the things we know is we get a much more savvy employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| than we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| When I came on 19 years ago, I can't tell you I was looking at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| You know, when I came here, I was looking for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| And that's a whole lot different than what we're seeing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| We're seeing savvy, smart employees that are doing their research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| They're going on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| They're looking up what cities have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And I can tell you, we know that because we poll them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| We talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| And so they come to Knoxville with a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| They come to Knoxville to be able to be well compensated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| to be able to be in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Either the paid benefits, but they come here because it's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| And they stay here because it's a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| And so, you know, it's all ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| But they're here because of what we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| And we benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| We benefit from that every day on the streets out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| While our pay and benefits are nice, they are not the most competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=618)|
| 0:10:27| They are, and I'm sure when civil service talks to you about the surveys they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| what they do is they find the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| And we try to get everybody to the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Well, I can tell you for a fact, and I'll speak just for the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| I can guarantee you I interact with every agency in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| And I can tell you we don't have average employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| We have amazing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| We have exceptional employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| And I would tell you that to impact that negatively would be to impact the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| that we have in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| And so I caution you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| I would tell you that we want to make sure we do the cost-benefit analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| that we look at return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| We look at all those important things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| You know, we think about things like cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| And I know there's a cost to a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| And I know there are risks with pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| But there's also a cost to not having the right employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And there is a risk, especially in law enforcement, to not having the right employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| There is a financial risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| There is a legal risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| And I've looked back at the numbers 2008, 2009, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| I haven't had a chance to get into the 2011 numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| But in terms of litigation caused by the police department ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| paid out in litigation for actions of the Knoxville Police Department in 2008, 2009, and 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| zero dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Zero dollars paid out in litigation because of the actions of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Now that doesn't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| And that doesn't happen by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| That happens by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| That happens by great hiring, by retaining the right people, by training the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| That's how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| And I would caution you that to change the opportunity for us to get the best employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| will cost us somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| That risk is something you've got to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| That risk in terms of litigation is something we have to pay close attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| And so I'd caution you and ask you to be very mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| One of the other things I would tell you to take a look at is, and we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| and I mentioned earlier actually, I spent about four hours ago, I had a press conference talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| was able to recognize some of our employees, both civilian and sworn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| and it started making me think about the value that you place on these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| How do we value what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| And how do you add that value up to compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| We talk about it earlier, I recognize an employee who saved the life of a seven-week-old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| literally brought the child back from death, and the child was there with us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| four and a half months old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| That's impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| How do you value that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| How do you put a value on that kind of work that's being done in our community by employees of this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| You talk about a guy like, and that was Richard Simmons, Officer Richard Simmons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| you talk about a guy like Officer Mike Riddle, who runs into a burning apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| and gets folks out of that building so that their lives aren't in danger, putting himself at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| How do you value that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| You talk about young officers, Andrew Keith and Steve Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| who work up on the interstate to get a state trooper, Trooper Russell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| out of his burning vehicle to save his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| How do you put a price on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| How do you value that kind of service to this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| You talk about Andy Olson, who last February, shot in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| His femur had to be completely regrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| As a matter of fact, Andy would be here tonight, but he's in surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| He's having more surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| A year and a couple months later, he's still having surgeries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| How do you value the service that a young officer like that gives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| Andy has been with us now just a little over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| He's not even vested in our program yet, but he had a promise when he got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| He had a promise that we would have something for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Andy is going to stick with us, and he's going to keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| He's going to be one of these guys who will retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| How do you value the rest of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| There's a price that goes with all of this, I think, in terms of our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| about the great work being done by the men and women in this city and in my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| I just ask you to think in terms of that when you think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| That's the current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| We've got to think about the future as well, because there is a future Andy Olson out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| There's a future Richard Simmons out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| There's a future Mike Riddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| They're out there just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| They're right now in grade school somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Someday they'll be wearing this uniform and wearing this badge and serving this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| I think our responsibility is to make sure that those fine employees have something to look forward to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| that they get a good package, they get a good benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| and that when they do their service of 25, 30 years, that they're taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| When they do that service, think about being out here on the line every day with your life on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| literally, in the service of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| How do you put a value on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| What is that value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I ask you to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| I was in some training this weekend, and I have a point that I want to leave you with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| that I thought was very appropriate when I heard it this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| I think it really gives some thought about what you're challenged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| It's called the paradoxical commandments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| It talks about courage, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Love them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Do good anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| If you're successful, you win false friends and true enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Succeed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Do good anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Be honest and frank anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| The biggest men with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men with the smallest minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Think big anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Fight for a few underdogs anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Build anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| People really need help but may attack you if you help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Help people anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Give the world the best you have anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| What I'm asking you, Council, as you consider what you do in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| is have the courage to do the right thing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Regardless of what we hear from all the naysayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| I tell you to keep your mind open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| to consider the hard work that's being put forth by our employees every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| and to think about that and do the right thing and do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| And I'll take any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| If you could, unless you have another appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| No, I'm good. I can stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| We may have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Absolutely. I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Excuse me. I need to push this magic button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I'll ask one anyway, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| You know, what you said has a lot of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Obviously our people are our first line of defense, our service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| When we look at this, we still have to tackle where does the money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| And you mentioned that there were some ideas around the country that were being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Did you have anything more specific on any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| or just that those were the things in the toolbox that we've got to work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Yeah, I can pull some more of that for you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| But the common themes that I've seen is they're looking at adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| and not changing the complete plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So I can certainly pull those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| There's a website that I go to frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| There's a governing magazine that I read frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| and has a lot of great information about these types of incidents or issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And I can certainly forward some of that to you so that you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| That would be a help because, again, this is a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| We're trying to do right by the employees, but trying to do right by the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| And when you look at that graph that Mr. Pennington shares with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and things start skyrocketing to the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| it's kind of frightening in terms of where those dollars are going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| what services are we going to cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Are we going to have layoffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| What are we going to do to make up that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And that's the hard part of the problem is how do we do that and do it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| so that everyone wins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Sure, and I appreciate the level of seriousness that you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| And I know that you're constantly weighing that cost-benefit on how you do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1187)|
| 0:19:56| and how we do it physically and being responsible and sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| And I encourage you to look at the administration has made some great recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I think, in terms of what are possibilities that are out there that you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| to continue to take care of those future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| But I certainly will send you some of what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I feel like we're in a locker room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I'm ready to go out and fight for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I can see why you guys like working for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I'm impressed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| In talking about future employees and talking about recruiting employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| and just looking at that aspect of it as we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| and some of the plans that the mayor has put on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| and just in general, I mean, these hybrids, do you think, in a general way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| do you think that those put you at a disadvantage in recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| I'm not talking about retaining now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I'm talking about recruiting new employees when you're out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| and you've seen other cities that have put forth similar programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Do you think that that type of program, in general sense, would put you at a disadvantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| I think that it makes it a little more difficult on the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| Now, I think that the hybrid is better than the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Obviously, in terms of what I can sell better than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| It really comes to what package I end up having to go out there and try to peddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| Quite frankly, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I spend a lot of time trying to get good people coming to our city to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| We have a recruiter that does that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| I would tell you that, obviously, the package we have now is nice, and it makes it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| At times, not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| I can tell you there are cities that are better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| They're still strong, and there always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| I mean, that's part of competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| But I can tell you that I've seen what the administration has put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| and the hybrid is something that's better than the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| In your department, when we talk about the vested and the non-vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| what are the numbers in terms of the vested and non-vested in the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| That's a good question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I don't have specifics, and I'd say somebody probably does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Looks like somebody's finding them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| There's always somebody that can find those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| While we're kind of at a pause, there's plenty of room up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| I wanted to come up this way and let everybody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| I think there's some outside the glass doors, perhaps not, but there's plenty of room up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1366)|
| 0:22:56| I think he's got the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| I do. I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| As of the last valuation date, July 1, 2011, there were 691 members in Division C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| Of those 691, 546 were vested, 145 were not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Are you looking at page 5 of your report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Councilman Brady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Chief, thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| What's your turnover rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Currently, actually, we're at a better spot than we've ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I can tell you we are seeing very low turnover at this point, which is great, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| When you look at stability, it's a key part of safety in order to keep our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| Familiarity really does help, especially in policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| The officers get to know the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| The community gets to know the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| The trust is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I think that's also one of those indicators in terms of the litigation issue I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| That's one of those great indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| If I'm able to retain good people, and we can keep them here for the long run, then we all win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| We've got a safer community, and we've got a better department, and we've got a better relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| I can tell you it's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I know this year we've lost about six, but that's all had to do with retirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| and it's had to do with a brand new class coming on, and you're not going to keep all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| There's always a washout rate that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Some just can't transfer the knowledge that they learned in the academy to the street, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| That's the reality of what we do, and so some of that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| We started out the year, I think, we started out with about 418 as our staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| We're down to 413, so we've lost five bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| But again, those numbers have come off because of retirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| and because of our field training program, which is doing what it's supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| and that's keeping the good people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Very low rate of folks' turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Yes, it's very low right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I would tell you the percentage is less than ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| It's seven, sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Again, look for the numbers guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Chief Rouse, speaking of attracting quality officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| do you have any idea approximately or an estimate how many are from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| or the metropolitan area on your force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Oh gosh, on the force total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| I could not even fathom that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I can look that up for you, Mark, and get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| As far as specifically Knoxvillians, I wouldn't even try to guess that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| I'd say we're probably better than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| More than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| I could confidently say that, but I don't know the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Maybe we can pull the audience in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I've got a pretty good crowd here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Well, it might be a microcosm of the force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| but of the officers in the room, how many are from Knoxville or the metropolitan area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| All right, I'm going up to 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| This is one I don't even know how to ask, but it's troubling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| and it's the one I hear sort of on the street, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Let me back up and start this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Twenty years ago, lots of folks didn't make it past about 69, 70, 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| and they were off to see their maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Now we have better health care and people are living longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| and the question comes up, if we have folks retiring at 50, 53, 55, 57, two things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1606)|
| 0:26:56| One is they don't simply retire and go to the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| They often take a second job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| They've retired with 75% of their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| They take a second job and work for five or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| But they often live to 75, 85, even 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And so the cost downstream is a lot larger than in the good old days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| And I'm not sure that dying young is the good old days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| but I'm saying there's a difference temporarily in what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| due to health care progress and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| That adds to the cost burden of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| and I can't figure out how we answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| but it means that each individual that's in the system that retires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| puts a bigger burden, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Now that doesn't mean to say they didn't earn it, they didn't give good service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| but it does mean that the carrying cost might go out for 25, 35, 40 years after they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| And I don't know how we tackle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| but the cost in the pot has to grow to meet that expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| I think Alan said at our last meeting we were paying out about $40 million in benefits last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| Is that what we paid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| And I assume that that increases based on numbers I've seen in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Is that right, that it grows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| It grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| It doesn't decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| How do we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Well, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| I can't say that we hope that we all die young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Yeah, that's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| We don't want the cool-out solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| As a matter of fact, one of the things that I'm pushing is physical fitness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| so that we live a little longer so we can enjoy our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| And I'll tell you, though, what I do know about some of those extra jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| or the second jobs after they retire, a lot of that has to do with insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| Many of the retirees that I've had conversations with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| the reason they work a second job is because they can't afford their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| An individual onesie plan is a lot more expensive than a group plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And they can't afford that with the pension that they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| and trying to maintain their household and then pay for medical benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| And so that's why they're going and getting those second jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| is so that they can have insurance and be able to continue to function now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and to live a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Well, that's what you need the most when you get older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| And I don't know what the average age is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I assume Mr. Pennington probably can answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| of about where the age of a retired cop is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| I know it's raised a bit because of health benefits that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| They have definitely been going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| The mortality rates have been improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| We don't usually look at the average age of the retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| but just the general probability of death at each particular age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| Clearly there's been significant improvements over the last even just ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| I don't know that there's a fix for the specificity of the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| I think you have to consider that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| as you're looking at making those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| and financially trying to figure out how you sustain a system into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| And that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| But I don't think it's an insurmountable mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| I think it's something that fine folks who know how to put numbers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| can certainly give some great advice on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Yes, it just so happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I think there was an article in the paper today about life expectancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| And for Knox County, for men, if I remember what I read, it was 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| That's the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| For some of us who won't leave office before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| I'm not sure how many years more I have to work, but I know it'll be several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| But I only have probably about ten years if that's the average after I leave here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1858)|
| 0:31:07| Chief, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Chief Scharff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Sorry, I don't know how you follow that, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| If you like spire, you're fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Yeah, that's an extremely hard act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| First of all, I want to thank all of you, Vice Mayor Pavlis and Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| for the series of workshops that you've had to try to address this difficult issue on our pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| and also for giving all of us a chance to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I guess the main point that I want to make, a lot of it you've already heard from Chief Rausch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| is that just to talk about the importance of a very competitive pension plan to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| Again, I'll be repeating some of the things he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| The main reason, obviously, to have a competitive pension plan is because it is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| and makes us competitive in recruiting and in retaining employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| There's no doubt in my mind that the current pension plan plays a very important role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| in both recruiting good employees and then retaining well-trained, seasoned, experienced firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1950)|
| 0:32:39| I'll try to support that statement in just a couple of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| First of all, we do have a very good retention rate of firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Councilman Grieve asked about that just a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| We currently have approximately 300 firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| During the last three calendar years, we've lost an average of approximately three per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| that just voluntarily left the department to go on to other departments or to go on to other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| That's about 1% per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| If you look back further, we still have a very good retention rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| It's not quite that low, 1% per year, but it's still very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| What I've seen in the stats that I looked at is those that are here for at least five or six or seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| we have a very low rate of those who voluntarily leave the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| After they've been trained, gained experience, become seasoned firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| and become vested in a pension system, then it is really, I guess, more difficult for them to leave financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| They have a true strong incentive to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2025)|
| 0:33:57| The second thing I'll mention about retention, this is more just anecdotal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| For the 16 years that I've been on this department, we've talked at fire stations and elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| about the reasons people come to take this job and the reasons they stay in this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| A lot of it is because they love what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| They love firefighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| They love helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| They love this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| They enjoy living in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| It's one of the most beautiful areas in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| But another thing that always comes up is the pension plan that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| Conversations lead to, yeah, the pay may not be as good as I could get somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| but I have a good retirement plan set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| And there's no doubt in my mind that there would be a lot more people leave the department down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| if they just have a pension plan that they can take with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| They get trained here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| They gain experience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| And then if they can just take that and go to another department, they're more likely to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| So it is extremely important for retaining good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2106)|
| 0:35:17| I guess another point I want to make is the importance of retaining employees down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| after they have been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| It takes years and years to become a good, seasoned, experienced firefighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| where you can make decisions in a split second, which we have to do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| Even though we have a really good training academy, 28 weeks of some of the best training that you can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| you still only really become a good, experienced firefighter through years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| years of seeing fires and learning how to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| And once you get to that level, those are the ones we really don't want to lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| because it's like if you have a football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| You don't want to lose any of your players, but you sure don't want to lose your veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| the ones that have gained that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Those are the ones you really want to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And without a good pension plan, it's more likely for them to go off somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| and to other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| The other point, I know Chief Roush already mentioned this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| is that training is extremely expensive and time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Like I mentioned before, we have a 28-week academy, but that just gets them started in their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| It costs us approximately $50,000 to get somebody from beginning to end in the training academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2203)|
| 0:36:52| And then after that, again, there's still a probationary period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and that's where the on-the-job training comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| How long is that probationary period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| It's a year, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So you've got a year and a half in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2230)|
| 0:37:21| I guess I'll just try and sum this up, that basically recruiting, hiring firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| is a very long, labor-intensive, expensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Once they've been trained and gained the experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| you certainly want to do the best you can to retain those good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| And there's no doubt in my mind that a good competitive pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| is an important part of recruiting and retaining those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| And just like Chief Roush bragged on his employees, I want to brag on mine for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| I won't go into too much in-depth, but our employees work extremely hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| They put their life on the line every day for the citizens and visitors to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| Just today, as a matter of fact, we've already dealt with two house fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| two working house fires that our people were working hard to serve the citizens here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| and to protect lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| We do that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Again, we as a city have made a commitment to these employees, our current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and we need to do what we can to honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| They came here with the understanding of the pension that would be for them down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| and obviously we need to do what we can to honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| And I'll be glad to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| When folks leave, I would assume you do exit interviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Could you share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Since I've been chief, obviously there haven't been that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I'll try to remember those that have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Most of them have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Let me be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| It is to other fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| The ones I can remember recently, we lost one to Memphis, Atlanta, Charleston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| South Carolina, Chattanooga, and then we had one or two go to either EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2357)|
| 0:39:28| or other fire departments up north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Now those are the recent ones I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| There was a time period that we lost a lot to Oak Ridge, the labs specifically, not the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| because their pay was so much better than ours is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Their pension is not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| It's not as good, but their pay was a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Through the 90s into the early 2000s, we lost a lot to the plants out at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2389)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I'm trying to, as I've learned by both information sharing and people clubbing me over the head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| I'm trying to understand more about the pension thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| I sense both emotionally and even legally people say that benefits should not change for vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| The question I have is do you think your firefighters are willing to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| to solve some of the cost side of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Because the cost keeps rocketing up, and we sort of have to share that somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| and I'm hoping that there's both ideas and an open mind to that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| I understand that, and I do believe that they're willing to work with counsel on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Did your guys have any specific suggestions or ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| or just they're willing to talk it out and see where it takes us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| I don't have any specific suggestions that I've received from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| but there are certainly areas that I think we would be more than willing to talk about and negotiate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2462)|
| 0:41:12| The thing, just like Chief Roush mentioned, is we definitely want to retain some sort of a defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| because the defined contribution, that's where if they just take it with them and go off to another department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| they're obviously much more likely to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| They don't have any ties to homes, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120423pension?start=2489)|
