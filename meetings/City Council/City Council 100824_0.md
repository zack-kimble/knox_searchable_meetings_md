| 0:00:00| Good evening. I'd like to call to order the regular council meeting for August 24th and I'd like to ask Mr. Woodhull if you don't mind asking our invocation and we'll ask Mr. Greve as a welcome home to lead us in the pledge after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=0)|
| 0:00:20| Okay if we could stand. Bow our heads. Thank you father for this opportunity to gather in the spirit of collaboration and humility.

Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=20)|

| 0:01:43| Items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| That was supposed to go on. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| I'm going to ask for postponement. I think it's 11N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| Yep. I would like to postpone 11N for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| 11N for two weeks. Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Because apparently there's some changes in something and want to get a revised version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| Comments, questions? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| All those in favor of postponing 11N for two weeks, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Opposed, no. Okay. It's postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Okay. Added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Okay. Consent items are 11R through 11W. Is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Questions? All those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| Opposed, no. Okay. That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Mayor's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Oh, excuse me. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I'll ask that we put on consent 12B through 12D, which are the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Motion second to put 12B through 12D on the ‑‑ or to approve those together as well right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| Second to that. Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Parliamentarily, we've already approved the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Mr. Swanson, do you have a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| You could do it by consensus or you can simply move to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| We could do it by consensus. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| Without objection, I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Okay. All those in favor of approving 12B through D, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Opposed, no. Okay. They're approved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| Okay. On the mayor's report, just three items of personal note, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| First of all, I want to congratulate Mr. Bailey on the birth of a son here the week before last, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Congratulations. I know you have an active and full household now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Hope you're getting some sleep occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| And it was awful nice to, when they called Mr. Grieve, to have a hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| We have missed you, and I think we're all unanimous in expressing to you how much we missed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| and how glad we are to have you back and glad to see you looking well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| I know you still have a little bit of recovery to do, but we're very, very glad you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I know there's an item that actually comes up later on a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| but I actually really, as the run of my mayor's report, wanted to thank and recognize Sam Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| I know we're going to do that later, but as part of the mayor's report, while we're all still fresh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and before we have two or three long, hard discussions, I think it's important that we recognize Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| Sam, and I might be wrong on this, but by my calculation, is probably the longest-serving city director in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| He's been a city director for 23 years, and before that was a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| So he's really worked for the city of Knoxville for over 34 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and served in a variety of roles from teacher and coach to parks and rec director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| director of operations, senior director of operations and efficiency, which he is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and a lot of roles in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| But beyond all that, Sam, to me, has been a model of what somebody should look like when they serve the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| He's done it always with wisdom and with humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I just know from my own standpoint, I'm going to miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| When you come in as a new mayor, it helps to have some people who know the ropes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| but know them in a way that doesn't come with their own bias or agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And from the very first moment when I became mayor, Sam has given great counsel and great insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| and worked hard and really served the city well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| I know I'm going to miss him both as a friend but also as somebody who has served the city well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| So an occasion like this where somebody has served for so long and so well in such an important position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| I just wanted to make certain that we appropriately recognize Sam and thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| My sense is he's not gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| He'll still be around to help on a lot of things, but I don't think we'll see him sitting in that chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| at city council meetings on a regular occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| But I did want to just take this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Like I said, we're going to recognize him later, but as a point of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| I wanted to recognize and personally thank Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| You've served our city well, and I, for one, am very grateful and will miss having you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Mayor, I just want to say as well that I don't think there's anybody since I've been here that I've served with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| that has any more institutional knowledge of the city than Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| He's been a real resource and he's in it, as you say, he's been in it for the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| He's made a great contribution to the city and he'll be missed but not gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| And he already said he's going to be playing golf two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| I don't know where he's going to be, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| There's Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| I'd like to add my two cents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| I mean, he definitely has institutional knowledge, but he has wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| And I've appreciated the many conversations that you've afforded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| He's got that mother wit, you know, that insight on human personalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| Not that we have to deal with personalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| That was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| No, but you're sort of, without the age, you're sort of like one of the elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| And I appreciate you've got the age, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| But I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| I thank you for your wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| There's a generation of students in Knox County schools and city of Knoxville schools that have benefited from Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| And a few individuals who would tell you that they ended up going to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| and having a whole different life because Sam was their teacher or coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And I think at the end of the day, all of us would take that kind of result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| So, Sam, on behalf of the city of Knoxville, thank you very much and we will miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=453)|
| 0:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| He'll kill me for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Okay, moving on to reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Yes, I just wanted to report that this council had approved, as part of a capital budget, I think $112,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=480)|
| 0:08:11| for the acquisition of a property at the now Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| It was named yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| And they had the grand opening of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| And the county commission last night has moved forward to try to get that under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| So they are working on the project and fulfilling the kind of joint effort that you helped initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| And we want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| But actually, you helped initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| And we followed your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Yeah, we followed your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| And thank you very much for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Last night we had a meeting at the Cumberland Estates Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| Great turnout of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| And part of the highlight of the evening was that the Western Avenue Oak Ridge Highway, State Route 62, is progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| And everybody is excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| And we have kind of a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| I'd like to thank everybody who helped and came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Let me do two quick announcements and then some council business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| First off, I want to remind folks that another one of our discussions about the 10-year plan is happening tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| 6 o'clock, at the Cancerly Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| This will be a presentation for 30 minutes on addiction treatment and 30 minutes of questions and discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| Also tomorrow, the Brown Bag Green Book is happening at noon at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| Don Barger will be discussing rewilding words, the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| And Don is one of the longest people I've known in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| He was like the third person I met when I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| So don't hold that against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Council business, I want to talk quickly about a couple workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| I think I will ask Ms. Wilson to get an e-mail about this tomorrow, and we'll go over that again tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| I have got a request for sort of two right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| One on the KUB tree trim panel report, which should be coming out around the middle of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Sometime after that, we should be able to do a workshop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Again, the e-mail we ask if you want to and about available dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Also, the Slope and Hillside Task Force is coming close to finishing their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| They're actually holding a public hearing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| and I'd like to start scheduling a workshop on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| and we'll need to work with Mr. DellaVope on timing for that, figure out when the best time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| We'll get an e-mail about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Also, some questions raised about our understanding of the Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| and a suggestion of spending some time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| I want to suggest that we take some time at our council dinner on September 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| to get a quick refresher course on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Mr. Swanson has said he can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and I want to let folks know that we'll be doing that on September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Mr. Mayor, I just want to thank you and my colleagues for all the support that all of you have given me, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| through these last 14 weeks and to let everyone know that I am on the men's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and do plan to be at the remaining council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| But, again, not only to you folks, but also all the citizens out there that have shown so much support to not only myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| but my family, I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Mr. Mayor, I might add that if anyone wants to find a good diet, Dwayne can give them one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| It's a very painful diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| I've offered, actually, to give him some of the weight back if he would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=710)|

| 0:12:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=729)|

| 0:12:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=734)|

| 0:12:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| 9A, a resolution to amend Chapter 5 of the City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| so as to authorize residents to keep limited numbers of domesticated chickens on a non-commercial basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Melissa, did you pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| I have copies of the ordinance that you have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| However, those portions that we amended to include are in red, so it will help you follow, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| And then also, anybody in the public who would like a copy of the ordinance, there are copies up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| I did, before we move on to people who are going to speak to this issue, I wanted to just read again the purpose of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| It's always good to know what we're talking about or at least to remind ourselves about what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| The purpose of this section is to provide standards for the keeping of domesticated chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| It is intended to enable residents to keep a small number of female chickens on a non-commercial basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| while limiting the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| The City recognizes that adverse neighborhood impacts may result from the keeping of domesticated chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| as a result of noise, odor, unsanitary animal living conditions, unsanitary waste storage and removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| the attraction of predators, rodents, insects, or parasites and non-confined animals leaving the owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| This section is intended to create licensing standards and requirements that ensure that domesticated chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| do not adversely impact the neighborhood surrounding the property on which the chickens are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| So that's the purpose of the ordinance that we are going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| I did want to amend the, I have one amendment that I wanted to make, so I think this might be a good time for me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| If you'll go to the third page of the copy that Melissa just passed out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=869)|
| 0:14:39| third page, which is Section 2, Letter B, Permit Required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=879)|
| 0:14:49| The red paragraph or the sentence that begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| As a condition of issuance of the permit, all the way down to if necessary, it's in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| I'll go ahead and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| As a condition of issuance of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| the animal control officer shall have the right to enter the permitted property during reasonable daylight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| to inspect the hen enclosure and conditions of the animals in the enforcement of this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| and shall have the authority to enter the property at any time in case of emergency or health threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| and to remove chickens from the premises if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I completely understand why this was initially brought forward and included as an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| but it is my understanding that, and the law department would need to tell me if you agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| is it your opinion that we already have in our code everything that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| that animal control has sufficient authority to accomplish what this was hoping to reinforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=943)|
| 0:15:52| We do have an existing section, and it's in 5-6 of our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| and we have looked at that and it does pass constitutional muster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| by requiring notice to the property owner before an inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| unless there's a situation where there is a violation of the law occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| and that is viewed and committed in the presence of the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| So our existing section is consistent with other cities and it is constitutionally valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| And then also at the end of the ordinance, L, denial, suspension or revocation of permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| it says a permit to keep domesticated hens may be suspended or revoked by the animal control board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| where there is a risk to public health or safety, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| So given that, I move to amend this ordinance by removing that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Okay. Right now then the motion on the floor is to remove the second sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| and it's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| That's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Okay. Speaking to that, Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Debbie, is this legal the way it's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| It would be my opinion that there would need to be specific findings of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| to bolster the legality of any proposed such amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| This gets into more of an area of a warrantless type of inspection, and based on our research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| the council would need to establish a substantial governmental interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| for this being a health or safety type concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| There must be an establishment that the inspection is necessary to further some regulatory scheme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| that you established through your findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| and the inspection program must be very specific in terms of its time, place, and scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| So all three of those factors would need to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and specific findings made by the council to bolster the legality of this type of inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1078)|
| 0:18:09| as is in the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Okay. We have a motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| We do also have two folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| But we can go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Right now we're going to vote to amend and then go back to the speakers unless someone stops me on that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Okay. All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| We better do a roll call real quick. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Okay. So it passes five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Now the motion is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Now I'm going to go ahead and go to the speakers to hear from them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Speaking in favor is Chad Helwinkel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Chad, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Chad Helwinkel, 1625 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| I'm happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| It might be the last and final and hopefully successful reading of this ordinance that allow Knoxville citizens to keep a few hens in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| You're probably all aware of the timeliness of this issue, this week in specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Currently there are over a half a billion eggs that have been recalled due to salmonella poisoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Although backyard hens will not completely eliminate the chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| every scientific study in the last five years has shown that cage-free eggs have a much lower probability of salmonella infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| In fact, in 2010 a study found that caged industrial hens are seven times more likely to carry salmonella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| So at that, let me once again quickly review the reasons for you guys hopefully passing this ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| People can take responsibility for their own health by raising eggs shown to be high in omega-3s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| lower in cholesterol, and less risky for salmonella infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Hens are an excellent tool for turning food scraps into high-value compost and fertilizer for the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1218)|
| 0:20:26| Hens can strengthen community ties through sharing of eggs and hen-keeping knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Hens can also create local green jobs through the construction of chicken coops or hen care lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| And backyard hens will help our children connect with where their food actually comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| So our goal in this whole process was to have clear rules on how hen raising will be done in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| We believe this ordinance has accomplished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And if we pass this tonight, I would say I'm proud of our work and your work and everybody's work on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| I think we have done a good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So at that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Jamie Rowe. Jamie, if you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| At our July board meeting, Fountain City Town Hall voted to oppose the domestic chicken ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| Several reasons were cited for the opposition, including concerns regarding chicken-borne illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| vermin that could potentially be a problem, larger predators being attracted to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| the fact that in cities, homes are much closer, especially in some of the older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| The production, accumulation, and disposal of waste from the chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| as well as the impact of this waste on the stormwater system of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| The fact that most hens do not start to lay until they're about six to eight months old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| The fact that breeders use extra light and must have the right conditions for the chickens to produce eggs daily or every second day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1322)|
| 0:22:12| Additionally, another important reason for opposition is that hens lay consistently for about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| Then the egg quantity decreases considerably or can't even cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| What is to become of all these hens after they no longer lay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| Sometimes chickens also need to be vaccinated for fowl pox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| This disease is carried by mosquitoes and is a more serious problem in the southern regions of the United States where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| Who will monitor and verify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| If your birds get the bird flu, then it must be reported to the county's Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Will the chicken owners know how to recognize symptoms of any of these illnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| It can be very difficult to find an avian vet that specializes in chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| We also voted to ask council in the event of this ordinance passing that all of Councilman Della Volpe's amendments be added to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1383)|
| 0:23:13| We think this is especially important because with responsibility, with rights come responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| You don't let your children just have a car and drive without insurance or without things to protect the other people on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| And there's a lot of people out there that are not going to have chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| We thank you for your consideration for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| They'll speak in favor, have a two-minute response if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Don't have to, but if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| This may address some of her concerns that talking to the group of hen advocates in the Knoxville Urban Hen Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| we're ready to go from this political advocacy to actually education and teaching classes and how to do it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| and how to abide by the rules of the ordinance laid out very clearly in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| So if this passes tonight, the first thing we're going to do is update the Web site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| and start organizing classes to teach people how to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Okay, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Mr. Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Mr. Helwingel, before you leave, could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| You just thought you were out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| You've got somewhat 81 members in the Urban Hen Coalition, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| Eighty-one members in the Hen Coalition and in Knoxville Permaculture get about 460.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| Right, but in the Hen Coalition there's 81, and some of those are not even living in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| They are outside of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, I think there is a couple in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| And under this ordinance, you can get a permit and not have to take the educational courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| or use that information that you are, you know, gratefully making available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Anyone can get the permit and follow the steps under the permit without getting additional education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| You did make a statement earlier that with the recent salmonella scare that having urban chickens might avoid that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1509)|
| 0:25:19| but the reality is that salmonella is an illness that lives in the intestines of these creatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| and is part of the fecal matter, and handling the birds can get you the contamination on your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| It's on the eggs, and unless you take proper precautions, you can catch that illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Okay, and so it's important, obviously, for people to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I want to ask Mr. Donaldson a question along the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Are you familiar with any deed restrictions, property restrictions, neighborhood restrictions on no farm animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| I don't know of any specific subdivisions in the city that have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| but I am aware that in other locations that I've worked, we've encountered deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| that prohibited all agricultural activities or farm animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| Is it possible that there are deed restrictions out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| I just don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| I just have to look into all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| And I guess if a neighborhood or an area wanted to, they could possibly pursue some type of an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| or some prohibitive alternative in the way of a deed restriction if they wanted to go through some sort of a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1588)|
| 0:26:38| civil process otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| It would be possible for a neighborhood to collectively deed restrict their property against the keeping of domestic chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1600)|
| 0:26:50| Okay, I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Mr. Donaldson, and I guess Ms. Poplin, Mr. Swanson, quick question about process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| My understanding is that when we adopt this, what we have said is that it's legal to keep chickens in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| but we still need to amend our zoning code to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| I'd like to offer an amendment someplace in this to actually ask MPC to start the process of changing the zoning code to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1635)|
| 0:27:26| And my sense, Mr. Woodall, is to suggest some language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| and I guess it would be in the whereas clause, or no, it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| It would actually have to be in the, well, Mr. Swanson might have to answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Some language asking them to allow chickens in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Does that feel legitimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| My recommendation is just to look Mr. Donaldson in the eye and say, would you please look at that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Does that feel good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| To do that without an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Does that feel good, Mr. Woodall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| But you're saying after we either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Assuming you pass the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| If you don't pass the ordinance, there's probably very little reason to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| And are we sort of in agreement that what we want to do is ask residential zones to be the places where this is allowed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Over the last two days, I've had a number of phone calls and e-mails from realtors who suddenly realized that this was coming to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1697)|
| 0:28:27| but they are concerned about the impact on property values and the fact that the real estate market is not booming at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1707)|
| 0:28:36| nor in the immediate future, that this could have a very negative impact on people who would want to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| They would not want one just where chickens have been raised or where there are hens on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| and this would be a potentially negative economic impact on the economy of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| And I do think that we need to seriously consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| And I also want to add that some years ago when I taught economics, we used the term opportunity cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| And with everything that we do, there is a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| There is something that we have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| And if you live in the city, you typically have neighbors that are on adjacent property less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1756)|
| 0:29:26| And with this ordinance, we're allowing 10 feet from the abutting property if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| And I'm very concerned that that is not a good cost for people on either side who do not want to address or deal with the hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1773)|
| 0:29:42| We talk about the purpose of this ordinance is to create standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| and yet we clearly acknowledge that there can be adverse neighborhood impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| I've heard the representatives of the Hen Coalition speak to the fact that this can help neighborhoods come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| From the feedback I've been getting from several neighborhood organizations, this can also be a very divisive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| We have problems right now with people who have neighbors with dogs that run loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| and they're unwilling to talk to the neighbor about the dog because they don't want to have some kind of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| I think that same kind of issue will emerge with the hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| And I'm not saying we don't have problems with dogs and cats because we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| I think this is just adding one more to the plate of animal control with the fees that are required to get the permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1823)|
| 0:30:32| without being nearly enough to compensate for the cost of the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Councilman Woodhull, along the lines of Councilman Palmer's bringing up the positioning of the hen houses and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| you know, I know we talked about side yards last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| And I guess some properties don't even have a backyard, so that's why it's allowed anywhere except front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| But was there any discussion about how you could position the hen houses where they would least impact the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| neighbors and, you know, maybe centering hen houses or something along those lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| Because, you know, I kind of made a mistake early on thinking that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| if somebody were going to put a hen house in their backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| they would probably get the approval of their adjoining neighbors, but that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| So in thinking about how you could try to prohibit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| putting a hen house ten feet from somebody else's house, was there any discussions about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| the concern of where they would be positioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Councilman Bailey, there was, and that's where we came up with ten feet from the abutting property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1906)|
| 0:31:54| I mean, there was some pushback on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| people wanted to be able to have hen houses or enclosures right up to their property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| and that was not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Additionally, as you pointed out, we added hen houses and enclosures should not be permitted in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| Is there anything else we could do to improve the language to try to take away some of those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| from people that don't want hens, period, and they want them as far away from their house as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| Is there any way we could put some language in there to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I mean, animal control did, I don't want to speak for animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| but what I heard them say is they didn't necessarily want design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| They wanted to focus more on the safety and care of the chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| and then based upon that, they could shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| I don't quite know if, you know, if someone is living next door to somebody who has chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| and they feel like it's intrusive to their space, it's very possible it's not meeting the guidelines that are outlined here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| and, of course, they would call and animal control could look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| So there is an inspection that would ensue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| How does that feel to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I mean, give me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| You know, here again, I made a mistake in kind of visualizing what it would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| and I thought, you know, if I had hens or what have you, I would ask for approval first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and secondly, I would send them right in the middle of my yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| probably close to my house to get them as far away from everybody else as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| just probably like a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Those situations that I've observed are clean and orderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| You know, it's not all green acres like you have in your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| It's very orderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| As a matter of fact, this ordinance has, now that it has been at least made public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| some people were unaware that they were illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| and now there's many people who are being challenged because they clearly are not complying with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| Let me just say this, that I became aware there are a lot of people with hens already in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| so this will make that legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| but one of the things that they did was they put them as far away from their neighbors as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| They kept them away from their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| They were concerned that their neighbors might have a problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| and basically could call animal control or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| so that's along the same line I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, I do want you to know that I'm also concerned about what you're bringing forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| and also the scenarios that Councilman Palmer has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Councilwoman Palmer has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I have no doubt some of those scenarios will unfold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| but I think there will be a larger good that we will notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Along the lines with Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| and Debbie, I think I sent this to you where I don't know if the rest of you were aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| because of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| but I had asked whether or not we could add something to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| that said that you had to have the approval of the adjoining neighbors if, in fact, this were to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| And I think, Debbie, you had written something about that, if you want to share that with the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| Our conclusion on that was that that would not be permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| because that's giving the neighbors the police power that the city holds to control on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| So our conclusion was that you could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Could a neighborhood collectively do that as far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| They could perhaps maybe do something, as I think Mark was alluding to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| some kind of deed restrictions and subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| but it's just not something we could include within our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| How would that process work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| On an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| No, as far as a deeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| That would just be something that would be left to the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| Even then you'd be grandfathered in, right, and you couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| The neighborhood association couldn't pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Yeah, likely so, and that would not be anything the city would enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| or that could even attempt to enforce in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| That would be left to the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Yeah, I guess it's actually very related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| It's related to the questions I had earlier about a next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| One of the challenges we get with laws like this that are not in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| is that they apply citywide, and interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| I mean that idea of ten foot from the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| there are lots in my neighborhood that are 40 foot wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| and if you have to be ten feet from each side, you've got a real narrow strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| you are in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| There are properties in your neighborhood that are probably two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| So what this does is being citywide, it sets a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| One of the things we might think about and we might want to contact MPC about at some future date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| is looking at some things we have now in R1 and R1HK that is in process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| and in R1EN to kind of look at different zoning regulations for different sized lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| and we might want to think about using that as a tool to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I mean in R1EN, the minimum lot size is 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Donaldson, am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| For any property not previously planted, it would be about a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| For replats, it's the average of adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| So this has very large lots and could have potentially larger setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| I guess it could also be something to think about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| is there a zoning overlay that would prohibit hens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| And I don't know if that's legal, but it's a thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| It could potentially be a better tool if there was a solid neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| deciding they didn't want it in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| That could be a way to do that, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| And I guess that would be something to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| and I'm always concerned about sort of vague requests that go to MPC of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| maybe you ought to do this, maybe you ought to not do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| which is sort of why I'd like some of this to be written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| so that MPC knows what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| So I'm going to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| At the moment, I'm not going to make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Councilman Dela Balby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Yes, well, I wanted to address two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| One was in response to Councilman Grieve's question and Ms. Poplin's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| I have something from the Internet that lists at least, just on quick glance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| at least three jurisdictions that have required immediate neighbor approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| of having hens on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| and that's Lynn, Massachusetts, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and St. Paul, Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| I think there was another one in here, but I haven't gathered it looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| So there are jurisdictions that are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Whether that's appropriate or not is a policy question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| but I think legally other jurisdictions have tackled that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| I have something from the Internet that says there's life on Venus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| but I'm not sure if I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Well, but these are summaries of laws, Council, and you know that people do put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, they're summaries of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Are they appellate court decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| I don't think Ms. Poplin has appellate court decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| She hasn't shared with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Actually, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I think she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| What is it then, Ms. Poplin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| It's American Chariot versus City of Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| It's a 2004 Tennessee Court of Appeals case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Similar situation of permitting of horse-drawn carriages within so many feet of a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| and it would be allowed if restaurants agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| And that was challenged on the grant on those grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| and the court held that the consent provision constituted the impermissible usurpation of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| inherent police power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| So that's what we based our conclusion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Well, you didn't share that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Thank you for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| The second thing I wanted to pass out was some information that I obtained from the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| from Mr. Hellwinkle's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| And you can see, I think from these photographs, I'll pass two that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| and ask you guys if you'll pass two sets that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| You can see that these are existing hen houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| and it may be fine on those particular properties because they probably have big lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| and maybe they're in, what, out-of-the-way areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| But on some of these small inner-city lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| you can see that the hen houses and the hen yards are pretty informally kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| that the area tends to be denuded of any grass because if you've ever watched chickens feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| they kick the ground and try to stir up little bugs and things to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| And so they're, like any other animal pen, it's pretty much raw dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And the second thing is you'll see that the materials that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| don't quite match the lofty language that we have in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| They're kind of homemade pens using, you know, some cinder blocks and a few pieces of plywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| And nothing wrong with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| but if the question that comes up is the one that Ms. Palmer raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| is are we affecting or potentially affecting property values and other homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I think you have to consider that just because you can see that these are informal-type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| And maybe someone will stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| well, dog owners have, you know, dog pens that aren't pretty either, and that's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| But I'm just saying that don't expect a Taj Mahal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Now, I will say that there is one gentleman that had a posting on the Urban Hen Coalition site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| that actually built kind of a Victorian mansion or something for his hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| And I don't have that picture with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| but if you go visit that, you'll see that you can be creative in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| But you might have just a little piece of chicken wire and a little plywood wall there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| So there is a chance to impact your neighbors, and I think we need to bear that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I think that one of the things that all of us as council folks need to realize is what is it that we want our city to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| And I think philosophically I have a problem with the fact of having chickens in the city or hens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| I know that, you know, you have rural areas and you have urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| You have the city and you have the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| And I think that one of the things that we need to look at is, overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| in terms of what we really want the vision of our city to be and what we think it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| And I think also that we have to realize there's 185,000 people living in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| And I know when I decided to move into the city, I wanted to move into an area where people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| had pretty much the same ideas in terms of what the city ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| And I find it a little difficult, and maybe I'm just philosophically opposed to the idea of having any kind of farm animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| You know, if we start talking about chickens, are we then going to start talking about goats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| What's next in terms of what we might have in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And so I think that we need to really think in terms of what a city is and what a city ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| and what a county is and what a county ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So I think that's one thing that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| I do want to commend the Urban Hen Coalition for the work that they've done and what they've put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| but I just don't – I personally do not feel that it's appropriate for a city to have hens in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I guess, Mr. Greve, it is good to have you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| And interestingly, while you were gone, you missed – we did approve goats, so it's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| That was for a special reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Well, it was a special reason, but we now allow goats in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| But I don't think you allow goats in someone's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| We don't allow goats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Well, yeah, if you back up on a park, you can have goats in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| So there is some of that that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| But you're – oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Yeah, move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| But I think you're absolutely right about a philosophical question, you know, about what is a city, what's our vision for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| And I think it's a good admission to say some of us are going to disagree on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| I have to say, when I first heard this idea, I thought, man, I haven't heard an idea that stupid in quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| And the more I thought about it and the more I thought about what my vision for the city was is it did fit with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| because I think it does get us something that's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| You know, we're not a sterile city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| We're a lively city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| We had an interesting debate a couple years ago about roadblocks to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| It was kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| This sort of came on a philosophical, what do we want our city to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I think it's fair to say that's a reason to vote for or against this, and it's an important admission to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| And I think you also have to admit that that doesn't make the people who disagree with me bad people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| or the people who disagree with you bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| We just differ a little philosophically, and I'm glad you made that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| We're going to move back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| I'm sorry, Mr. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| I'll just say one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| I think this is one of those things that we can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| If it doesn't work, we can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| And I do think that there are ways that areas, sections, neighborhoods can protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2709)|
| 0:45:18| There's varying views across the city on this, and I think that they do have alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Seeing no other lights, we're going to move to the vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| I'll go ahead and do a roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Councilman Dela Bope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| The motion passes as amended, five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| It's Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| This is when I look at Mark and ask him to, what am I asking him to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| Look at, it was a real elegant, elegant statement that Charles had prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| Will you look at the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Will you restate to me what you're going to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| We've already announced that we will look at it upon passage if that were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| And look at it in what way so everyone understands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Well, currently in the residential zone districts, there is a prohibition against poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2799)|
| 0:46:48| An easy way to address it would be simply to amend that prohibition and allow it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| conformity with the new regulations that you passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| We also have the tool of use on review that we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| We're also looking at some other urban agricultural issues in a broader context that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2821)|
| 0:47:13| triggered by the community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| And then will this deliberation come back to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Any amendment to the zoning ordinance is done by the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| We simply make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| So we will start the process and consider an array of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Mr. DelBobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| I just wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson, in your looking process, please pay special attention to those high-density zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| We have some of those planned residential zones that have five, seven, nine units per acre or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| And that certainly would be an area where you might have some concern about too close proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| where you can't isolate neighbor impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| So pay attention to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| But I'm sure you'll have public input at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| There may be different zones where the issue is more iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I want to actually disagree with Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| It won't be the first, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| It won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| We're the last, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| And I guess partly my concern is with it sort of becomes a question of how do we manage MPC's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| It's real easy for us to say, look at this, look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| It almost feels to me like I'm real concerned about all the work MPC has, all the stuff they have on their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| I don't want to ask them to do a whole lot more than look at stuff we have not talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| I don't want them sitting back and making sort of suggestions, here are 10 or 12 things you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| using a lot of their very limited staff time until we've decided what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| And while I agree with you, I don't think the process of the question you're raising starts with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| I think it has to start with us, that we've got to decide, do we want some of those things that limit it more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| and then we ask MPC to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| And it's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| I don't necessarily disagree with you on what you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I don't know if the proper way to have MPC operating is for council people to say, gee, look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| because there's a cost for them looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| So I actually want to say to Mr. Donaldson not to necessarily do what you just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| I appreciate your comments, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| I guess my concern is we started at one time with a square footage minimum for having hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| and we took that out, I think, in the interest of simplifying and limiting to six hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| I think when we were at 12, we had so many square feet and additional square footage was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Now we're going to more of a wide-open thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| And we do have some high-density zones that have, you know, 9, 15 even units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| And you're talking about people living in fairly close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| So maybe that's all just part of the mission they have, and I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| But I do think that those places could be different in kind to a normal residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3006)|
| 0:50:16| In response, what I would almost like is for, and I know other people don't agree, but I'd say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| is for a resolution asking MPC to look at this to come to us is why I was suggesting putting some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| rather than just looking at Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| So we have sat down and said this is what we want MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| I think it makes it clear we, so it's not Nick said we should do this, and Chris said we should do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| and Dwayne said we should do this, and, you know, they run around and do a bunch of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| and it comes back to us and we say we don't like what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| I'd just like a little more concreteness and especially an agreement among council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| that we have all agreed on what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| So I think what I would almost ask is for you to put something on the next agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| or maybe for Mr. Woodhall to put something on the next agenda asking MPC to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| so we've got some clarity among the nine of us about what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| I'm fine with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| I'd be glad to draft such a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| It may be that just anybody who has something they want considered by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| if they could just send me a note or an e-mail saying that I would like MPC to consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| I could put all of those things in the resolution and then they would all be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| I agree with Mr. Becker that we really need to have a list of what we expect from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| because too often we have an idea and then they have an idea and then it gets back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| and for some reason the ideas have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| And I think it's very unfair to them to ask them to work on this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Look how long it's taken us to get to this point tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| And so I would hate for them to put their time and then we decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| well, we didn't like that color of the paper or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| So I applaud you, Mr. Swanson, for asking for input from all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| And I'm sure you'll do a fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| I've brought this up to my colleagues before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| and also I had a meeting with Mr. Martin on this subject matter that we hear in the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| that not only this council but other councils have routinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and randomly asked the MPC to do certain things and they have budget restraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| and they were just doing whatever any individual council member asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| And lots of times it would go away for 12 weeks and come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| and we're going down a path we never intended to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| And some of those issues have even held over from the last council to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| and sort of steered us, I think, in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| So I think there needs to be some sort of a budget split where 80-20 or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| and if we want the MPC to do something, we can put it in the form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| and pass it and send it to you guys and then you ask the MPC to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| and then we have some budget of our own that we can use in whatever way we want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| because I just watched this for some time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| and think we've got to have some sort of a process in place to request these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| 9B, an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923 of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| entitled An Act to Incorporate the City of Knoxville in Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| and to Define the Rights, Powers, and Liabilities of the Same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| to Fix the Boundaries of Said Municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| and to Repeal all Acts or Parts of Acts in Conflict with this Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| and all Acts Amendatory thereto by Amending Section 709, Subpart B of Article 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| of the Charter of the City of Knoxville Entitled Elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| to Amend the Minimum Number of Signatures Required for a Petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| accompanying a proposed ordinance for initiative and referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| to be at least 7% of those registered to vote in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| as of January 1 of the year in which the petition is certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| or 7,000 signatures, whichever is greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Mr. Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| I just wanted to, some of us weren't here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| so I wanted to bring us up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| We struggled with this issue mightily, and I don't know if we're done today or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| but we did struggle with how do we get something that's concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| so you know the number or you have a very discreet method of determining the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| that it's high enough so we don't have a nuisance value kind of initiative referendum law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| that puts too many things before the voters and, therefore, defeats itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| and also not so high that it makes it impossible for the private citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| to organize a few people and go out and attempt to see if the voters are concerned enough to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| And we arrived at, with some struggle, this number, 7,000 or 7% of the registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| whichever is higher, and we had a specific date so that we could know what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| because it changes from day to day as people register or leave the rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| and we had January 1 of the year in which the petition is certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| The question I want to raise, and it's a little awkward, is we have another ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| and maybe I shouldn't raise it at all, we have another ordinance, 708.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| We're talking about 709 here, which is initiative and referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| The sister provision is 708, and it deals with recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And this really wasn't on the table, but it uses that same reference we had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| of the percentage of the voters who voted in the mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| And so at some point, it may not be now, but at some point, these two ought to read sort of in tandem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| In other words, I think they're birds of a feather in terms of picking a number, making it publicly known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| having it high enough that you've got to work your tail off but not so high that it's impossible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| or you've got to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| And I don't know whether it's appropriate to amend this one, which may mess us up on the timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| or simply to take that up and it will end up being something that's heard two years' hands in the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| But I want to call that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Beyond that, I certainly support the Ordinance 9B as we have amended it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| but I just wanted to get that kind of update here on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Yes, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Actually, Mr. DeLovo, you talked about how a bunch of us weren't at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| I missed that, and I actually watched on the CC thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| And I have to say, you all had a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| I tend to think much of myself, and not being here, you all did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| I was pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| I was very pleased with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I think going into it, I don't know if I could have figured it out as well as you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| And so I want to say, you know, I'll definitely be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| My gut is that you're barking up the right tree on sort of amending the recall language as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| but it would hurt us significantly in terms of getting this on the ballot right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| It's probably something just to ask Mr. Swanson to draft up a companion ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| and know it will be coming up in two years, but go ahead and do that now would be my advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3463)|
| 0:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Mr. Swanson, is there a way to get the other one on in time as far as the timetable we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| I've thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| And the way to accomplish it, I think, with this one would be to amend this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| to include both Section 708 and 709 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| That would be a substantive amendment to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| And so if you do that and if you want it to be come before the voters this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| the only way to do that is to get it passed tonight on final reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| And the only way to get it on final reading, I think, is to further amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| If you amend it to include 708 as well, then to secondly amend it to make it an emergency ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| and pass it on emergency tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| Historically, council has been reluctant to do charter changes on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| but, I mean, that's really something for you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| No, no, it's not your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I've heard timetable and to get something on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| I mean, I'm totally, as I said two weeks ago, looking at exactly what Councilman Roddy's intent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| And that is, what is the threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| What is the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| So I'm not looking at it like a timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| And if somebody wants to, you know, tell me what timetable, I'd be interested in knowing what this has to do with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3556)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Yeah, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I agree with Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I think the intent of this ordinance was to clean up a problem in our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| not to address any specific special interest needs that might be related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| The charter, what the charter said and what our law was, as trumped by state law, were two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| And as I said the last time, I think it's important that any citizen who accesses our charter knows what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| And so that's the intent, and I don't think there's any need to do that in a hurry on a particular time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| I wanted to ask, Mayor, if anybody has signed up to speak to this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We do have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| I was going to go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| We have one person signed up to speak in favor of it, and that's the only speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| If I could have a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Yeah, that's why I was reluctant to make a motion that we start amending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| I would feel, as I think Councilman Bailey said, that I'd want the public to have a chance to see what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| and to come at another meeting and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| And I certainly don't want to ambush anyone about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| I think we want to do these things in a careful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| I just raised it because it was actually part of the discussion the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| But silly me, I didn't even make a motion to include that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| But if you read those two statutory provisions, you'll find that they even cross-reference each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| and they're sisters in the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| But let's focus on 709 since we've been wrestling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Councilman Paterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| I just want to make a point here is that I haven't been lobbied by any special interest to push this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| Neither have I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| I mean, I heard that thrown out, and certainly no one has lobbied me to hurry this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| We need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Other than just ordinary citizens, it says that it needs to be done, and I agree that it does need to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| and I think this is the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| I would love to be able to include the other, you know, that amendment, but, you know, not on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| It's awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I just would not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I wouldn't be for it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| So I just want to say, you know, I'm not trying to push anything through because of any special interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| The only persons that I've heard from is just, you know, general citizens out there, not special interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Mayor Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| Just a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Simply put, I support the compromise standard that this body voted to approve two weeks ago, five to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| The standard sets an attainable and reachable goal of seven percent of the registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| or 7,000 signatures, whichever is larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| The point of referendum petitions is that they allow citizen voters of a given area to address their government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| when their government is not listening to the people on issues that impact their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| To set a standard any higher would effectively prohibit average citizens from attempting such an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| In the last 39 years, there has been exactly one successful petition ballot referendum in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3765)|
| 1:02:55| It was the hotel referendum in which Mr. Haney spent close to $250,000 to make that effort successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| It was only successful because he hired a PR firm and a signature collection company that covered the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| with representatives for weeks, as anybody that was here knows, collecting signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| Mr. Haney collected over 25,000 signatures for that effort, and it was successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| The seven percent compromise is attainable and will allow average citizens the ability to address the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| according to laws that have, quite frankly, been on our books for at least 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| Please do not vote to make referendum efforts attainable only to groups that raise hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| to push their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I ask you to vote to restore the rights of the voters of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| And I would add that it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I think somehow when folks attend city council meetings or maybe watch these events on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| and when we hear discussions like what we witnessed a couple of weeks ago and tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| they think that simply by allowing this initiative to go to ballot, then it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| Well, the fact of the matter is it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| The voters of Knoxville still have to vote to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| And if the voters of Knoxville don't agree that the seven percent standard is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| then quite frankly it will not pass in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| And that's what we ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Please allow this to move forward as written with no amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| And I will address one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| Councilman Bailey referenced the timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| The timetable was just a matter of dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| Without passing this tonight, it will not make the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| And the citizens of Knoxville will have to wait two more years before this issue is corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| to allow them to redress their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| That's the only timetable that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| And I appreciate the time to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| And please vote to approve this as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Comments from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Mayor, I have some data that I'd like to share with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| I will pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| And one of the things that our speaker referenced just now was historically what our standard was in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| under our charter before state law trumped our number in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| And if you'll look back at these election totals, what they show, this is data from the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| and they show the number of votes cast in the mayoral elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And as you all know, the previous standard and what our charter says now is 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| The signature threshold is 30 percent of the votes cast in the recent mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| And prior to 1987 when state law trumped that, all of those mayoral elections were hotly contested elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| and the voter turnout was about 30,000 votes, round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| And so if you take 30 percent of 30,000, again, round numbers, about a third, you're at about 10,000 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| That's only 10 percent of the registered voters in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Last week, the compromise that I offered, or two weeks ago, the compromise that I initially offered was 10 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| And when I brought this item to the council for consideration, I started with the 15 percent simply because that's where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3984)|
| 1:06:34| Although it's not what it said in the charter, state law in 1987 trumped our charter, and that's where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| So I felt like that was the place to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| It wasn't necessarily my recommendation, but it was certainly a place to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| I still feel like 10 percent is a better place to walk that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| We talked a lot two weeks ago about the need to have balance in this, that a government by referendum becomes very inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| It's not a responsible way to govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| And quite frankly, it can hamstring the efforts that the majority of the citizenry may want to see go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| On the other hand, we also talked about the necessity of having a method by which citizens can redress their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| So it's that balance that we struggled with two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| And, you know, if there's concern that for 40 years we had a threshold that was successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| then I would argue that 30 percent of 30,000 votes, which historically has been about the voter turnout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| and again in 2003 when we had a mayoral election, about 30,000 votes were cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| I think it was a little bit more than 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| And a third of that, 30 percent of that, would be 10,000 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| So I'm not comfortable with the 7 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| I think it errs too far on one side of this balancing act that we're trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| And I would like to make a motion to amend to 10 percent of the registered voters in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| I see that light, but this would be speaking to the motion to amend at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| Okay, Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Yes, two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| One is, as I recall, the original information that Ms. Roddy gave out showed a later election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and it was probably the 2007 or 2008 election, and the 30 percent of the voters was about 2,000 people, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4098)|
| 1:08:26| So it ranged, and I think you said in 2003 it was 8,500 voters or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| So it ranged from 2,000 to 8,000 in the last ten years, or the last two elections we've had, and not the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4113)|
| 1:08:42| The second thing, and I want to emphasize this, is that anyone who's attempted this as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| knows that you don't take this on lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| It is really a hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| And if you can picture a sheet of paper with a name and address and a printed name and the voting precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| and all that information that you have to have on this, as well as the description of the item you're asking them to sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| and you stand there in front of a store or in the market square for a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| and you, the individual worker, get four full sheets filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| There's about 25 signatures on a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| You've got 100 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| It takes a lot of work, and I'll tell you what, you get 20 people to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| and then the next weekend you got 15, and then the third weekend you got 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| It really takes a lot of work, and you wear out volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| If citizens are going to have a voice in bringing something to the table, it has to be high enough to make them work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| but it shouldn't be so high as to really discourage petitioning the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| And we ended up at 7,000 as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I think we ought to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Just a clarification, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Did you mean 10% or 10,000, which is kind of what we had been saying, or just a 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| I'm supporting this ordinance as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| I think that if we have 7,000 signatures required, actually you're going to have to have at least 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| because people will sign who are not registered to vote in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| A spouse may sign for them, so the kick-out rate is fairly high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| So we are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| They're going to have to collect probably 10,000 signatures if this standard stands at 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| So we're looking at that number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| The second thing, the whole concept of initiative and referendum and recall came about in the early 1900s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| when governments were not being responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| So it's incumbent upon all of us to be responsive and not put ourselves in a position to be recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| or our government in a position to need a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| When an issue comes to the voters or to the public eye for a referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| many times the referendum itself may not collect the required number of signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| or it may not pass muster with the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| but it has brought an issue into the open for good, honest discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| that people might mutter about in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| So the process is healthy when we do have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| but it's also healthy that those discussions are coming out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| In a lot of ways I agree with Ms. Palmer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| While, Ms. Rowdy, I understand your concern about where that level is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| 7,000 feels much more right to me than 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| I think it feels, as an organized group of citizens, it feels doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| but it's not so low that a paid group could come in and do it on a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| So it feels like the right number, and I'll be opposed to your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| As I said two weeks ago, when I first looked at government by referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| and some of the signature drives that were out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| when talking to the people that were gathering the signature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| I was pretty well convinced that I needed to sign those petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| and only to come find out as I became more and more educated on the subject matter I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| And I just look at some of the referendums that have passed in our county in the last many years here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| and if you've looked at them and studied them and see what they mean to our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| and to the process itself, it turned out to probably be a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| I think that the standard needs to be high, and it ought to be difficult to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| because we have somewhere around 100,000 voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| and the potential to get signatures I think is a lot easier if the issue is of substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4361)|
| 1:12:50| If you have a council that is elected that ignores the public and passes bad laws and ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| every two years we have an election, and you can vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| But I do think there ought to be some way to recourse or some sort of appeal, but it ought to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4384)|
| 1:13:12| And if you have bad decisions being made or a bad issue out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| I don't think it's that difficult to mobilize volunteers to go and get signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| And even when some of the people you talk to that are getting these signatures, they could easily mislead you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| and, you know, your name is on a signature, your signature is on there, and you get the number, it's on the referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| And as my computer went out, I was going to read a portion of an email from someone I highly respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| that addresses the time they take to educate themselves and to look into what are on these referendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4423)|
| 1:13:55| They really just don't take the time to educate themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| And I think it's, you know, if you pass something like, for instance, on this HEN ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4438)|
| 1:14:07| if we pass something and we decide it needs to be amended, then we can bring it forward and we can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| If you have something that passes by referendum, it has to go back on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| It has to go back on referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| You can't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| You can't amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| You can't do anything to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| It has to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| You have to go out and get the signatures, and you have to overturn it to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| In terms of redress or recourse, our federal constitution of the United States has no redress or recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| Our state has no recourse or redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| I just think that, you know, all the time that we've spent to go out here and to knock on doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| and to talk to people and to get elected, that we should not pass off these issues that come before us to a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4486)|
| 1:14:55| We ought to take a position and stand on it, and if people don't like it, they'll vote us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| But I do think that, you know, it ought to be 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I agree, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| And it ought to be at 10 percent of the registered voters because there's a lot of potential to get signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Mr. Gilliland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Yeah, let me just respond briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| The section TCA, that's the Tennessee Code annotated, TCA section 2-5-151, deals with these kinds of petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4518)|
| 1:15:30| This is the petitions for recall referendum initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| And the state law requires you to put the full text of the question that the voters are being asked to sign on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4535)|
| 1:15:43| So if you don't know what you're signing, it's because you didn't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| And maybe people can talk you into signing something, but I'll tell you that their standards are high in terms of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| And I think someone already mentioned, you'll find someone will have signed it and then, well, we really move to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| and their address record won't match what's on file in the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| And as Brenda said, some of these are going to wash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| But state law requires you to tell them what it is they're signing by giving them the text of the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| I don't think we should be afraid of the voters getting to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| So I'm still for the petition as laid out with 7,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| One of the reasons why I think 10 percent is a reasonable threshold is it does eliminate confusion in a community where we have two governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4586)|
| 1:16:36| And as you all will remember, in August, the county charter was amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| and the threshold was lowered from 15 percent of the registered voters to 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Now, granted, it's 10 percent of a much larger number in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| but I think there's some parity there that lessens confusion for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| In response to some of my colleagues' comments about citizens having a voice and government being responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| I think that that is the role of elected officials is to be responsive to the folks that elected them and brought them to this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4621)|
| 1:17:09| and to give citizens a voice through the deliberations that take place in these chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| That doesn't mean, again, that there doesn't need to be a safety valve of some kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| but I think that safety valve needs to be crafted in a way that it's achievable but difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| It shouldn't be something that can be accomplished in a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| It should take some significant effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| And I think the point that Councilman Bailey made, if you'll look at your ordinance on the very last page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4652)|
| 1:17:40| and I guess the pages aren't numbered, but on the front side of the last page, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| the language does say that on these petition referenda, if a majority vote in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| the ordinance shall become a binding ordinance, and any ordinance proposed by petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| or which shall be adopted by vote of the people cannot be repealed or amended except by vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| And that's where you get into this possibility, this phrase that people throw around about government by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| So one referendum passes, and then another group of people decide that's really not the direction we should have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| Well, that can't be changed unless another petition drive happens and another referendum goes on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| And, you know, it can bring good policy and good government to a grinding halt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| So I simply cannot support any threshold less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| I'm going to support what is brought before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| One of the reasons is I would invite all of you all to go back, I forget how many years ago it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4716)|
| 1:18:44| and watch the deliberation that this very body had on Melissa Mayfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| And it was one of the greatest injustices that this city ever endured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| And there was talk at that time of a recall, which dovetails off this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| But, you know, then it just lost steam because it was too daunting a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| I mean, it was practically right status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| And it just, you know, it just wasn't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| If there's ever a time, then that was probably one of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| So I'll just invite you to watch that deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| I hesitate to speak, but I wanted to answer one thing that Councilman Roddy raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| And that is, on its face, the ordinance says that one of the options that the council has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| is to pass the ordinance when presented with the certified petition with all the signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| and in which case it short circuits the whole referendum process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| So it puts it right on the table in front of the council to deliberate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| and to have the kind of discussions that you say we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| And I think that that's the first option in that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| The second is if we don't act, then it goes to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| So I think it's kind of a slap upside the head to get your attention that this is important enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| that a substantial number of voters want you to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| And I think that's a healthy provision we have where the council tackles the question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| One more thing I wanted to mention is, you know, we already have a legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| to put something on a referendum, and that's this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| And if the public want us to put something on as a referendum, they can come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| and here again we can deliberate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| And I think that hotel referendum was so cumbersome and onerous that, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| didn't the council vote to put it on by referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| That's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| So, I mean, we've already got a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| So if the council and the mayor and the administration and what have you is bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| and the public is upset with issues, then they can come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| If we won't do it, then it ought to be big enough and sizable enough that the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| and the volunteers will come forward and get the signatures, and I don't think it will be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Let me just make real, and this is a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Again, as I said last time, it does come down to kind of your theory of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| I do have a few concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Number one, and a point I think that Joe made is a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Every two years, half of this council comes up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| That's about as great of a citizen redress as you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I mean, that's every two years, one time four, the next time five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| The second thing I think I'd point out is, you know, in national or state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| there's no process like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| You don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| And so there is in local governments, but if you look at most local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| I haven't done a comprehensive study, but most of them are at the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| I think the third thing is, look at the county, the items that were on the county ballot last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| some of the referendum items there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| And I haven't done this, so I'm making a wild guess, but I bet if you go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| a whole lot less people voted on those issues than voted in the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| People that just read all that go, I don't know what they're talking about, and didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| So there is, I know we say people do, and a lot of people did a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| and asked people and did the hard work to be informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| but a whole lot of folks don't when that comes up on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| I think the fourth thing that I'd say is, this actually is a very responsible form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| If you think about, in what other form of government do folks get to come and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| express opinions for and against and then have a chance to rebut and then get up at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| There's no more responsible form of government than local government as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| And we see that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| There's folks out here in the audience that come frequently to exercise their right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| and they get the right to be heard, and it impacts them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| We all know it impacts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| So to think that we don't have responsible government now, I think is just a far cry from what we experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| So I'm with those who favor the higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| I mean, either way, I mean, obviously, you know, we'll carry out what you vote on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| but in my mind, and I guess the other last point, you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| well, we don't want to be where just where people who can raise the money to pay people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| Well, remember, that just means that, you know, other folks can raise money to pay and to get them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| And I know in the hotel deals, I know it has to be on the ballot and has to be read just that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| but I was running in that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| I was at a lot of the early voting sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| and I know a whole lot of people signed that petition that didn't really know what they were signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| because somebody was being paid to get their signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| So there is a danger there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| We'll go ahead and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5001)|

| 1:23:30| Is it to amend to 10 percent or 7,000 or to 10 percent as an absolute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| 10 percent period is what Ms. Roddy said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5015)|

| 1:26:49| Mr. Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| I just wanted to point out for members in the audience who may not know, we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| when we deal with a zoning issue, make sure that the one-year plan and the other pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| of our zoning ordinance are intact, the sector plan, before we actually change the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| and so we're going through these one at a time, but that is the process we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| through now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| First, this is in my district, and I want to take an opportunity, I think most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| know, is I generally don't mind when other council people have opinions about stuff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| I know some district people are very sort of tight about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| I'm very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| I actually appreciate that kind of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I think it makes a better decision when we all get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| I want to actually just raise a question about this in relation to the ongoing debate right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| now about RF4 and see whether, I mean, this feels to me, to my mind, this is, passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| This feels like something that would be an ideal use of RF4 for me, and I wonder if people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| have comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| I also want to say, and this is an argument that I think could be used either for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| RF4, is that there have been, as Mr. DellaVope is pointing out, we're on our fifth vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| this issue, and so far there's been no real discussion about doing it or not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| It's all been processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| It's all, how many votes do we have to have, and what is all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| So I think that the default of council is to approve things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| So this is one of those cases where I believe a lesser zoning change would actually help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| the neighborhoods, and I'm just wondering whether other people have thoughts about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Mr. DellaVope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| I don't want to get us on a detour, but I thought at least what the neighborhoods were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| saying was that by forcing people to challenge or change the sector plan and the zone, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| they would have notice and could respond to it, and if the default in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| is towards allowing this transition activity, then they're more likely to be cut out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| So that was my perception, at least, of the debate, but it's still going on, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| are public meetings about it, so I think we should leave those folks to hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| But that's my perception of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5350)|

| 1:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Excuse me, Mr. DelValby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Yes, I'd like to ask Mr. King, I've already talked to him once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| but do we have some tighter range of cost because you gave me a pretty broad range over the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| or by e-mail on the price per running foot of sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| I know it depends somewhat on terrain and what you run into and whether there's rock and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| But what are we looking at as an experience matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| What are we seeing our experience in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| Well, what I had given you was probably numbers that councils heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| Our experience on different projects that we have bid is that sidewalk construction varies from approximately $100 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| linear foot to $500 per linear foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| And that really varies with, like you said, the terrain, whether we have to purchase property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| whether there's a storm surge system that has to be constructed, how large that system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| There's a variety of factors that make that range pretty wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| The reason I ask that is you can't go anywhere in this city and talk to citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| and find out, I guess, the expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| They all want more sidewalks and there's a limited amount of dollars to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| And I didn't know if in our experience we're finding any economies of scale in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| whether some of it can be done in-house or maybe government is always more expensive than a private contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| But I was just curious if in looking at this issue in a broader way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| if there's some way to kind of make it easier to build more feet or miles of sidewalk, which we struggle to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5835)|
| 1:37:24| Well, I don't want you to think that we don't use our own forces to build some sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| We do do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| But typically it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| You recently did that right at the Tank Strickland Park, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| But typically the commercial bidding brings you a lower price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| Typically, because typically a contractor is more accustomed to building larger sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| What we try to use our forces for is the smaller sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| and those are the sections of sidewalk that we typically get higher prices for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| So that if you had a broken section or an area, you might go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| and repair that with your own crews as opposed to try to bid it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| We do that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Mr. Graves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| I'm just curious, how many bidders do we have for the sidewalk project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| I think there were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5895)|

| 1:38:20| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| I've been interested in, since Mr. Delover is asking, I think a lot of really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| I know I've been a long supporter of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| And interestingly, two of the groups that are really effective in pushing sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| one is the Bearden Council, and I see Ms. Faulkner in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| so I'm sure could share a lot of wisdom on how to get more sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| The other is Fountain City Connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5922)|

| 1:39:26| Yeah, I just wanted to mention, I don't think Bob Polk could make it to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| but I just wanted to acknowledge that the staff of the Coliseum and Auditorium Group that Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5969)|
| 1:39:37| and Dale Dunn did all of the painting of the walls and some of the hallways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| and the railings and all the things they could do, this contract originally had a pretty high estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| I think it was $165,000, but they were able to bid it at a time where there's hungry contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| which was good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=5994)|

| 1:41:28| I guess we're, the paperwork is following the completion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6088)|

| 1:41:36| Cindy's here, but I was thinking this one was money that could be used for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Yeah, actually it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6099)|

| 1:41:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| The previous resolution that you passed dealt with the transit center completion, and you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| It's catching up with the final piece of funding for the transit center project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6123)|

| 1:42:32| Nick, it's an old like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Oh, that was the old like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| You don't have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| Maybe Madeline could address this, but my understanding is that this is a way of taking advantage of some tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6160)|
| 1:42:48| by dealing with a private entity rather than straight to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| But I'm not sure that I'm correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| But this is a way to help us get this project funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Oh, I see that Alvin Nance is here, and maybe he can jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| I would recommend we ask Alvin to explain this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Go ahead, Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| It's his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Alvin Nance, 1735 Woodhaven Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| Yes, this is actually allowing us to be able to complete this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| We're utilizing low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| We want to sell those tax credits in the secondary market, so we needed to create a for-profit entity to hold the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| credits so that you can actually sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| As KCDC being a non-profit entity, we can't sell the credits to facilitate the financing on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| It allows us to move this project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| This is not one of the projects you're doing in the area by Walter P. Taylor so that we will have more units to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| moving people to if we go the next step over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Yes, we want to complete those units before we start demolishing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| So that we'll have places for folks to live as they're being displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6237)|

| 1:44:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| Item 12A, an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Article V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| Section 10 regarding minimum required street frontage for the installation of a changeable price sign to require a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| minimum of 100 feet of frontage on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| I'm going to let Mr. Becker lead this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| With a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| With a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| I'm going to note that there's actually nothing else on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| So I'm going to suggest that Mayor Haslam actually go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| We have four people signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| All have signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Charlotte Davis, Barbara Nicodemus, Ron Frost, and Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| I guess the easy thing to do would be just to let the women speak and not have to listen to Mr. Frost again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| But what I'd actually like, council rules allow three speakers per side for up to 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| If it's agreeable to you all, I'd like to suggest that we allow up to 15 minutes and ask you, the four of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Is that agreeable to council and to the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Then we'll do that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Ms. Davis has signed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Please come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| And I guess you each get four minutes in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| So please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| I don't think I need four minutes, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| My name is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| First, why in the world would you consider this change in the permitted use of digital changeable price signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| If you pass this amendment, it means that there could be at least 1,200 more signs in use, 163 on Broadway alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6352)|
| 1:46:04| 136 on Central, 158 on the Magnolia Asheville Highway corridor, 68 on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6364)|
| 1:46:14| 44 on the Western Oak Ridge Highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| Our city would look like a Christmas tree, a little Las Vegas at the foot of the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| It has been said that the present ordinance is unfair to small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| Well, is it fair to the citizens of Knoxville to have the potential of having our city look so garish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6392)|
| 1:46:42| So much has been done in recent years to improve the appearance of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| To approve this amendment will undo so much of the progress that has been made to enhance the attractiveness of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6408)|
| 1:46:58| Please deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| I don't think there was a wasted word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6423)|

| 1:47:12| Ms. Davis was actually very brief, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| Mine won't take five minutes either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6435)|

| 1:47:30| I would like to read a position statement in opposition to the Agenda Item 12A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| Ordinance to Reduce Minimum Required Street Footage for the Installation of a Changeable Street Time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6455)|

| 1:47:49| and strategies that enhance community appearance and livability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| We encourage the elimination of billboards and the minimization of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| As such, we urge City Council to reject the current proposal to reduce frontage distance required for digital price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| Our city has current ordinances that need to be upheld and respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| Additional signage will further distract already distracted drivers, will clutter up already too cluttered roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6492)|
| 1:48:20| and could pose a danger by limiting sight distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| Our members agree that the city should be striving to make the city safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| and beautify our urban environment, not denigrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Citizens and business owners understand the city ordinances are in place to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| and enhance the urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Therefore, we, the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| urge you to uphold city ordinances and to reject this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| And we appreciate your consideration to our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Mr. Frost, I know you're unfamiliar with speaking to the body here, but would you like Ms. Feld to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| Ms. Feld, you've been asked to precede Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Please state your name, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| And I am speaking on behalf of as president of Scenic Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| Scenic Knoxville is opposed to reducing the frontage requirements for changeable price signs from 250 feet to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| In fact, we would like to see council enact a ban on all new digital price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| Some council members have expressed concern about a level playing field for businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| and a ban would be the easiest and best way to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| More and more cities across the country are banning all forms of digital signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| and I haven't found any that have separated out changeable price signs from EMCs in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| as Knoxville's ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| Some council members have asked if Scenic Knoxville is willing to compromise on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| but allowing digital price signs with 250 feet of frontage was already a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| when the current ordinance was written last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| So, as before, our position is we would like to have a ban, which I hope you will seriously consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6618)|
| 1:50:26| and our compromise position is a minimum of 250 feet of frontage or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| Some proponents of this proposal have claimed that non-digital price signs are so old-fashioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6633)|
| 1:50:42| and so out of date that you can hardly buy them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| I submit to you photographs of Weigel's price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| This is just an example, none of which are digital, as well as the new bread box that opened recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6651)|
| 1:51:01| These signs are very visible, highly readable, and attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| They don't look out of date to me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| Businesses located next door in Farragut, as well as in the innumerable cities that have banned all digital signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| are obviously buying these signs somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| Some council members feel this is a pro-business proposal, but this is misguided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| Studies have shown that communities that enact tough signage controls enjoy strong economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| A five-year study of 35 cities concluded that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| an attractive community has a better chance at industry, including tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| We only have to look at Charlotte, North Carolina, for a good example of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| A city with strict signage control, it has become an economically vibrant city and a center of the banking industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| In the last few years, it's won innumerable awards, such as Best Place to Start a Small Business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| Best City for Entrepreneurs, Best Place to Live, Best Housing Market, and Most Educated Workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| Obviously, sign control has not been bad for business in Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| Reducing the frontage will open the door to thousands of digital price signs across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| They may not all appear at once, but they will be there eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| It will also open the door to more requests to water down an ordinance that was months in the making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| and received broad public support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| For instance, I recently saw a gas station located outside of Knoxville whose changeable price sign alternated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| about every 10 seconds between one price for credit cards and one price for cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| You can bet someone will soon contact you claiming it's a hardship not to be able to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| and they will not want to adhere to the current 60-second hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| Ten years ago, we went through nine counties, one vision initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| There was a lot of opportunity for public input, and over and over people expressed concerns about ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| and obtrusive signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| People's opinions on this subject haven't changed, and those are the same people that you represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| the people that voted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Before you vote on this proposal, I would ask you to think about how your constituents would want you to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| I feel pretty confident that I know how that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Mr. Frost, it is good to see you here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| We've missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| Rob Frost, 4752 Calumet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| That's a little more about a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| First, congratulate Councilman Bailey and his wife on the new addition to their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| And probably already been said, congratulate Mayor Haslam on another birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| Unlike my good friend, Nick DellaVoppe, don't worry, I'm going to stick to a script tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| I'll be relatively brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| My good friends at Scenic Knoxville invited me out to come out tonight to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| Four of you all know how I felt about changeable price signs, EMCs, digital billboards, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6839)|
| 1:54:07| But for those of you all who I didn't have the pleasure of serving with, it's been a long, drawn-out process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6847)|
| 1:54:16| In the beginning, you know, we had signs that a regular person would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| And then we had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| And then we had workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| And then we had things sent back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| And it went on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Throughout the process, compromise was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| I was a little less willing to compromise than some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| But nevertheless, the folks at Scenic Knoxville came to something that everybody can work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6879)|
| 1:54:47| By lowering the threshold, it's going to cause the potential for up to about 1,200 more of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6887)|
| 1:54:56| Now, people say it might be a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| But it's not anybody here tonight saying it's going to be a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Tonight is here to speak in favor of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| So is this issue really an issue that needs to be brought up again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| People don't travel to places like Asheville, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, to see blinking signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6916)|
| 1:55:25| They go for the places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| They go for the scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| They go for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| And they go for the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Some of you all may have traveled to Vail, Colorado, Hilton Head, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| I don't think you're going to find signs like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| And you find people going to those communities for their beauty, for what they can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| And just because a company is going to have signs such as this isn't going to magically make the consumer's wallet to get fatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6944)|
| 1:55:54| And they're going to rush into the store and spend more money than they have and their budget allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| I can understand the sign companies wanting to be able to sell these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| That's capitalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| That's their right to advocate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| But when you go to a city, you also want to have something that's attractive, not just for the tourists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| but most importantly the people that are there who live there, who go to work there, who lay their head at night there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| and spend their money and pay into the tax base there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| You want to have a city that is attractive, that is not distractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| and something that a citizen can feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Therefore, I'd respectfully submit that the compromise was reached last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| The compromise should stay in place, and we can get back to worrying about bigger issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Mr. DellaVopola, let me start with questions for any of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Let me start out by saying I believe we do not have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| So, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| If there is not a motion, we will declare this dead for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| And there is not a motion, so we declare this dead for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| I believe we are at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I do not see anybody signed up to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| So we stand ready to listen to Mr. DellaVopola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| I won't be as long as Mr. Frost, but let me just thank the people who came several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| and this issue was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| And I appreciate your diligence and your efforts of coming back and sharing your thoughts with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| We stand adjourned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7074)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100824?start=7104)|
