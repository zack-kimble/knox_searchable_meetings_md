| 0:34:43| And page 22 and 23 just really restate how much we've seen this market change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| It has been a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| In 2008, 30% of the deals done in the market were variable rate short-term puts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| In 2010, only 6% of the deals done were variable rate transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Similarly, if you look at this enhancement or this liquidity provider issue that we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| in 2008, 7% were done with these standby bond purchase agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| where the bank's on the sidelines willing to buy the debt if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| In 2010, only 1% of new deals done had those types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| They're few and far between and expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| So on 24, which we talked a little bit about just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| is how important credit has become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| The county's credit is more important now than it was three and four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Right now, the county sits at a AA1, which is one notch below AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| And if you look, what we've done is outlined the costs or the considerations for moving into other categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| If the county were to be in the AA category, I mean the single A category, which is the red line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| it would cost them approximately, just an approximation, of 1.1% more to borrow in the long-term market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| And similar, if you look at the BBB, which we saw DeKalb County, Georgia, fall into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| it costs them over 2% more to access the capital markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| So where we ended up, and kind of in summary of going through this analysis with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| is that the county's existing rating is extremely strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| There's been a lot of things that have helped continue to keep that rating at the level it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| and we think those should be considered going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| The county continues to be very attractive when residential homeowners try to look to a cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| It's also a consideration that that component of the property taxes associated with debt is low in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| So when you think about your peers' counties, the county's is significantly lower than the other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| and they've relied on assessments growth to handle some of that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2212)|
| 0:37:02| The recommendations that we bring to the table is a recommendation to formalize some of the policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| one of which is from the comptroller's office to actually formalize a debt policy, a decision-making policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| that will help you make those debt decisions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Also an annual review of the county's reserve fund policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and really making sure that the rating agencies are comfortable with the policies that you've developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| and adopted for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And also just going forward when making decisions related to debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| that the county takes into consideration that risk matrix or those considerations that we've outlined for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| as well as the existing debt portfolio of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and, of course, affordability associated with those considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| When you say formalized debt policy, what exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Do you have a template to look at, some things that you would suggest that this policy include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| Does the comptroller's office have something to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I guess I'm looking for some type of guidance for this formalized debt policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| Yes, sir, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| The comptroller's office has put out a few things that are mandatory to be included in a debt policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| Disclosure of costs associated whether it be interest costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| also the costs associated with outside professionals, bond counsel, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Also disclosing how you plan to structure your debt and disclosure of conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| We also think there's a lot of other things that you can include in a debt policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| to really make them a guideline for commissioners like yourself when you're making decisions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| At what level will you do a refunding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Is it 1% savings or is it 5% savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Things like that that we feel like are just helping the decision-making process when you have a formalized policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| Mr. Troyer, how soon do you think we could get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Would it take 60 days, 90 days, something to formalize this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Yes, definitely before January the 1st and maybe sometime over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| We've been monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| The state comptroller's office has offered a number of suggestions to include in a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| and we've been monitoring their suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| And we have not started the work to put the pencil to the paper and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| okay, let's talk specifically about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| And I think that's our next step through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| So by January 1, we should have something concrete that we could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| And I think the commission, this would be good to spend some time talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| and really having an interactive communication or discussion about where do we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| And I think that needs to be an element of our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Lauren, I ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| You may not know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| It might be a John Troyer question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| On our fixed outstanding debt, what's the highest interest rate that we're paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| Or John, you may know off the top of your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| We may have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Mr. Chairman, while she's looking at that, I want to congratulate Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| It looks like he's done some good work because he's been in that position for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| him and Anna Acuff and the other people on your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| I think the reason we've got some good reports is the good work you've been doing, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| And that's part of what the mayor wanted to do is to make sure that the commission is a part of these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| And he asked PFM to come as an independent objective viewpoint to be able to give some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:27| and just take a look at where are we right now and make sure that we can start a conversation about where do we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Do you find that, Lauren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I would direct you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Tab five includes, it's probably overkill, but each individual page has a piece of the county's debt on it per series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| Just kind of glancing through this, the taxable pieces of debt that you have probably in the five to six percent range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| your tax exempt pieces more along the lines of three to five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you for coming and doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| This is very helpful, and it's very understandable, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| And your specific suggestions that you had for a debt policy, you have passed along to Mr. Troyer so they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:15| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| And I look forward to hearing what you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| I think this is really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Just a couple of quick follow-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| The taxable you just mentioned, five to six range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| On the Build America's, the feds are paying a third of it, aren't they, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Thirty-five percent, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Thirty-five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| And so the other, John, if I'm wrong, it's all the pension stuff, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| It's the UOP with $54 million to fund the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| And then there was a previous one for the teachers, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Yeah, the teachers' aid pension, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| So that's the only other two taxable issues other than the Build America's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| What is, I guess maybe it's a, obviously BB&T is one of our main banks, but DEPPA, is that a consortium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| I've never heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| DEPPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| They are a bank and they focus on providing liquidity and credit, primarily associated with some of these swap transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| I've just never heard of that institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| You mentioned the third-party risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| I assume that's if we had a city bank or somebody two years ago whose credit went, got discounted significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:32| That's our third-party risk, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Or a BOA or somebody didn't necessarily fail, but had a lot of exposure in the market and got hit, took hits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| What happens with variable rate debt is it will trade not on the county's credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| but on the bank's credit that provides the liquidity status to the bondholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| So if that bank deteriorates, such as, who did we see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| SunTrust or Regions, just name it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Yeah, Regions, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| The day they get downgraded, you automatically see your interest rate exposure and cost go up the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| Sometimes some of the banks failed and those bonds went to bank bond status and you had to pay maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| You, not you, the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| But people had to pay maximum rate of 12 to 14 percent on their debt overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| So that's the credit exposure we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| And so we recommend that you, in the future, look to diversify that credit exposure profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| and also look to maybe infuse some more fixed rate debt to balance out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I see, I can, I think one of your recommendations is be very careful on the variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| If we're at 49 and they say at 50, the red flag goes up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| I hesitate to say do fixed rate because you don't know what market you're going to be in when you're ready to issue more capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| or fund more capital, but look closely at that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| Because if rates are high, that's not when you want to enter into fixed rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| But you do want to maintain some capacity to have that variable rate tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Is that when our exposure is, though, if rates were to, is that when these things all come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| if rates were to go, tax fees go to eight or nine or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| I mean, is that when these hedges are so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Well, the other thing that's happening is the hedges that you have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| the swap valuation and the termination value, as rates go higher, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| those termination values come down, so you have an opportunity to unwind those swaps at a lower cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| However, to unwind those swaps, you have to refinance them into a higher market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| So technically, you know, you're moving from one instrument to another, maybe getting out of those swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| but entering back into a fixed rate issue or a variable rate issue when rates are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| So you have to look closely at all the components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I've never been a big swap fan, but John and I have all had a lot of discussions about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| And one final question, Jefferson County, Alabama, was that the swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| is that the poster child for don't get caught in swaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| That amongst many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| There's several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| That would be the big one, though, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Yeah, actually, just to answer my question more about the swaps, too, and like Ed, I'm not a big fan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| but haven't there been some issues with counties around Knox County with swaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| We're working very closely with Blount County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Blount County was what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| We'd like to terminate their swaps, unwind them, but it's too cost prohibitive to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| So what we've done is we've set them up to monitor the cost of those on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| which we probably would suggest that we monitor yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Commissioners, I have a proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Number three, five, six, seven, eight, nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:13| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Number nine I'd like to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Let's remove number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Pardon me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| It's not nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| It's ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Oh, ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| So nine is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Ten you want to take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:53| twenty-three, twenty-seven is withdrawn, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty-six, and thirty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2813)|
| 0:47:13| Anyone like to remove any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| If not, clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Is it fourteen or ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Number ten was taken off, so we will discuss number ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Number fourteen is on consent, unless you want to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Could we take that off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| We'll take off fourteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| On page one, item number four, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| appointing to the Knox County Personnel Board, resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Commissioner Burroughs, you have a name for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Ms. Kim Weber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| And Ms. Burroughs will be getting us some information about her by the meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| So that is the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Is there a motion that we approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| We'll move it to the agenda without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I'm sorry, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| And maybe we'll wait until Monday, but I didn't know how to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| On three, I think the Mayor has promised us some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| Yes, if you'd like, we can go ahead and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Yes, it would be great to address it now, but if he wants to wait until Monday, I just don't want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| Mr. Quillen is here, I believe, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Yes, Mr. Rob Quillen is here, so if anyone would like to ask him any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| Just in general, I guess I'd like to hear, we hadn't seen a resume or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| so if you could spend 15 seconds talking about yourself, or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| and just kind of give me a feel for what you would bring to this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Although we've not utilized it, I'd like to get a feel for what you would bring to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Again, my name is Rob Quillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I've been practicing law here in Knox County for almost 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| I've been at Kennerly, Montgomery, and Finley that entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| I'm a shareholder there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I've practiced locally here in our courts primarily, almost exclusively in the civil context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| I've handled a lot of real estate cases, probate cases in front of Mr. Hogan over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| Primarily business lawsuits in a civil litigation context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| I've handled cases in front of all three of our circuit court judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| I've handled cases in all of our chancery courts, General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| I've provided a resume, and I have one here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I've provided one to the mayor's office, but I could provide that to anyone who's interested in seeing it additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Maybe we'll get it to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| If you could give a copy to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| That way she can get it out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I don't really have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| I just wanted to disclose that he is a distant cousin from my wife's side, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| We're sorry, Mr. Quillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Well, I'm married into the situation, so I have, and I'm married up, so I have no one to blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, Mr. Quillen, for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Since the time that this has been offered to us, have you, in your exposure to the code or to ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:56| what do you think about this role of sexually oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| your role as trying to be somewhat of a monitor almost of our code as a reference to this style of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| As I read the code, and I don't have any particular connection to this industry, thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:18| and have not represented clients in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| but as I read the code, this position is essentially a quasi or, frankly, a judicial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:34| I've had occasion in the past to represent some clients that were convenience store owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| that were brought up on beer board violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| They owned a number of convenience stores, and they had, from time to time, you'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| if you have a large business that sells alcohol, you'll have some violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| And the city of Knoxville has a panel of hearing officers that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| who hear allegations as to whether or not an offense was committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| and whether or not that business should have their license revoked or suspended, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| And this role, it's not an enforcement role in the sense of being an advocate for taking a license away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:20| or granting a license to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| The ordinance sets out a procedure whereby a business who wants to engage in that type of conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| which you as the commission have chosen to regulate, that business has to apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| And the county clerk, in the first instance, reviews that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| and makes a determination as to whether or not the permit should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| The clerk also, if there's information provided to the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| that the business should have their permit revoked or suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| the clerk makes that determination at the outset and, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| charges that business that your permit should be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| The hearing officer, which is this position that I've been nominated for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| is, in essence, the first legal officer to make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| as to whether or not that business is in compliance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Review the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| If the business meets all the qualifications laid out, it's a legal determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| The hearing officer then grants the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| either agrees with the clerk to deny the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| or finds that, no, the business has met all the requirements under the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| and the permit has to be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| But the hearing officer essentially acts in a judicial role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| The business and the clerk are both entitled to be represented by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| I presume the clerk will be represented by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| And the hearing officer acts as a judge based on the record that's presented to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| much like an arbitrator does in a civil litigation context, or a judge does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Then each party has the right to appeal the hearing officer on up to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| So I view it as a legal role to hear cases that come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:23| based upon the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Certainly, just as judges do in any context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| they can come back after they've got some experience in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| and provide their thoughts on the industry and the businesses that they've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| and what other policy decisions you as a commission can make as far as further regulations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:49| Mary Ann Stackhouse was the previous hearing officer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Okay. Have you talked to Mary Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I have not talked with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| As I understand it, my understanding was, and maybe I'm incorrect about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| there had been no hearings in front of her for over a couple of years and maybe never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Yes. How many sexually oriented businesses do we have in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Frankly, not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Most of them are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| And so there have been no, there haven't had to be any hearings, you've said, for several years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| That's the information that's been presented to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Okay. So how is compensation determined for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| And maybe this isn't a question for you, but for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| It's in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| It's in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| There's a set rate per hour and then there's a cap per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Nothing if no one calls in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| If he's not called, there's no remuneration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| So basically you just get our thanks until you're actually called upon to do some work and then you get paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Any other questions? Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Thank you, sir. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Oh, we need a vote on number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| We have a motion to send it on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| We need a formal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| And it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| On page three, item number ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| approval of a contract in the amount of $87,780 with Reliance Communications, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| for a public notification system for North County schools, resolution 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| As all things educational consent go, whether it be today, I think, and let me say up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| I asked Russ Oaks if he had anything to say about these six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| He said he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| So I'm going to say something about one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| These items are about electronics, food, adult education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:26| and then the one that we have here in front of us, public notification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| There are a lot of things that I've noticed at school board meetings that basically we have no control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| I would like to comment on this one in particular, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| This contract is cheaper than the contract that it's replacing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Somebody, okay, I get an up and down head shake in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| I just wanted to make that comment that they may think I attend school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| and not know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Well, maybe I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| But on this particular set of things, some of them are beyond their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| They just have to take whatever's bid today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| But on this little, maybe it's a small monetary item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| but it's a huge concern to parents because this is the way the public gets information out of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| And I commend them for getting maybe a new system or a different system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| and saving the school system money to boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Is this the parent notification system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Is that included in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| Sorry, Dr. McIntyre, I didn't mean to make you come all the way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Mr. Chairman, my name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Yes, this is a contract to replace what's currently known as ParentLink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| which is an automated calling system that allows us to notify parents either at the school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| or district-wide in the case of just information items that we want to provide to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| or to be able to communicate with parents in a crisis situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| So it allows us to send automated calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| It allows us to send text messages, e-mail messages to a large number of recipients in a very short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| As the commissioner noted, this is actually a fairly substantial savings from our current contract with the current bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| and we actually think it provides a more robust capability for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| So it's a good deal all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Well, let me tell you that the parent notification system has been invaluable for our family this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| with getting information both about things going on at school and information about our individual child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| So it's been a godsend for us, and we do appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| and think it's an important thing that the school does for us, for parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Dr. McIntyre, just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| The automated system, is it dovetailed to schools specifically, like one school can use it for their system of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| and another school can send out different messages, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| And what's the savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| You were talking about the savings compared to the previous system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| It is in the tens of thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| I think our current contract is, Mr. Oakes can correct me if I get this wrong, about $130,000, $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| So it's about, you know, $60,000 savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Item number 11, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| determining the method of disposal of the Solway Green Waste property, which includes 50.86 acres located at 8706 Joe Daniels Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| and 106.49 acres located at 8707 Joe Daniels Road for a total of 157.35 acres to be by request for proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3651)|
| 1:01:01| to negotiate a sale or public auction, which is recommended by purchasing resolution 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Mr. Van de Veet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Mr. Van de Veet, can you, what is the recommendation for the disposal of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Do you have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I'll let Mr. Holt, the purchasing director, speak to that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Oh, well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Do we have an appraisal on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Do we know what the property might be worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| It has been ordered and we will have it next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Hugh, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| I think that because of the nature of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| and some of our desire not to dictate what lands there in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| this piece of property probably lends itself better to a public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| What percentage of this 157 acres is going to be reusable by anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:10| I'd be reluctant, Commissioner Brown, without pulling the survey out to give you acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Obviously the portion at the top of the hill where the concrete pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| and the current operation exists, that's the most viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| for lack of a better term, portion of the property that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| whether it was for industrial, residential, or commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| A lot of the property is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Some folks have over the years had the impression that it is waterfront property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| and it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| There is actually a railroad track at the bottom of the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| that separates the property from the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I'll be glad to get you a figure, if you like, on the top of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and that portion at the bottom that's close to Oak Ridge Highway that is suitable for some form of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:59| if that helps any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Well, the reason I'm asking is because back a couple or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| whenever we had a lot of discussions, yea and nay, I was on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| And there's stuff buried out there that scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| I saw a lot of it sticking up out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| At that point, it was not totally covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| I wouldn't consider it a building lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I'm not even sure I'd want to graze my cattle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| That's why I'm wondering how much of this is going to be usable for any type of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| or is it going to be, what is it fit for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| That's, you know, that's kind of a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Yes, sir, and I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| I do think the appraisal will speak to potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| and certainly it's going to speak to the market value of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| I don't want to answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| This is a terrific piece of property and will make a great addition to the tax rolls of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| I need a good spin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| You moving over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| And I'd also like to say that I agree that all we have to have is two qualified bidders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| who are interested in a prime piece of more than 100 acres of property to determine its fair value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| and I would be in support of it being auctioned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| The people there now, the natural resources over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| do they still have a lot of that stuff that still needs to be churned up and chipped up before they get gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Just a little bit of background, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| I couldn't give you an estimate on the cubic yardage of material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| but they've been noticed for several months now that their contract is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| We've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Knox County does not intend to renew it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| and the contract provides very specific terms and conditions for how we're to inherit the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| because one thing we did not want to do is inherit the site with a lot of leftover equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| or a lot of leftover material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Tom Salter and Ben White, who is our capital projects manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| have been on site a number of times and have been in touch with NRRT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| and NRRT does understand our expectation as to how Knox County is to inherit the site at the end of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| And this is going away, what, July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| No, sir, July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| And then we've got plan B to go to, to do our solid waste after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| We actually do not have to operate a facility of this kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| We're one of the very few municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| or governments that does not have curbside brush and leaf pickup that does operate a facility like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| We're comfortable that we'll continue to meet our TDEC diversionary requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| One thing we do want to do going forward is look at the model that's in your district, the Halls model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| That works very well for the average homeowner who prunes some leaves off a Bradford pear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| or cuts down a holly bush and has a small load that he or she needs to take somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| We think that incorporating that into some of the other convenience center operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| is a much better model than a great big commercial operation like we have at Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| Speaking of that, what you've got there in the Halls area, they come and they drop that stuff off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| Now, who pays for the Hall bill to take that dumpster off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| Does Goodwill pay that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Goodwill reimburses us, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| In fact, we got a check from them last week for $1,655.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Goodwill collects a modest fee from incoming people who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| And then we charge them our hauling costs and we charge them our tipping fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| So it's revenue neutral to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| How's the land zone currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| So could a prospective bidder set up another mulch site there in the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:07| Certainly they'd have to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| You know, from the zoning question, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| but the permit that it operates on is held by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| and it's our intent to retire the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| So they would have to seek their own permit from the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| And as far as the actual zoning, I'll check on that and I'll know more on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| But I'll let you know during the course of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| You know, I was a fan of the concept of the county dealing with green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| The, you know, theoretical concept of that was a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| We kind of tripped up over ourselves time and time again, and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| So I'm going to support getting rid of the facility in terms of what the county's role in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4069)|
| 1:08:00| But I think there's a greater, you know, message out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And I said this initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Ladies and gentlemen, indoor plumbing comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Generating electricity comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| These nice conveniences when we, you know, flush that commode or send the water down a kitchen sink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| we have to deal with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And, again, the Solway facility was a unique and marginally successful way of dealing with the volume of waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:36| that we generate as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| So, you know, and I'd like Dwight to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| I've read something here on how you think you're going to stay in compliance with the state numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| Could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| The 1991 Municipal Solid Waste Act requires 25% of our inbound volume to be diverted from Class I landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| The measurement, though, Commissioner, is taken per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| So when it's calculated, the Solid Waste Advisory Board considers all the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| They consider the volume that the city takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| They consider the volume that private sector firms who do the same thing that NRRT is doing at Solway take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| And they consider the volume that we take at our convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| And, remember, we have a very robust recycling program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| It's just not centered on organic green waste at all the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Mixed metals, mixed papers, aluminum, glass, plastic, newsprint, and cardboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| All those volumes are considered and then it's calculated on a per capita basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| So we're still very comfortable that we'll meet our diversionary requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| We don't necessarily disagree with you at all about the merits of recycling green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| And two things that we want to prevent are homeowners either dumping it in ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| which creates storm water issues, or burning it, which creates air quality issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| And so from our standpoint, if we can take the halls model and expand it to as many centers as we can across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| where the people who are already coming in one or two days a week bringing their garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| can just add that organic green waste in the spring and in the fall when they prune bushes, trees, leaves, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| add that to their mix, then we think it's going to be more successful for us over the long haul than the Solway facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| which really just serves commercial landscapers and commercial tree cutters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| So I think what I've heard within that is that if Congress, and we know Congress or State, House, and Senate is prone to do some strange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:47| things, if they separate it out somehow, identify Knoxville as a unique entity since they deal with their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| but they have a plan of dealing with recycling and waste and whatnot, and the county does, if that is somehow separated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| we would not meet the 1991 mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| Oh, I know it's probably an unfair question to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Maybe you can get that back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| But it would be tight, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I think we could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Well, if we're in hypotheticals, it's hard for me to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| And, Commissioner, in all fairness, it feels a little bit like a hypothetical question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Well, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I mean, the city picks up its own trash and deals with its own trash, you know, curbside pickup and all that good stuff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| I mean, that's not a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| So roughly 200,000 of our 400,000 folks have a separate waste stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| And they have recycling at several locations, a few locations within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| That are heavily utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| So, I mean, again, different things come in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| I mean, at this point, I'm just being real, right now the EPA has been watered down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| You know, eight years ago it was pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| And things go like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| And, you know, as things evolve, I mean, there's no telling, you know, what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| What I'm saying, and this isn't really directed at you, is I like what you're saying as far as taking it to the actual sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:26| But I think we need to not throw away Solway and throw away the idea as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| So, you know, maybe it's a charge to us is what I'm delivering is things can evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:42| We can find ourselves on the wrong side of a law and then we're forced to do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| So I guess what I'm saying is Solway did take a significant portion, you know, into their stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| So make sure that we have a plan available, that we're thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| that maybe one day this may, you know, come back and we'll need to be positioned to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| When we talk about them vacating the Solway site, what do we have over them that if we show up on the 31st of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| or the 1st of August, what do we have to hold them accountable that their site is exactly the way we want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| Do we have a withholding of payment or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| You know, Commissioner, I've not looked at the contract in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| I do not think there is a withholding of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Now, we've created just in anticipation, just to keep everybody within their lane, as Commissioner McKenzie says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| we've noticed them early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| We've actually done an inventory on site and submitted photographs of things that we think would need to be remediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| And as far as a withholding of payment, I guess that would be a question I'd have to defer to the law department on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| to see if we have the authority to do it under the terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| I will say that NRRT has been very gracious from the start as far as dealing with us in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| We've gotten no resistance from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| And I would like to think that they will continue to cooperate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| And I think that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| They have signaled to us that they are looking for another site somewhere within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| and that they might very well like to stay in this market and in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| And assuming that that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| I certainly think it would encourage them to work with us well on exiting this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Thanks, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| It's been a while since we've seen Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| And I was just wondering about the status, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| do we know anything about what's going on there and the role of the county in that suit and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4493)|
| 1:15:02| Let me speak to what I do know, Commissioner, what I feel more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| I did go ahead and send a copy of the caption of this resolution to Andy Corbett at TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| just to make him aware that we were coming to commission for permission to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| and asking him if he had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| He did answer me and said, thank you for sending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And, no, I have no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| We've been working extensively with Mr. Walls on wrapping up the audit of solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| And so he's been a party to this discussion as far as the fact that we are coming to commission to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:38| And I also have noticed that Mr. Sturkey in the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| that we were coming to commission to sell the property and he hasn't expressed any concern either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| So the folks that I was aware of whom I thought I was duty bound to notify that might have an interest in the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| and a standing to express some concern have all been notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| and none of them have come back to us and suggested any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| You broached the subject of environmental issues as it's disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| And so the site itself in terms of environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| you think that that's going to be, that's not going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| There were some water retention pond failures, et cetera, et cetera, that affected people's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| Do you see some other issues around environmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| As of January 2011, TDEC has given us a clean bill of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| and we have no outstanding violations at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| And then the other thing, I saw Tom Salter out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| I was just wondering if Tom would come up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Tom's one of those guys that he and I think we might have a little brotherhood going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| or something for getting beat up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| So I just wanted Tom, just give Tom an opportunity to say, comment or talk about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4612)|
| 1:17:01| talk about whatever you think that's important maybe that hadn't been said relative to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| My name is Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| I'm a Solid Waste Director for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| I live at 1000 Sky Blue Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| When Dwight came on board, we had several discussions about the future of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| And one of the things that kind of Dwight initiated a discussion internally about what are the public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:30| implications of operating a site that was primarily for like the wood, the land clearing and landscaping industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:40| and a minor, a small amount would be for individual homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| And so that was one discussion that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| And we were coming down on the side of perhaps we don't need to be in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| This comes from the new mayor too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| If the private sector can step up and do it, maybe it's something we don't need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| And there are different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| I think Dwight mentioned if a municipality is collecting wood in every neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| they nearly have to have their own wood grinding capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Well, we don't do that as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| The city obviously does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| We don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| The other thing on the recycling goals, I think for many years and even when I came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:32| the previous director and to some extent when I first came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| I was influenced by a move on the part of TDEC to do a rule change that would do, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| what somebody suggested and that is the county would be responsible for recycling 25 percent of everything it touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:54| not just like TDEC would look at each municipality and say, you have to recycle 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| And honestly, when Commissioner McKenzie asked, right now we're only about 12 percent of what we touch if we don't count green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:09| Now, if that rule change, we are going to implement some additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| and we're going to anticipate trying to move more of that weight from garbage boxes to recycling boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| And we're going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| And all I can tell you is there are, you know, if we move about 15 percent of our weight out of garbage to recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:32| we'll make 25 percent recycling rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| So I don't know what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| The city has this program now, single stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| Single stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| So is there any discussion of single stream in reference to county solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:54| For some of the centers, the very small centers like the current Carn Center, the current Carter Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| we are looking into putting what would be considered single stream boxes there simply because they're so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| We don't have room for a box for each material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| But in terms of right now, you always get a better price if you can separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| So for the foreseeable future, as long as we've got a system where the public is used to separating at the centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| we're going to keep doing that because we get far more in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| If it's pure cardboard or pure mixed paper, we're going to get a lot more money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Hey, thanks, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Hugh, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| More question for you and Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| You know, Tony mentioned Brad Mays and bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| We've not heard from him in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| He was telling us that natural resources owes us quite a bit of money, quite a bit, close to a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| I mean, I hope that you guys are keeping an eye on this because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| I'm not in this lawsuit, but we hear all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| And the courts are going to settle it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| But I just want you to be aware of that or have an open end on our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| any money that is owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| If it comes to truition, what he's saying, that we're going to be able to get our money out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| My Deputy Director, Matt Myers, as well as Mr. Salter and Mr. Vandervate are watching those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Commissioner Zanders and Brown, you made the motion and Commissioner Brown seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| Do you agree for the public auction aspect of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| So all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Item number 12, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| approving an agreement of sale with the Tennessee Department of Transportation in the amount of $8,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| for a countywide owned parcel identified as parcel number 094HD022 for the purposes of widening SR62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:57| also known as Oak Ridge Highway, in a project which will be completed by Tennessee Department of Transportation Resolution 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Question, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Can you tell us exactly, I know that this is $8,000, but what is being done to Oak Ridge Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| It says the widening of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Yes, sir, widening and lane improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Is this all of Oak Ridge, a portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| It's a TDOT project, so I'm not as familiar with it as I might be if it's a county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| But it's the one that's been under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| It's had some press recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| This particular piece of property is actually one that we were fairly glad to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| We believe that it came into Knox County's possession as a consequence of a tax sale and has just been sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| So when TDOT came along to buy it, we were glad to part with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| No, it's in the Chaud Road to Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| It's not in the current one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Yes, sir, I think it's the Chaud Road to Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Any opposition? Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| On page four, item 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| approving a contract in the amount of $182,600, 100% federally funded with CMAQ program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:18| for a signal system communications master plan and signal timing optimization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| This is resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| I just wanted to ask somebody a question or two about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| Dwight, this is engineering again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:45| You're wondering if I drew a short straw today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| This particular contract, and Cindy Pionkey is really the expert on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| but they're going to retime 14 signal lights, four on Cedar Bluff, nine on Highway 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| one at Norris Freeway in Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| And they're going to do before and after studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| And this is a new product for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| They're going to do before and after studies that they will publish in layman's terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| as to how traffic's been improved and the changes that result from the retiming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| And they're also going to develop a master plan for the 60-some-odd signals that we presently operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| long-term planning in terms of how those signals communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| and connect to each other and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| There's some technical aspects that Cindy's probably a little better versed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| if anybody's got questions about traffic signal connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| These are not red light cameras, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| No, sir, they are not red light cameras whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Commissioner Norman, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| It just has no impact on our budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| No fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| It's fully reimbursed, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| Is Cindy out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Yes, Cindy's out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| Cindy, sometimes I hate these automated things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Is this a good one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Is this a good system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Essentially what the master plan's going to do is lay out for the next 25 to 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| what we need to be doing technologically with our signal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| It's going to break it down into the first eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| and essentially like the next eight years after that and beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| And essentially the idea is that as you drive between different jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| in our case the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| as you're driving along, you don't care that you've changed jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| You don't even want to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| And so the idea is that it will be a seamless transportation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| in terms of your signal timing as you approach the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| So as part of the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| they're going to look at the different types of hardware we need to be purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| and it needs to meet what they call the national architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| And this is just kind of standard stuff that we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| What type of sensors are used for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| I mean, are there different systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| There are in-pavement sensors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| There's radar sensors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| The majority of ours right now are in the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| That may be one of the outcomes of this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| that we switch to the overhead like the city of Knoxville has at several locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| in terms of being able to pick up on somebody being in the turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| We'll just kind of have to wait and see what comes out of the actual contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| and the work that they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| But they're going to actually do a survey of all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| as part of the initial part of the study to see what we do have on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| and what works well and then make suggestions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| And a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Most of us have it in our district, you know, main arteries and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| I'm looking at mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| I go down Broadway and it turns into Maryville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| and all that's a state route, and then we've got Emory Road out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| So a lot of our main arteries that we as commissioners have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| they're also state roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Is this don't even look at it as a state road or it's just all the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| The state does not maintain traffic signals in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| and that falls under our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| And two of the corridors that are actually being studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| as part of this contract that we have, one is Cedar Bluff Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| which is strictly a Knox County road, and then the other is Bannerville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| and it will go from Rifle Range all the way up to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| All of those signals are included in addition to the one in Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| and Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| And those are all part of that's on a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| All of those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| So if a traffic light goes out, that's the county's responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5276)|

| 1:28:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| I had pulled this in case there were any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| If not, we'll move right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5302)|

| 1:28:45| development of a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Mr. Troyer, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Would you kind of update us on where we are with the Carter school plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| The Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| we have received on behalf of the Industrial Development Board six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| The evaluation committee has met once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| and they're going to meet again this week two times to further evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| And we hope to be able to be in a position to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| after these two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| What we have before us, and then the timing of that would be first the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| Industrial Development Board, then the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| and then the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| What you have before you is a proposal for a memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| So as we move forward in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| this is how we're going to work together, and this has nothing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| this just has no expenses on Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| how we would share expenses or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| but this is how we would share the administrative expenses as we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| I just got word that we have spent a total of $4,600 so far in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| It's my anticipation that we're not going to keep the expenses as low as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| and so there's not going to be a huge amount of administrative expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| But we have committed to the Industrial Development Board that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| cover the expenses of this process so they would be made whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| And we're not asking the county commission for any more approval for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| We can handle it with what budget is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Just listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Well, you know, I read this and didn't really understand why it's before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| And now with that latest explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| I definitely don't understand why this is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| Basically what you're saying is you have the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| you feel you have the budget to take care of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| but this is to clarify the fact that we're going to take care of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| And it's putting the three bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| If this goes forward and if there's a proposal that the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| committee recommends and for the commission to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| this is how we're going to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| So I think this is a real easy MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And so we would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| I just think it's a bit premature in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| because we don't know what we don't know what you all are looking at in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| terms of those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| There may be some, you know, the whole thing was get creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| The market's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Get creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| I haven't a clue what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| I guess if we have this memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| and I guess I'm talking to the fellow commissioners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| regardless what side you are on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| if this commits us to something going post-evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:53| I just think we're a little early for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| I don't see what would be the harm in waiting until we have a ROC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| to understand how that ROC would move forward or not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| whichever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| And we do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| I think you could make the argument that this piece of it is late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| that this is how we're going to work together to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| And then once the outcome of the process goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| then we'll have something to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| But this is just how we're going to work together as we go through a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| process to come up with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| And so there's no construction element to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| This is just how we're going to work together until we get to a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| And then when we get a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| that's when we can talk about what project, if any, will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| and how that might be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| I mean, but there will be an understanding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| that's what these are for, to say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| this is a skeleton that we'll use to move forward with whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| I just think we're, and I don't disagree that this may be late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| but this whole process has just been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| I know it's been pretty tumultuous for you and Hugh as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| but at this point it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| You know, it's something that came out of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| a fairly late process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| It came out after the capital plan was out, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| this was an alternative, and we pursued that avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| So you're right, we're late, but I think this might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| might compound that lateness in a negative way for all the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| So I guess I'm going to turn my light off right now and see what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| I would like to just speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| and we have asked the Industrial Development Board to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| they've never done before, and so we have had a verbal understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| and we just thought it was prudent to reduce this to writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| and we think the scope of this memorandum of understanding is narrow enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| that it's not going to be, not much there, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| But this is just how we're going to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| I understand that, I do, but this whole thing scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:29| We could be having all kinds of celebrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| giving high fives about how great of a process this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| or we could be kicking ourselves, and it will be one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| I think that's where this new thing is going to lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| It's going to be great and a model for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| or it's going to be a huge operational drain on Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| and we'll be asking ourselves, what were we thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| It's going to be one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| I don't think this is going to be something that, oh, well, we used it once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| we'll put it on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Either it will be used or it won't ever, ever be used again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| So, again, I'm trying to, you know, tread lightly here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| and I think the less done the better until we can get a feel for what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| Not knowing what those proposals say, this body, we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| we don't have a clue as to what those things say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| and who's going to end up with what role based on the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| There may be some things in there that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Industrial Development Board is not happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| You know, again, it just concerns me that we're going to go into an MOU without much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:52| Well, this is really just to collect information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| and we're asking the IDB to go through this process and without any resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| just a verbal commitment that the county will pay for the administrative expenses of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| And I think eventually what one outcome might be is that if there is a proposal that's accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| and recommended from the Evaluation Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| that that recommendation would include a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| and possibly a financing agreement, those two different agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| and those agreements would include, you know, the price of the building, the delivery date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| financing arrangements, and all the details that would go with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| and that would have to go to the IDB and the school board and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and it would have to have affirmative votes in all three bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| And what we'd like to do is just make a commitment to the IDB that we're going to at least pay our share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:54| We're asking them to do this, and so we're going to pay for expenses as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| to be able to just make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| And the recommendation may be that we do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| We have to wait for the Evaluation Committee to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| I'd have to, I think, disagree with Mr. McKenzie in this respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| Right now they're the equivalent of driving without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| We have nothing that says, you know, we can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| I think we need to have this so that we have a formal agreement that they are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| and as Mr. Troyer just pointed out, it may be that in the end we don't do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| but still they're operating on a legal basis to do what we've asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| and I think we need to give them a permission slip, so to speak, or a license to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| There's a motion on the floor and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5868)|

| 1:38:21| Any questions the Commissioners have for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Well, I guess, how did this, was this open bid or was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:32| These services were competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5912)|

| 1:38:45| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| identifying the rules promulgated by the Knox County Audit Committee relative to a process by which employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| taxpayers, or other citizens may confidentially report suspected illegal, improper, wasteful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| or fraudulent activity, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Motion has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Unless you want to defer it again, we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| I'd like to wait until we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| We're going to meet the day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| We meet the day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| We meet in eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I don't think there's any harm in deferring it one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| I know that I've had some conversations with Mr. Jarrett about some different ways that we can approach this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| and it's going to be on the agenda at the Audit Committee on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| Do we need a substitute motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| No, he's changed his motion to move to defer to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| And the second is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| So all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Defer to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Motion of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| The Commission of Knox County, Tennessee requests that the Knox County Law Director conduct research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| to determine whether Section 2-286 of the Knox County Code may be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| to provide for the reimbursement of Knox County employees and elected and appointed officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| for court costs and attorney's fees in matters other than ouster lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| or matters not otherwise provided in Section 2-286 of the Knox County Code, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| Let me just say that the reason I have put this on is we have received a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| from some of the individuals that were involved a couple of years ago, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| They're now being asked to pay $175 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| These are former commissioners who served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| It's not a lot of money, but they just don't feel that they should have to pay that, and I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| Also, we have a situation where Commissioner Smith was asked to go before the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| He felt bound to hire legal counsel to defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| He was found innocent of any wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| So this basically is just asking the Law Director to look into our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| and bring back before you any revisions that might need to be made to take care of those matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| So is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Mr. Chairman, I'll recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Commissioner Smith is recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Any opposition? Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| On page seven, item number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6069)|

| 1:41:23| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| I just need a description of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| Is this Watt Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:50| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| I'm Steve Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| I live on Everett Road there in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| I'm Steve Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| I live on Everett Road there in West Knox County, about a mile behind this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Mr. Maddox, my name is Tony Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| and I'm the co-chair of the Hillside Task Force on steep slope ridgetop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:18| Obviously this would be a site that would be a very difficult one for somebody like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| that's been involved in this work for such a long time to have any understanding of at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| And so I guess that's what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| There's a saying, if you want to be understood, seek to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| So I'm going to try to understand this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| So if you would, would you help me understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| I guess by starting with how it was, you know, just give us the history on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| and catch us up to where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Well, the history of this site goes back that I'm aware of, or fully aware of, for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| It started off five years and probably earlier ago than that where it was what's called a borrow pit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| where several of the large road contractors just dug straight into the side of the hill out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| pushed the trees up in a pile, and there's one little blue line stream on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| They dammed it up with the trees and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| It was a mess, and TDEC was having serious problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| When we bought the property, assembled three tracks out there, it took approximately three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| and came up with a development plan to clean up the property because of its location there at the I-40 and 75 split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:45| and because it's an entrance into the southwest end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| The other thing that a lot of those hills or the other three quadrants of the interstate down there are limestone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| and when you look across the interstate behind Petros where they cut that hill off, it's solid rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| There's nothing else much could be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| This quadrant is shale dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| The entire hillside there is shale dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| And we've had it bored and tested and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| and the soils stand up good to a terracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| And so it's all been engineered and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| and we've done everything out there according to the permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| and TDEC is very pleased with the work that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| We've opened that stream back up, and we've really cleared it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| Now, I'm not really involved and haven't kept really in touch with what's going on with the hillside development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:49| because I've been so involved in this one, but this one was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| It started, was approved, and it's been ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| and everything we've been doing out there according to the plans and codes and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| has all been done before the hillside initiative was, I think, ever even thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| or before it got as heated as it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| And so, you know, I'm not sure how I feel about the hillside initiative moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| but as far as this property goes, it was all, this whole property and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| and everything about it was approved before the hillside initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| You mentioned that five years ago there was a bar pit activities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| Who owned the site and who was involved in the bar pit creation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| Well, there were three separate property owners of this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| and two of which have passed away now, and one was on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:58| which really wasn't involved in the bar pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| But it was just some of your largest grading contractors here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| that did highway projects and county road projects and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| and anywhere they needed fill dirt to build roads and different things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| because this is good dirt for that use, they came in and just cut straight in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| basically made a cliff just digging straight into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| We actually filled that part to use the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Okay. You mentioned the Blue Line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Does this stream have a name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| No. The particular one on the property doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| It's very small, and it doesn't actually run 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| It just runs when there's water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| So it's between the site we see as we see it from I-40 and I-40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| Is that where the Blue Line stream is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Okay. Where is the stream? It's on the backside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| It actually comes down the front beside the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| And if you look out there, this is the road that I've started into the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| and if you look at that road, you'll see where we've put river stones up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| This was in an agreement and a plan that we made in conjunction with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| about restoring that stream, and that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Okay. And I'm trying to – I don't have a recollection of five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| and what that site looked like, but it seemed like you went to the top of the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| and correct me now, as far as your process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| it seems like the site was partially forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| and you took it on over the top of the ridge, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Well, it had some areas of it were – I guess the best way to say it was hodgepodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| In other words, they had truck roads and different areas going across the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| and out the backside and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| It was not like solid forest or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| It was just – it was a heavy grading site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| And permitting process and that type of thing, you're in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| there's no regulation that you violate, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| I guess ideally – and I'll stop with these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| Ideally, you have now sort of these large signs out there that say site available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| and you've got benches cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| How many benches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Three benches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And so the last bench that's closest to the top of the ridge is how close to the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, I don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Average about 60 to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| I mean, it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| And ideally, you would have somebody that could come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| and locate a business on each one of those benches, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| And you'll have roads that will access each of those three benches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Now, the backside of the property, you're also wanting to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| I haven't been on the backside, I haven't seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| but that's part of this TIF process for you to have access to the backside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| Well, the backside is accessed now from Everett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| and the grading plan calls for the 60 or 70 feet on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| Because that's taken off, that's moved to the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| and it's stair steps down the back in three tiers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| And then it goes out the backside onto the existing Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| I just had a couple of questions for Buzz Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| I know he's out here, and then I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| I'll see what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Okay, Buzz, thanks for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Would you give us any – could you add anything to what you just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| in terms of MPC's involvement in this process since Mr. Maddox has taken over the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| I got in kind of maybe midway through his presentation, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| Buzz Johnson with MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| We – as far as I know, and I try to do a quick review back in our archives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| our computer archives, we're showing nothing on our computer map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| indicating when the property was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| So it's probably been rezoned to CB for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| Having said that, we reviewed a series – well, we reviewed a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| a couple of final plans back in 2007, March to April, May of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| Concept plan was approved according to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| We noted in that plan that the site had already been disturbed to a considerable degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:16| Anecdotally and maybe true of a lot of you that passed by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| that site has been pretty rough for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| But he came in and presented a plan to divide that into –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| I think he was looking at potentially, when all is said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| approximately 18 lots for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| And you can see the result to date of what you have out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| But at that time in 2007, looking at the staff report, there were several conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:51| I don't see anything that is noted that stands out that appeared to be an issue at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6711)|
| 1:52:01| So that's a very rough assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| I'll try to answer questions as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Thanks, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Mr. Maddox, just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| In terms of the continued development of the property, have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| and I assume you're – are you from East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I was born and raised right here in Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| So you have an appreciation of these ridges just like we all do that are born here, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| Have you considered anything in terms of remediation on the site in a further –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| in a more advanced way in terms of reforestation, office surface mining techniques, you know, to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| because it does look like a – you know, it looks like not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| It looks bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Well, it's in a – obviously it's in a stage of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| And we were moving along at a quicker pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| And then this recession hit three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| And so what we have done, we made a business decision to what I would call slow walk the development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| through this recession period so that we just hadn't gone out there and spent all the money and maybe it be sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:15| Now, here in about the last six to nine months, we've marketed and worked the property for the full three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:23| but in the last six to nine months, we have a lot of interest now that's coming back around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| and companies that are interested in locating out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| And so if you look at some of the renderings there on the package that I gave you, the first three or four pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:42| that's a pretty good indication of how that property will be landscaped and taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:50| And I'm glad to say and thankful to say that I have a pretty good history of development here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| and my developments turn out to look like the renderings do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| A lot of people look at something before it's done and say, I just can't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| But when it's finished, it really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| And so I'm pleased to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| I'd like to point out one other thing, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| This TIF that we're discussing, not one penny goes into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| One hundred percent of the TIF is for the public infrastructure that will service the entire West Knox County down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:34| This Watt Road exit and Everett Road is the southwest entrance into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| And it's also an entrance into Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| although we don't want to talk about that one too much because you get the tax dollars over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| This is purely in Knox County and not in Loudoun County and not in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| But it serves West Knox County and the entrance into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| And the way this road would look, if you can kind of picture it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| from the Hardin Valley exit from Pellissippi Parkway down to Hardin Valley School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| that's the type of road that we're looking at funding here for this entrance into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| And it is badly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| And, again, I say not one cent goes into the property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| It's all for public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| It's the roads, a mile and a half of roads, two and a half miles of water lines that are badly needed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:39| There's not enough fire flow, fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| And one and a half miles of sewer line, there's not enough sewer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| As a matter of fact, we've got a representative here from West Knox Utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| They're agreeing to pay half the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| We would be paying the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| They think it's a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| The county, the impact to the county is tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| There's a study that we had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| It was done by Ken Woodford, a very highly respected appraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| and does different types of impact studies here in Knoxville, very highly respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| A copy of the main two pages of that study are included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| And it shows that this project is going to generate close to $11 million in tax revenue a year when it's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:33| I think, and Ken Woodford has a history and a reputation of being conservative, and I think that's conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| The other thing that it shows, which is really important, and as we all know that live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| Knoxville needs 1,600 more jobs, full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Those are not to mention the jobs that include building the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| and building all the other infrastructure and everything that will be about a year or two year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| and the construction jobs, building the developments and the buildings and businesses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:11| Well, Mr. Maddox, I'll let some other people ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| They'll get more into the details of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| If this had not been a disturbed site, would you have purchased it for its use that you have designed right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:34| Well, I think, I just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| I'm asking you if you would have taken that ridge down and scalped it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| Scalped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Would you have done that for a commercial endeavor like you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| Maybe not, but it was scalped previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| And I have, I've got to say here again, I've got a good history of quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| I have some concerns about doing a TIF on this development or any development where, well, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:17| you've already got lots of interest, lots of interested businesses that want to locate there, that are interested in locating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:27| So, I mean, and that area is going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| This isn't, although it's, I think, a good example of what we don't want to see with the way that our ridges have been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:44| I still don't consider it blighted in the sense that we usually think of when we talk of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:53| So, and I do understand that you're saying it's all for the public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| but it's all public infrastructure that you need for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| You're not just putting something in because the county needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| It's something that's going to benefit you and your development first and foremost, and if it benefits the county in addition, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:18| So, I know that Sam has some questions, too, but I just, I would like to make a substitute motion that we send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:32| I think that there are still a lot of questions that need to be asked and answered before Monday about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:41| This is not something that I generally think is appropriate for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| I'll second it because I'm sure we'll have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| Well, if there's any kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| If there's any kind of dissent, there's not going to be, it's not going to be a dissent anyway, so it will be discussed Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| I don't disagree with what Amy says on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| We can have a week to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| It's not going to be decided today, so I don't think that's a break or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| I think it's fine to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| And I've spoken in the past about some of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| and I'm sure that Commissioner McKenzie has and what Amy Broyles has about TIFs for areas that are non-blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:34| But I think that we can't be too rigid in the way we think about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| And I'm speaking for this TIF and for this project is that we're in a different time now than what we were a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| Probably five years ago I would not have supported this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| But now we need jobs, we need tax revenues, we need a way to progress with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| This is not only allowing this project to go forward, it's not only allowing for better fire service to the people that live out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:07| better sewers, better roads, but it's also correcting a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| And anybody that's been driving out there in the last five or six years sees that this, you know, that area out there is not very pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| I also just want to add that I don't think you can always judge what a project is going to look like when it's completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| by looking at it right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| I think if you came and looked at some plastic surgery when you're in the middle of a facelift or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| probably no one would ever have a facelift done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| So the results can, or any type of surgery, or making sausage, whatever you want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| so you really can't judge it right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| But even more so, we're in a different era right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| There's no more of this free money that's given away so projects can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| We're in a period right now of high unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| For some people, maybe jobs don't matter, but in most communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| we would say that the schools are definitely important to educate our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| but the reason we're educating our kids is so they can get better jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| And if you're a family where the breadwinner is involved in construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| projects like this are absolutely of paramount importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| I mean, to have a job and to be able to support your family is extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| and we're having to look at new and creative ways to allow projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| and important public projects to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| We just got through talking about the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| and I know about new ways of looking at financing our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| and we've had to be very creative to come up with a way where we can get a new school at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| without having to go further in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| We also, just when this session started, we had people talk about the way we do our debt and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| Yeah, we could borrow money at some point to improve the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| and we could borrow money to put in better sewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| or we could let the utilities do it and let them raise rates on people out there to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| But I think this is a win-win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| We create, we correct, and I soar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| We get better coverage for the people that live out there for their fires and sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| I really like the idea of eventually having an additional $11 million of tax revenue coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| I know we'll be delaying for a number of years the property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| because it's going to be the property tax increase that pays for the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| but just as soon as they start selling things out there, we're going to have those sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| And every time we talk about laying off teachers or not being able to have the finances to fix a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:47| we ought to think about this $11 million, and we need to think about other projects that we've declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| So I would like to speak very much in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| And even to talk about just some of the TIFs for non-blighted areas in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:04| we're really looking at new ways to finance things when the old system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| and the old way of financing it isn't working anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| and it's a way to help put some of our people here in the county without a job back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| And so I'm speaking in favor of this, and I hope that next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| I certainly support the idea of looking at it further, but I hope next Monday we do vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| So you guys don't think I'm going to be in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Is that what you were saying earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| That was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| So is there anyone here from IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| I thought I saw you earlier, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| Stuart had some conversations on the last TIF a couple of months ago that we ended up passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:11| and you indicated that this was, you know, this type of TIF was not the way that IDB was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| the economic development flavor of TIF as opposed to the blight flavor of TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| was not the way that the IDB was looking to go forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| And here we are two months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| We have another hyper-capital income area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| heavily retailed area, built-out area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:50| that because of sprawl, roads didn't keep up, that we're asking for a TIF for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| How can we ask, how can you all ask us for that today is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| Let me just differentiate a little bit about where we were a couple of months ago versus this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| You know, the TIF at North Shore was one that was approved, I think it was three or four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| and there was some changes in ownership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| And we were coming back to confirm that this body still wouldn't move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| This one, actually, we are coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| This hasn't been before the IDB, the way this process is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| and that's why I thought it would be helpful, and it may be helpful for us to hold another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| I think it would be at some point in the near future to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| But what was approved was that the application would be made to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| I would go through it and make sure that all the information that was asked for was actually submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| I would send that on to and meet with county engineering, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| and also with the county mayor's office and provide that information to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| And so I know that Cindy is here and can speak to it from a county roads need perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| But then it really goes to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| And, you know, this is a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| We've debated whether we need this economic development or blight or, you know, does it fit those definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:16| So you all have to make the determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| Is this in the best interest of Knox County to at least move this forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| And if you all as elected officials decide that it is in the best interest, what will happen then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| It will come back to the IDB and we will do a more thorough analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| and it will go before that body as well for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| Because, really, they have to support this as well as this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| But it's really starting with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| It will come to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| If it goes approval through both of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| it would then come back to this body one last time for approval of the economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| So I really can't answer your question how it's different because the board hadn't contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| We think this has the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| This is in the best interest of Knox County for the IDB to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| That's a very fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| And maybe a workshop is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| But what I would like to see out of that is you guys are kind of the engine, you know, with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| I think that's fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| I would kind of like you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| So it sounds like you're saying, hey, it hadn't really come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| I'm putting words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| It hadn't really come before us yet, so don't hold me to a philosophical standard of how we're going to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:41| with TIFFs in Knox County yet because we're not at that point in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:48| So it's going to be difficult to get a flavor of where the IDB is unless you let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:59| And, again, I think I'm putting words in your mouth on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| I do remember you saying that these types of TIFFs, and this was these economic development non-blight type TIFFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:13| is not something that you guys and IDB is going to be going forward with in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| You know, that's not the direction that you guys are wanting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| Pretty sure I remember that, that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| So maybe, Dwight, or maybe I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| Is there a standard that says what the county road priorities are that was preexisting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| Because we can always use new roads, I mean, always, especially in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| But is there something that's longstanding that says this is a priority one, highest need area for county road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:58| The last time that Knox County did a priority in terms of corridors was back in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| And those projects have been on the CIP in the past, but the CIP over time has gotten shortened in its time length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:17| We now do a five-year one as opposed to more like a ten-year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| And so as priorities change, the projects get shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| I cannot say that this was a priority that was identified back at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| I do know that the interchange is one of the ten that needs to be modified within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:41| On the TPO's long-range transportation plan, it is identified, but all ten interchanges are spoken of as being completed by the year 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:51| And that seems rather optimistic to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| And each interchange, give or take, is probably about $30 million to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| Okay. So there's ten throughout the county and 75-40 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| So this is, I mean, that's just one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| Just one of ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| So there's no priority on those ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| They were just identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| They've been identified in the TPO's long-range transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| But, again, so in 2000, this was not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| No, sir, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| Let's talk about something that was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| I think Commissioner Britt says, you know, we're not at the point where we're giving out, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| We're not at the point where we're giving out free money so projects can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| I think that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| That's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| That's exactly what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:58| I know you're going to pay it back, you know, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| that's not been the philosophy of these type of funds being advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:15| You know, I think Mr. Mamatov said he had 14 or so across the state, I think was your number, something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| So this isn't highly used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| It's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| It's frustrating that we keep getting these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| And I'll say it, keep getting these coming from this segment of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| I'll say it, that, golly, we can't say that there is a huge need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:46| And I know we're talking economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| We're talking about more sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| I understand we want to build out to our edges with big box stores, but is this really the way we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7971)|
| 2:13:01| And that's just a, you know, question out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| So question on the fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| Someone's here from West Knox Utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7987)|
