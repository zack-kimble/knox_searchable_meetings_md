| 0:18:51| This is the applicant, is Benjamin Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| from the Oklahoma Federal Bank of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1134)|

| 0:19:04| Track information is 2.51 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| This is the motion, so it will be required a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| Present plan zoning designation is LDR low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| plan commercial, and RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Proposed plan designation zoning is MUNC mixed-use neighborhood center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| and neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| The staff recommendations deny the southwest county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| to the mixed-use neighborhood center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| because it does not meet the criteria for a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| and also deny the CN zoning because it does not meet the zoning amendment criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| and is not consistent with the southwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1191)|

| 0:20:17| All right, Ms. Potts, your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1217)|

| 0:20:25| Okay, my name is Megan Wiley Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1225)|

| 0:20:39| All right, you're free to make your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| My name is Megan Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| My address is 8845 Mallow Drive in the Bexhill subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| where I have lived with my family for almost nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I'm here today as a spokesperson for many of my Bexhill neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| as well as for approximately 1,700 families in our adjacent and nearby neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Bennington, Farrington, Wesley Place, Ebenezer Oaks, Brentmore, Highbury Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| Bluegrass Bend, Willow Bend, Westchester, Farmington, and Foxfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| The Bexhill neighborhood, consisting of 348 single-family residences zoned RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| was developed beginning in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Houses continued to be built into the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| The two entrances from Ebenezer are Bexhill Drive and Gatwick Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| In between the entrances is a 2.51-acre parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| that was never developed by the original developer, Century Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Weigels eventually purchased the land in 1987 but never developed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| In 1998, Weigels sold it to the present owner, Home Federal Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| which never developed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Thus, the property has been extensively used as an open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| recreational area, and gathering place by Bexhill residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| and by residents of nearby neighborhoods for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Before you today is an application to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| from planned commercial to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| and to amend the sector plan from LDR to MUNC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| We fully support the planning staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| to deny both the sector plan amendment and the zoning amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| because the required criteria set out in the Knox County Zoning Ordinance are not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| Regarding the sector plan amendment, the current LDR designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| is clearly the correct designation as the Bexhill subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| except for this one parcel is entirely single-family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| and are immediately adjacent neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| and the neighborhoods in close proximity across Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| In addition, as the planning staff points out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| none of the requirements for amending a sector plan have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| There are no changes of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| warranting amendment of the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| no new roads or additional utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| no obvious or significant error or omission in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| and no trends in development, population, or traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| The 2016 Southwest County Sector Plan, at page 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| under the heading, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1401)|

| 0:23:33| for a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| This would be continuing the existing popular use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| and be a great asset for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Regarding the rezoning application, as stated in the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| the required criteria for rezoning have not been met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| as there are no recent substantial changes to the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| that would warrant a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| The proposed CN zone allows uses that are not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| or compatible with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1440)|

| 0:25:55| and thank you, Ms. Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| We have had two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| at least two meetings on site with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| and we understand their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| and the emotion that's built into this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| because this property has not been developed since 1976| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| when it was first zoned planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and the Home Federal has allowed the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| to be maintained and used for the benefit of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| while it was being marketed for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| We agree with a lot of the actual underpinnings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| of staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| However, we do not agree with the conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| that staff's report reaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| and I want to specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| and we're talking about the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| this zoning took place in 1976 for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| At that time, there was no requirement for sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| When the sector plans were first implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| it should have considered the existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| and that sector plan should have at least accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| and addressed the commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| for this property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| It has not, and since the recent changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| in the sector plan every five to 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| never addressed the existing commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| nor the fact that the property is deed restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| So when you're talking about justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| for a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| you only have to meet one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| If you look on page two of staff's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| sector plan amendment requirements from general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| may meet any one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| but obviously not accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| for the existing commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| on the property since 1976| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| is a obvious or significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So we do believe a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| is warranted under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Regarding the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| planned commercial was available in 1976,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| neighborhood commercial was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| It was not available until 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| There have been significant changes in the area since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| When the property was first zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Ebenezer Drive, which was classified then and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| as a minor arterial highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| had 32 feet of right-of-way and 17 feet of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| They did not have sewer access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| to the property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Now there is sewer access to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| and Ebenezer is according to staff's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| has 65 feet of pavement and 75 feet of right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| During the agenda review on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| planner Portier did note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| and I wrote it down to make sure I got it correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| that as Ebenezer is a minor arterial highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| it could handle the additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Moreover, we've had conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| with Knox County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| regarding access to the property on Bexhill and Gatwick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| and they don't have any concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| with the property being accessed from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| They did note that once we get to a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| that we will have to do a traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and at that time they'd be able to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| what needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| This property has been for sale for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| One of the hindrances for it being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| was that when Wigles sold the property to Home Federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Home Federal's intent was to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| using it as a branch location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| As brick and mortar branch locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| fell out of favor with internet banking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| they began to market the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| However, Wigles had put deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| additional deed restrictions on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| limiting its uses where you couldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| any drive-thru facilities, restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Those deed restrictions are close to expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So we believe the market has changed in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| and that neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| which wasn't available then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| is tailor-made for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Staff notes in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| that the MUNC designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| which was only recently added in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| that this property meets all the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| for that sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| And also when you look at what neighborhood commercial is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| it is intended to provide limited retail services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| and uses in a manner convenient to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and not disruptive to established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| It is intended to go in next to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| so we believe that changing the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| from planned commercial to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| is more compatible with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| with the established residential neighborhood there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and is essentially a down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| because planned commercial does not have any limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| as to the commercial uses available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| where neighborhood commercial does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And many of the uses will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| a subsequent use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| where potential impacts could be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Commissioner Hill said it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| no good deed goes unpunished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| and Home Federal has allowed this property to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and it has created unfortunately an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| that this property should continue to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| as a pocket park but that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| as staff's report says, that's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We'd ask that we allow the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| to be put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| and that because we do meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| the four criteria for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| once the sector plan amendment is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| that you also approve the rezoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| Before we turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| to other members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| this is a difficult choice for all of us, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| We have to understand that properties like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| the owner has a right to use the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and to gain benefit from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| and right now we're in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| where essentially we're denying any use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| And that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| is close to being a taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| which the courts would not look at favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| I think some arrangement has to be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| to allow the property to be used in a reasonable fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| and it's been zoned commercial since 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| There's no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| that it was intended to be used for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| and so we need to move more in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| So personally, as a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I favor amending the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| and toward the mixed use neighborhood center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| and also the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| So I'll open it up and recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1959)|
| 0:32:49| Thanks, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Well, I had planned to say exactly the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| you just finished saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| So I'm going to echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| And I was going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| but I know that there's other people that want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| So I'll withhold the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| until other people get their hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And I was actually going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| some of the same things you did as far as the takings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| The thing that has me most perplexed about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| is that this property has been for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| for over 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| and the neighborhood has never moved to purchase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| to create a park that they claim they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| And I'm not going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| So I'm going to go ahead and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| that we override the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| and approve the MUNC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| as requested for the county's sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| considering that it was not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| this was not taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| due to the error and omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| when all of this was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| from when it was first developed in 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| I have a question to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| and I have several comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I feel that the motion's been made rather hastily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| given the observations I'm about to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| but I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| My first, my question to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| is why are you assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| that the sector plan was in error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| given that as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| in showing it as a low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| given that the purpose of a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| is to look at the overall benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| and impact on the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| and not an individual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| and given the report from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| that use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| was not typically changed at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I failed to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| how it's considered to be an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| and I would submit to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| how, why does he think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| that that is an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| given those two observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| and then I have some additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I think it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| I don't know exactly when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| the sector plans first came into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I don't think any of the current staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| certainly none of the current commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| were around then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| but I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| when the sector plans did come into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| I think that they should have considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| the existing zoning on the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| and that the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| that we do have to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| do not address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| even when they consider options for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| as far as exploring it for a potential pocket park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| they don't address the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| that's inconsistent with the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| that's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I also have some issue with sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| that unlike rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| there's not a notice that goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| to the property owners and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| hey, we're considering a sector plan in your area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| that could affect your rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| to do something with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Had that been the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I'm sure whomever owned the property at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| LIBELs or Home Federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| would have participated in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| to make sure that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| a sector plan that was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| with their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| So I think the failure to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| we have to assume they failed to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| because we don't have anything to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I understand you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| a different perspective on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| but there is an omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| that even the current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| should have at least noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| that this was zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| and then gone further into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| why they think that is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| And clearly the current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Well, there is advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| It's not mailed directly to each property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| nor is that typically required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| But I feel that the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| does reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| on the overall impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| and community interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| and is not to be assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| that it was inadvertently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| as low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2221)|

| 0:46:54| or decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| know, there. But as Commissioner Hill said, you know, no deed goes unpunished. And I personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| you know, support the sector plan amendment and neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Rault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you, Pat. I just want to say a couple of things. And on the record, we do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2834)|
| 0:47:22| motion and a second. But this idea, one of the problems I see with this, the big problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| I see with this is we have a conflict. So the way it is written right now, the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| of this property can't do anything with it. Because there's a conflict between the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| and the zone. And the zone was in place before the plan was in place. So it's incumbent upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| us to fix it. Now, applying commercial zone, I'm not a big fan of that here, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| encompasses a whole lot of other things. And having said that, I would echo what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Browning said. We spent a lot of time on this commission talking about the benefits of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| commercial and the walkability and people being able to walk down the street to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| to have dinner or go to a shop or whatever. We've spent a lot of time talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| And I think I agree with Commissioner Browning that that would be advantageous, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| I would personally want. But getting back to that, I think the idea that we could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| the conflict in the zone to force a property owner to donate their property to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| or let it be maintained as a park because the surrounding people have been allowed access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| to it is preposterous. I don't think that's what we need to be doing here. And I was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2924)|
| 0:48:54| I support the plan amendment because I think it's the right thing to do when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| the property rights. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you. I want to echo what everybody's saying. I don't think in any way this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| anything to do with who owns the property. This is a planning and zoning issue. Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| Federal, wonderful locally owned bank, good stewards of the assets they own. Their bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| as I understand, is technically owned by the depositors. So they are stewards or the assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| in that bank, this being one of them. I place more weight on the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| It was there was a hearings specifically focused like our planning meetings are on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| back in 1976. And the owners of the property requested plan commercial. They got plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Plan commercial is the zoning that was designated for this property. And I place more weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| on that than the sector plan. I think a sector plan can be loose neighborhood meetings where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| you can easily overlook the fact that this was a commercially zoned property. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| know, what if this was someone who borrowed money based on that zoning? What if they owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| half a million dollars on two acres based on the commercial zoning, and we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| to suddenly take that away from them? That could put somebody in a really horrible position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| in terms of knowing that you have what you think you have. And so I believe this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| was intentionally zoned plan commercial, and it should be upheld at plan commercial. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| I plan on supporting the sector plan motion to fix an error on this property. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3047)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| I would agree with Mr. Browning. Yes, I think it would be preposterous if we were requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| the owner to donate or sell a lesser price for a park. I don't think that's really on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| the table right now for discussion. I feel that we might want to refer to a letter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| was submitted by Mr. Murphy, in which he's pointing out the precedent that we might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| setting whenever there is a conflict between a sector plan and an underlying zone. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| I'm sure you've all read that. But we have had situations in the past where we have supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| staff where there was a conflict between the sector plan and the underlying zoning in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| we followed the sector plan. I do have a question for staff if I may. I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| and I hope that you can share with me a comparison between planned commercial and the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3118)|
| 0:52:07| commercial insofar as our ability to review it and insofar as the amount of buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| and other ways of assuaging any impacts to the surrounding single family homes. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| I'm pretty sure no single family home wanted the opportunity to walk to a drive through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| restaurant in order to get something to eat. But staff, please let me know what the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| is between planned commercial and neighborhood commercial insofar as impacts and our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| to review it. Should we deal with the zoning? Maybe we focus on sector plan for now or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| because that's two votes. But right now, we're still discussing the entire both situations. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| let Michelle, if you don't mind responding to Commissioner Korbelik's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| Absolutely. So in the planned commercial zone, there's a peripheral boundary of 50 feet. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| 50 feet in all directions, all the corners of the property would need to have a 50 foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| before a building could be built. Beyond that, there's not really a whole lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| in there. You would see the plan, but there's not really anything other than you would see in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| regular zones or setbacks or building heights or anything like that. This particular use that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| have, the concept that they have placed before you would have to come back as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| to the Planning Commission. And with that, they would have to meet the criteria set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| for those specific uses. I'd have to look up into the ordinance to see exactly what that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| not having done any use on reviews for restaurants. I can do that while you guys are discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| So if I may summarize, the two differences are increased buffering under planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| and some detailed use on review under neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| But you say the uses are pretty comparable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| No, I was talking about the development standards, what you would see when you came back. So the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| under planned commercial, it basically talks about groups of commercial buildings. Actually, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| pull it up on my screen and I'll share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| Sorry, trying to open, get everything pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3277)|
| 0:54:52| Okay, can you guys see my screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| No. Oh, there we go. Yes. Okay. So this is planned commercial zone. The use is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3294)|
| 0:55:02| So under the intent, it's a unified group of commercial buildings that don't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| central business districts included within. It's very vague. It just talks about office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| commercial services and light distribution centers, a child daycare center. That's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| what's allowed. In terms of looking at sizes, it's much bigger than your neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| zone would be. So that's not really relevant in this particular case. This is that 50-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| peripheral boundary that's required. And then beyond that, 50% lot coverage, there's your height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| And the planned commercial does require restrictive covenants. And Mr. Mullins has stated they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| be willing to put some of those uses that staff put in their staff reports. They'd be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3343)|
| 0:55:51| restrict those uses. I'm sure you all have seen that. And then there's the landscaping plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| would be required. It doesn't really go into detail as to what that should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So that's the planned commercial. In terms of your neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| this goes into much more detail as to what's allowed. But it really is to kind of promote more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| talking up here about recurring shopping and personal service needs. So things that you use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| frequently to make your trips convenient. You're supposed to promote walkability and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| that. So these are the uses that are allowed by rights, grocery stores, supplies, clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| those types of things you can see on the list here. Scrolling down. And it really does go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| some detail. Most of the uses are less intense than you would find in other zones. And then these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3393)|
| 0:56:43| are the uses that are required as a use on review. So restaurants would be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| Per Mr. Mullins' Exhibit B, there's, I believe, two restaurants that were proposed. It says food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| on one and coffee on the other. And then shops. So I guess depending on what those shops would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| they would probably not have to come before this board. Most of those were in the use permitted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| right. But if it were one of these uses, then yes, it would have to come before you. And depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| on that use, that would have its own criteria associated with it based on the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| section of the zoning ordinance. And it varies according to each use. I hope that answers your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| question. Could I, for just a minute, Michelle, if you could keep scrolling down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| further to 5.38, 06, 07. So, you know, there are some additional requirements that are included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3447)|
| 0:57:41| Neighborhood Commercial as well associated with the site. I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| Yes, there's some front yard and landscaping requirements, setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3467)|
| 0:57:57| Shade trees are required, an ornamental tree for every 25 feet of linear frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| What I'm wondering is, if the, I still am quite fervently opposed to amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| And so what I'm trying to do, since so far the people who have spoken have been favorable, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| I'm also trying to figure out whether or not we need to rezone it to CN or if we can keep a PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| I do feel that warrants its own discussion. And I would echo Commissioner Smith in saying that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| we should talk more at length about the rezone separately before we make a motion on the rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3519)|
| 0:58:48| Well, in order to have a plan amendment that would allow the PC zone, that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| sector plan amendments to either community commercial, regional commercial, or general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| commercial. And those are three commercial land use designations that are more intense than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| they're proposing, the mixed-use neighborhood center with the commercial neighborhood zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| So choosing between the two commercial options, which I guess is to leave the PC zoning in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3547)|
| 0:59:17| and amend it to the one of those three choices versus approving the applicant's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| I think we would probably prefer to see approving the applicant's request. Because again, that PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| zone, it allows all the way up to like distribution centers, not to say that that's what they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| do, but that intensity would be allowed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you, Michelle. Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Thank you. I want to add to this discussion that Commissioner Hill's comment about no good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3585)|
| 0:59:55| deed going unpunished, I actually feel like what we are looking at is exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| This was a good deed that is presenting what the community wants and what the community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| And it's sitting there and being shown to us. And the property owner didn't have to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3611)|
| 1:00:19| fight any battles to get to that. And neither did the community. But now we're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and there is a conflict with the different plans and the different desires. But it's not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| there was a good deed that was now being punished. It's that there was a good deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| and it really helped guide this property in this community to what is needed now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3637)|
| 1:00:47| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill. One more thing. One more thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| because it relates to what the opposition actually said. Because if we listen to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| the opposition said, they wanted a denial, because they wanted the opportunity to have a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| productive conversation with the property owner about more effective and appropriate uses of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| land. So, it was not a complete, it must be this or it must be that. But it sounded like, in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| words, they would like to have some more productive conversations. So, I think that is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| we should bear in mind. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I guess I feel the need to respond to Commissioner Adams'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| response to, I guess, the old cliche or adage of no good deed goes unpunished. The good deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| was the property owner making it available to the residents. And the good deed was the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| owner paying taxes so that they could use the property. And the good deed was when they called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| and complained about the grass being too high, having somebody go over there and mow the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| Those are good deeds, I think. Now, secondly, the thing, the property was zoned in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3727)|
| 1:02:18| as PC when this subdivision was being developed. So, it did not happen on the tail end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| People knew what they were getting. And I do want to ask either Director Brooks or Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3745)|
| 1:02:34| whichever one deems appropriate. I am not going to ask you to get in the minds of people in 1976| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| or 77 or 2003. But if this occurred today in your department, and we were updating the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3761)|
| 1:02:54| as I look at these maps and I see this big pink elephant sticking out as an oddball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| on the zoning map and on the sector plan map, how would you address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3781)|
| 1:03:12| Commissioner Hamlin, I want to make sure I understand the question. So, are you asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| how we would address it as part if we were updating the sector plan today and we saw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| plan commercial deal? How would you deal with, and then I'm going to just give you a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| context here. You know, we just went through. No, let me let you answer that. I'll go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| next question. Go ahead, please. Okay, thank you. I think how we would address it. I mean, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| this is quite unusual. And this has been on our radar for a little while this past year because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| it's come up in conversation is, you know, we would we would flag this one when we went out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| the community and talk about and talk about the things that you all are discussing today, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| conflicts that this zoning has been here for a long time. And, you know, engaging the county in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| a conversation of, you know, is it realistic for the county and their budget to make this into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| park? And if not, so what you know what just what makes the most sense. So we would be having all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| these types of conversations specifically and try to come up with a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| that makes sense in terms of the land use classification that would be assigned to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| property. Okay, let's let's address the park. How could the county make it a park if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3853)|
| 1:04:21| deed restricted for commercial use only? They couldn't, unless there was some change to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| deed restriction. Nor do I would make any assumption that the county would have money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| to purchase this to make it into a park. Okay, so we have a property that has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| ability to be a park because deed restrictions are very, very difficult to lift. The whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| point of a deed restriction is it runs with the land forevermore. And there are rare occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| where a deed restriction would be lifted. So that's a high bar to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| We just went through recode, massive overhaul in the city. And I was just trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| of an occasion where we took a commercial designation and took that use away and limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| it to residential. In your time at the Planning Department, do you recall a case where we've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| done that? I'm trying to think of a specific example when we were updating the city's new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| code of where we did that. I mean, you know, most of the majority of the commercial went to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| you know, equivalent commercial zone. There were some industrially zoned properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| were being used as a residence. And those were, I can't think specifically which ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| but those were changed to recognize that existing residential use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| Okay, so it was a residential use. It was a previous industrial designation. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| That's correct. Okay. Would you call this, would you say this is a very, very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| maybe the most rare case you've seen in your time in the Planning Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Yes. Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| Commissioners, it is now 2.36 and we've been over an hour and we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| basically on the first item. So let's try to wrap it up. Commissioner Korbelik, if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| minimize your comments. I wanted to answer Commissioner Hill's question by referring again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| to the letter submitted by Mr. Murphy, in which he presents quite a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| where the land use designation in the sector plan is LDR and the underlying zoning was commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| I don't know which application this is. I'm looking at the letter right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| but I would refer you to his letter on page one that provides that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4022)|
| 1:07:11| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| I'd like to call for the question. Thank you. We have a motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4038)|

| 1:10:27| Somebody have their audio on or have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4227)|

| 1:10:48| Location northeast side of North Campbell Station Road, southeast of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Tract information is 60.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4254)|

| 1:11:16| The density proposed is four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| First motion recommendation by staff is approve the northwest county sector plan amendment to rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4281)|

| 1:11:33| Second motion recommendation by staff, approve PR plan residential up to 1.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| because it is consistent with the slope analysis and growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| Mr. Hickey, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4307)|

| 1:12:06| Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Are you representing the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| My name is John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| I represent Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| I'm here for Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Mr. Valiant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| I'd like to make a statement and have a little time to respond if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Well, you have five minutes and you may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| In this zoning, we have requested the sector plan change to a low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| And I noticed that staff recommended rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| If the sector plan is changed to rural residential as opposed to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| this development is dead on arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| This LDR zone is an extension of a low-density residential to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| which is on, I think, the Steel Road property owned by Rusty Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4388)|
| 1:13:17| So we need to have the sector plan changed to LDR instead of rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4397)|
| 1:13:26| We have asked for a density on this of four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| And I can tell staff candidly and the commissioners candidly, I've talked to my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| they can go somewhat lower than that, but they can't go below three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Across the street from this, there's a subdivision that's across Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| This density was set at 2.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| And the one directly to the north of this that I just referenced is 4.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| So this is really consistent with what is going on there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| And that's what we'd ask the commission to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4450)|
| 1:14:19| I'm ready to let opposition speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Fuju Wu, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Or Miss Jennifer Stenstrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| Mr. Wu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| My name is Fuju.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Yes, my name is Fuju Wu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| My address is 2040 Highlands Beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| Knoxville 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I'm here with my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So we are living in the community right across the street from the land is going to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| So we are concerned about the future traffic and then the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| and also the houses built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Because the Campbell Station Road is already in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| And we are worried about and it's supposed to be the low traffic road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| However, if we are going to add in 243 homes there, it's going to add in the pressure to the Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4528)|
| 1:15:39| The lot is close to the fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| And then all the traffic there is going to affect the future fire trucks going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| And also all the community next to the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| So we have severe concern about adding that many houses in the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4557)|
| 1:16:06| Yes, that's my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Mr. Stephen Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Well, I'd just like to comment on the Ball Homes lawyer's statement regarding the subdivisions close to the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4576)|
| 1:16:25| The Highlands subdivision, which is directly across Campbell Station Road from the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| before it was developed, was more of a pasture area on more level land than what is being proposed for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4592)|
| 1:16:41| I don't know exactly what the slope analysis revealed in regards to slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| but I can tell you that it's much more than what the Highlands were before development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| I'm aware of this because if you look on your map directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| my property adjoins the proposed developed area, and I am on the southern border of the proposed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4619)|
| 1:17:11| That's me down there below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| So it is a ridgetop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| It has got a significant slope to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| And regarding the traffic, that would be a result of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| You know, if we were talking about 180 to 240 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| the resulting traffic on Campbell Station Road would be increasing and already overflowing traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4654)|
| 1:17:43| So that's my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Ms. Stenstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Jennifer Stenstrom, 1717 Long Farm Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| So first I wanted to respond to the first comment made about how rural residential doesn't fit the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| It is a way better fit for rural residential than LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| It is not the county's, the resident's, or the planning commission's responsibility for it to work financially for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| So that's the first point that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Also, the hillside protection and slope is being paid more attention to now than it was when the 4.4 dwelling unit per acre and 2.7 in the highlands was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4708)|
| 1:18:42| And then also, I actually spoke with the planning commission last November on an almost identical case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| It's the same acreage, the same road, and the same problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| I'm fairly new to the area, and I delved into the issue as best I can because we're not given a very long time to prepare for these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4734)|
| 1:19:03| And I was going to come here and talk about all the facts and figures, but the planning commission already knows all of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4743)|
| 1:19:13| I wanted to talk about the bigger picture here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Based on the public comments to the planning commission, the comments on social media, and all the citizens I've spoke with directly in the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| the Hardin Valley community is against another big development in not only the general area, but specifically on this narrow, curved road of Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| The citizens of Hardin Valley are tired and frustrated and deflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We're always referred to the growth plan, the hillside and ridgetop protection plan, the northwest county sector plan, the mobility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| There are so many plans and studies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| It's a very confusing process, and the residents don't feel like they have any say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| We are changing Hardin Valley parcel by parcel, month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| These studies are just guidelines and advisory only, but it's time for the residents to be given some clear expectations on what is able to be developed and to have the infrastructure to support it prior to the developments being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4796)|
| 1:20:12| It's concerning that the planning commission and the county commissioners want more involvement from the community, but when the community tries, they are not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| So this would be the fourth subdivision in less than five years on Campbell Station in the short distance from Hardin Valley to Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| And I understand there was a traffic impact letter completed for this case, but I don't think that that letter takes into account the recently rezoned property that's going to add another 120 homes in this short little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4828)|
| 1:20:43| So I would like that to be studied prior to this being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| And I'm not even sure anyone takes into account the Hardin Valley road at school pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| It is a mess, and I fear for the safety of the kids and the other travelers at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| This property is very close to that intersection, and it will just add to the burden and the congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| I also understand that this property, this parcel, is located in the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| So there will be no bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| How are these kids going to get to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| There's no sidewalk on Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| It's an unsafe road to walk on to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| The mobility plan had three solutions for the Campbell Station traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| The case in November that you heard took one of them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| I believe that this one will take another one away, and so then we'll have one solution left for the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| And then after all these homes are constructed, it's going to be a nightmare to finally do the repairs when the funding finally comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4901)|
| 1:21:51| You have another opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| If you can conclude your remarks here briefly because your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| If you can conclude your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I just think that this is a perfect opportunity for the Planning Commission to set a precedent for future rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| If the growth plan, the hillside protection plan, the sector plans are applied as written and to their original intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4927)|
| 1:22:16| then Hardin Valley will remain, the character will remain, and we can support growth in a responsible way and keep the residents happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4936)|
| 1:22:25| And I think that this parcel should remain agricultural land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you, Ms. Stenstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Mr. Valiant, do you have additional time if you'd like to make some other additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Yes, this is Ryan Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I got a few comments I'd like to say to address some of the concerns that have been brought up out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| The southern portion of this site, after consulting with our design engineers, we understand that there's some slopes back there that are not usable, and we have no intent to use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4967)|
| 1:23:00| And concerning the traffic, we're aware of the concerns of the traffic, and during the design phase of this subdivision, we'll certainly work with Knox County Public Works to address any concerns that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4980)|
| 1:23:14| With that said, there will be a full traffic ladder completed as part of a concept plan that will come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=4994)|
| 1:23:23| And also on the traffic, there was a system-wide crash analysis completed by Knox County out there in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| Campbell Station Road ranked 114 out of 563 in Knox County at that time, and that equated to 1.635 crashes per million vehicles traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5011)|
| 1:23:46| So I understand these people's concerns about traffic, but I don't believe it's nearly as bad as what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5026)|
| 1:23:56| And as far as utilities out there, there are utilities available at the site, which includes public water, public sewer, and electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5036)|
| 1:24:07| So I think there have been changes in Horn Valley specifically related to utilities that are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5047)|
| 1:24:15| If you guys have any questions, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you, Mr. Hickey. Commissioner Hale, do you have something you want to say before we proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5058)|
| 1:24:30| Thanks, Chair Phillips. I think it'd be more appropriate after this vote, if we can deal with it before the next case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Yeah, Mr. Valiant beat me to the punch. I was concerned about that amount of density on this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5079)|
| 1:24:53| and I was going to recommend the three-per-the-acre just because that's pretty middle-of-the-road LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| like we've been talking about on some other pieces in Hardin Valley that were contiguous with developed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| Here you've got the LDR, you know, just to the north, and obviously the subdivision across the street that recently got put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| and I think there's a couple more down Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| So, you know, Ball has dealt with the hillside and slope protection criteria before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| This is not their first attempt at doing that, and I think they've done a fairly good job at those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| So, I would support the sector plan change from rural residential or, excuse me, agricultural to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5129)|
| 1:25:39| and I would obviously be following that up later with a motion on lowering the density request to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| and being very, very attentive when they submit a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| So, I would like to make that motion of ag to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I have a couple of questions for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| My first question would be how does low-density residential differ from rural residential in terms of density and development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5170)|
| 1:26:22| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I'm the planner that was working on the staff report for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| Low-density residential is the designation that we use in the planned growth areas of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5189)|
| 1:26:39| that are typically areas that are ideal for low-density residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| The rural residential designation is limited for the rural areas of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| and that's generally limited at two dwelling units an acre but can be considered for up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5215)|
| 1:27:05| as per the rules of the growth policy plan that allow for a traffic impact letter to be submitted on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5225)|
| 1:27:19| related to impacts caused by the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| My second question is do you mind turning on the hillside protection layer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5250)|
| 1:27:39| Looking at the property, all the surrounding properties, there are about three of them that are planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| I see 4.4 dwelling units, less than two dwelling units, and less than 2.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| But looking at the slope analysis, they seem pretty steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Were those properties considered at the same level of density as the one we're looking at now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| Because they seem like they have quite a bit of slope, but they have a smaller dwelling unit per acre designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5286)|
| 1:28:17| All right, this is Liz again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| I will have to look and see what the staff recommendation was on the one that fronts on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5305)|
| 1:28:37| I'm sure slope analysis was done for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| If you turn on the zoning layer as well as the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5327)|
| 1:28:57| they're referring to the low density residential and the rural residential around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| They seem like they have a lower amount than four, or even three for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| So I just, it seems like it would be in line to keep it at a lower density just because of the surrounding developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5352)|
| 1:29:22| to have the same amount of slope, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| I suppose that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5368)|
| 1:29:42| Liz, while you're looking at that, can we move on to another commissioner and come back to Commissioner Dent's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5382)|
| 1:30:06| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| If you can do that, and then we'll come back to you in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5413)|
| 1:30:22| Unmute, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Everybody seems to have some hiccups in their technology off and on, and I just experienced one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| I just wanted to affirm the Planning Commission is supposed to, we are an impartial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| And we have been especially told not to look at the economics or the fiscal ability of an applicant to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5440)|
| 1:30:50| And we have also understood that we're not to show any favoritism to an applicant, regardless whether they're a good developer or a bad developer or an unknown developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5450)|
| 1:31:03| We treat everyone quite equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| So with that said, I would like, I have a question for staff and then some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| My question is to, I suppose, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| I'd like to understand what the existing traffic volumes and impacts are on Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5478)|
| 1:31:27| And I would like to understand a little bit about the three solutions identified in the mobility plan for Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5487)|
| 1:31:43| Yes, Mr. Korbelick, this is Jim Snowden, Moss County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| Be happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Currently, right now, the latest count we have on Campbell Station shows about 6,000 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| The capacity that a two-lane roadway, I guess, would exhibit before experiencing significant problems is between 10,000 and 12,000 cars per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5517)|
| 1:32:07| So essentially, Campbell Station is exhibiting about half of its current capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| We do have, we did get an engineer to look at a couple of, or actually three different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| One kind of on alignment, one east and then one west of the existing alignment of Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5539)|
| 1:32:27| And to kind of, to go deeper into that, TDOT is doing a I-40 corridor analysis throughout the entirety of the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5547)|
| 1:32:37| And we've asked that consultant to actually do a little bit deeper analysis for Campbell Station, not only at the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5557)|
| 1:32:45| but also to Hardin Valley and give us a little bit more analysis of those three alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| as well as some costing for potential use in the TPO's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5573)|
| 1:33:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Asin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| My apologies. Okay, just a quick, couple quick comments because we're, we've got a long agenda yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| I would like to point out to the commissioners, and so I can study on it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| the zoning for the PR that is adjacent to the property all indicates a density less than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| So we do not know what the actual densities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| And we also know that in December of 2012, there was a rural residential that was approved at 1.93 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5617)|
| 1:33:50| It's my hope and feeling that since we have in the past as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| supported staff's analysis of slope carrying capacity for density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5636)|
| 1:34:03| and that we recognize somewhat unwillingly that the growth policy plan and the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5643)|
| 1:34:11| although not, although totally out of date, still should be the guiding philosophy for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| I would suggest that we follow the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| And because I feel it's a good one. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Asin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| I think along the same lines as Commissioner Korbelik, that since this is not in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| I don't think this should be changed to low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| It should either be kept as agricultural or as rural residential because it's not in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| And also with the hillside protection and slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| I think it is important for us to follow that slope analysis and not to zone this for more than 1.52 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| Thank you, Commissioner. Just before we go to Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| I want to ask Commissioner Uten, when we come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| I know you've made a motion on the low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| but we will need a justification for the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| So if you could be thinking about that and I'll let me go to Commissioner Scott Smith and then come back to you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5725)|
| 1:35:33| Commissioner Smith. Thanks. Yeah, I just wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| I don't see how we don't consider these tracks in this location of Hardin Valley to be in the growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5740)|
| 1:35:50| I mean, we are it is 2000 feet from the only grocery store in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| It's about 2400 feet from the school. They've just built another new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| I mean, we heard a presentation at Agenda Review and we've got a ton of people moving to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5764)|
| 1:36:12| And, you know, to say we're going to hold our density at one and two units per acre in these areas is just a really inefficient use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5772)|
| 1:36:24| I mean, the fewer people we accommodate on this track means the more tracks are going to have to be taken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| and developed to accommodate the number of people we have coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| Honestly, the difference in two and three units an acre when you build a subdivision out, it's not noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5796)|
| 1:36:44| You could not ride in the subdivision and tell me if it's two or three, but you will provide an efficient use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5804)|
| 1:36:52| And in this location, I mean, this is the center of Hardin Valley and people are moving here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5812)|
| 1:37:00| and people want to be down there near new schools. So when you get new schools, you're going to get more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| Just my opinion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Commissioner, I don't disagree with you. However, you know, doing these one at a time, we need to be looking at the broader picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5830)|
| 1:37:20| Now, I think the staff recommendation is appropriate given the information we have and what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| I mean, I think if we're going to look at higher densities, we need to redo our sector plans and address them accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5846)|
| 1:37:36| Chair recognizes Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| I agree 100% with Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Phillips, I certainly understand your point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5860)|
| 1:37:52| But, you know, we've got professionals telling us, you know, this road is not even 50% utilized at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5872)|
| 1:38:00| You know, going back to that presentation we saw, you know, yesterday, I mean, our employment in this area is increasing quicker than our home starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5880)|
| 1:38:10| I mean, that's that's insane. And when we have a, you know, a good solid development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| or we're not even going to be able to tell the difference between two to three, I'm just all in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5896)|
| 1:38:26| Thank you, Commissioner. I'm going to turn it back and go back to Mel. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5906)|
| 1:38:34| Just briefly, I want to make it clear that I'm not opposed to density and I'm not opposed to more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| I just think it's very important that we place that greater density in the appropriate locations and not on a hillside or steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5920)|
| 1:38:50| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| I'd like to echo what Commissioner Eason just said. I'm also not against density or development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| But when you have these different slopes, yes, we have professionals saying that there's not a lot of use of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| But we also have other professionals saying that there is a lot of slope here and we need to consider the density per acre of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5951)|
| 1:39:19| My earlier question, I might not have been clear enough. It might have been more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| Just showing this zoning map here now that you can see less than 4.4, less than 2.7, less than 2 at the three closest neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5965)|
| 1:39:35| And if you lay the slope analysis on top of that or the slope hillside protection, you'll see that they have a lot of slope as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| So I suppose the point I was making is that we see instances of similar properties, maybe not similar acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| where there's a lot of slope and that dictated a smaller density per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| So we just want to make sure that we're respecting the homes that are going to be built and the people that have to maintain them once they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| And when you have a lot of slope, then you just have issues with development down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6003)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Uden, if you don't mind, you made the initial motion. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| I did. All right. Would you repeat your motion and again, include a justification for the low density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6019)|
| 1:40:29| Yeah, my motion was to amend the sector plan from agricultural to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| And as far as, you know, the comments about the growth policy plan, we all know that that thing is way out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6036)|
| 1:40:45| There's a lot of momentum of even getting away with that plan and redoing general plans and letting the general plans carry the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6045)|
| 1:40:54| I think Brooks can shed some light on that and update these sector plans and make them all more efficient so we don't have layer upon layer upon layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6054)|
| 1:41:04| Obviously, that's going to take time. As Commissioner Smith said, I mean, this is the fastest growing area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6064)|
| 1:41:13| It's the only place in the county that's got three new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| So the standard for approving this plan amendment, you know, there's four and I could probably pick three of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6077)|
| 1:41:27| The trends in the development could be one, introduce new roads, utilities or other things that have made it more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6087)|
| 1:41:38| There's three new schools. Hardin Valley got widened out through there since this thing's been, since the sector plan has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| So I think there's plenty of reasons why this could be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| Thank you, Commissioner. Let's go ahead. Let me get another, let's get another second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| Real quick, Pat, and I would point out that the other commissioners are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| I would say less than 4.4 or around 2.7, you know, there's no guarantee that this one's going to come in at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6124)|
| 1:42:14| It very well could come in at 2.5, but the engineers and the developer have to be able to take that time to be able to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6134)|
| 1:42:23| spend that kind of dollar before they come into us and submit that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| I would be frankly surprised if it would be a little bit less than three. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Second, who seconded that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Commissioner Roth, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| So a motion by Commissioner Ood and seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve a Northwest County Sector Plan amendment to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6160)|
| 1:42:50| given the changing patterns in the area, improvements in infrastructure, and I guess the outdatedness of the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6170)|
| 1:43:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Call the roll, Ms. Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Yes. Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you. Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| I'll circle back. Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| I don't see Commissioner Graf back yet. He was having difficulty as well. Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Commissioner Scotsmith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| Six ayes and five nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| I was trying to vote, and I was kicked off and made a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| May I still vote, Mr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Yes, you may still vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| I do not want to vote for the sector plan amendment that Commissioner Uten proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Thank you. Do we have others that were briefly bumped off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| Right now, we are at six ayes and six nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| And we were looking, Commissioner Eddie Smith needed to leave the meeting for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| I don't see that he's back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| And we were looking for Commissioner Graf, who was also having difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| At this point, we do not have any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Sure. Commissioner Hill, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| I wanted to hold this until after this vote, but it couldn't have come at a better time, thanks to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| And this pertains to internet drops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| And I want to share with you all some of the things that have occurred in the past couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| And I feel that we should make some reasonable accommodation on an internet drop, whether it be trying to call the Commissioner and get the vote in, rather than, you know, just vote and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6324)|
| 1:45:39| And I want to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| Commissioner Eddie Smith was unable to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| I think it was last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| It could have been two meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| And then he missed the discussion as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| And it goes on to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| Council is now going to send it back to us for the very reason that they believe that the vote could have been different had he been a part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6355)|
| 1:46:05| So, you know, if you're willfully leaving the meeting, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| But if it's a temporary drop, and Commissioner Boyer, I have no idea how she was going to vote on that last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6370)|
| 1:46:17| But I feel like she deserved a vote on that last case, because she immediately contacted us and said, my internet dropped, and I'm trying to get back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6377)|
| 1:46:28| So is it and I think we've either either this body had a call in vote, or city council had a call in vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| But I don't think we should go to the links where we hold up the meeting forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| But maybe one phone call and put it on speaker could serve, you know, the will allow that vote to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6400)|
| 1:46:49| Thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Just if there's a way to text, if there's someone, Ms. Cannon, who's keeping the votes, just a way to text them quickly, because what I just experienced, I was totally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6411)|
| 1:47:06| And then it was just gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| And when I tried to, it was reconnecting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| And then it made me a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| It was like being locked in a closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| I could hear you and see you, but you could not hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| If I could have texted somebody, then I could have said my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| In the case of Commissioner Graf, since we're at a tie right now, I think it would be worth it to, if it's possible, to hold this until he's back on and then redo this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6447)|
| 1:47:39| He's back on now, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6459)|

| 1:47:54| So we do have a motion by Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth, to approve the Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment to LDR, based on the increase in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6474)|
| 1:48:13| being built in the Hard Valley area, the date of the urban growth plan being outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6493)|
| 1:48:26| Commissioner, do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6506)|

| 1:48:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| Well, West Notch Utility District just got through spending about $80 million on upgrades to the whole sewer system down through there and installed a new plant to handle all this new growth for Hard Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6518)|
| 1:48:49| So, you know, that certainly would be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6531)|

| 1:49:11| That might be easier, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Well, I don't know what's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6553)|

| 1:52:24| amendment to rural residential and approve the PR plan residential up to 1.52 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| 1200 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6751)|
| 1:52:39| Now, the motion is to approve the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Northwest County sector plan for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6762)|

| 1:53:23| I'm sure it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6803)|

| 1:54:17| So I would like to recommend that we change the zoning from agricultural to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| and lower the applicant's request from one to five to one to three per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| So the planned residential with one to three per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6870)|

| 1:55:25| I can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6925)|

| 1:55:49| He's on, but I don't think he's getting adequately connected. So let's bypass Commissioner Graf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| and... Yes, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=6957)|

| 1:58:03| Chair Phillips, did I misunderstand your comments a few minutes ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| I guess you did. Yes. About Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| Yes. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I didn't misunderstand it? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Did I miss it? What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| I said we'd go back to Ms. Boyer and we didn't. So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| Dory, do you want to go back to the previous one to item number nine and read the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7106)|
| 1:58:35| so Ms. Boyer can vote? Would that be number eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| Yes. Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Okay. Okay. And I'm reading both the motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7122)|
| 1:58:50| Yes. Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7130)|

| 1:59:38| Your vote would be yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| That would change that to nine ayes, five nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| Thank you. And on the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7187)|

| 2:00:21| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Would you like to go first? Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| Opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| All right. Mr. Schubert or Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7228)|
| 2:00:37| Okay. Gonzalez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| All right. Your name, please, and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| I'm not the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| All right. Thank you. Mr. Schubert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| Mrs. Schubert, and I'm actually on for item number 14B, Pine Grove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7255)|
| 2:01:04| This is item 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Okay. All right. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| You need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| Yes, sir. It's Corey Schubert. My address is 6904 Pine Grove Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| You have five minutes, and there is another individual that would like to speak. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| if you could reserve some time for that, please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| Absolutely. Thank you. So, I felt like this was an appropriate time to speak on current issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| for those of us who rely on Pine Grove Road. Just to jump into it and begin, there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7294)|
| 2:01:41| speed limit signs posted on Pine Grove Road, and due to the proximity to Highway 40, I think a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| of people just jump off the interstate and come right over here and think they can go 70 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| an hour. Unfortunately, it's not set up for that. Also, we have a steep incline at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| of Pine Grove coming off of Strawberry Plains Pike. This incline is consistently wet, and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| have a cold day or morning, it is ice, which makes it very difficult for one or more vehicles to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| navigate, especially if either of them are larger or carrying a trailer. We also have some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7336)|
| 2:02:25| with water running across the road. The water running across the road brings gravel and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| debris. It also creates an issue with standing water on the road. Much of the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7352)|
| 2:02:41| at the roadfront is underwater when we have moderate to heavy rainfall. And lastly, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| severe narrow spots on Pine Grove Road. One or more vehicles are not able to go through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| together, you know, two mid-sized vehicles at the same time, and it really causes an issue with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| of us having to reverse back down the road and that type of thing. So all of these things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7380)|
| 2:03:08| hazardous road conditions for the current population. If we have this proposed rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| and I believe the land use classification that they're moving to is going to accommodate 5 to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| dwellings per acre, and we could increase the housing on Pine Grove Road by a minimum of 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| or up to 83 dwellings, which would be, you know, a large number of people coming up and down Pine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| Grove. It could be, if we multiply it by the number of vehicles owned per household in the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| up to 156 vehicles per day. Now, of course, I'm not sure what they're planning to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| but just to give us an estimate of growth, I feel like these issues need to be addressed for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| safety of the individuals using Pine Grove Road currently before we move to increase the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7435)|
| 2:04:04| which I'm definitely not against. You know, there's sufficient job opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| and I would love nothing more than to see our area grow, but in a responsible way. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| Thank you, Ms. Huber. Mr. Murphy, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| Mr. Chairman, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road. I'm speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| Alliance. And specifically, I had one issue I wanted to bring up, the justification for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| rezoning change listed in the staff report. It speaks about, you know, that there is an increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| need for housing, and that the proposed rezoning would create an opportunity for more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| And that justification is pretty generic. It seems to apply, it could apply to almost any parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7484)|
| 2:04:52| in the land use classification in the county that allows residential uses underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| You know, that's a fairly, it's a fairly weak justification. We really want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7497)|
| 2:05:04| maybe a stronger justification for that area. This is an interesting parcel as well. It's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| the urban growth boundary. So, you know, it is, you know, designated, you know, the city could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| potentially annex it, or, you know, the county could provide services. But I'm not aware of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| plan for actually, you know, how services are generally going to be provided in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| And that's something that we think, you know, before there's rezonings, you know, to up, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| know, out of the ag zone, that really the county kind of, you know, either the city needs to annex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| it and provide, you know, a plan of service, or the county needs to understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| how it's going to provide services in that area. Services and infrastructure being more than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| the roads and utilities, you know, the electric and water and sewer, but also in schools, parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| recreation, and more connectivity, as well as emergency services in that area. So that's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| that you consider, you know, is that actually being provided well? Has all that been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| to an extent where it's appropriate to start rezoning from ag to planned residential here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. All right. Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| Thank you, Chairman. Well, I just, we feel our request is reasonable, and it's in line with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7571)|
| 2:06:26| growth plan and the sector plan. And we feel that there's, you know, there aren't any hillside issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| to speak of. So we feel that both the rezoning and density request are reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| All right. Thank you. Thank you. Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7599)|
| 2:06:47| Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, because when the opposition spoke, there was a reference of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7607)|

| 2:08:02| applicant, my goodness, would you briefly address the provision of water and sewer to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=7682)|

| 2:18:22| I'm here, Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| All right. Would you like to go? I don't think we have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| There's no opposition. I just ask that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| rezone the property based on staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| I make a motion that we approve planned residential up to three dwelling units and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| We have a motion, a second. Chair will recognize both Commissioner Corblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8326)|
| 2:18:55| Yes, thank you. I had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| Usually, the difficulties with property is the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| Your situation is quite the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| You're on, as I counted it out, about two-thirds of the site is prime or significant farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8351)|
| 2:19:19| and about a half of it is either floodway or flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| And my question to you, sir, is how do you plan on developing that property to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| protect both the prime farmland area and to mitigate the floodway, floodplain issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8370)|
| 2:19:41| Yes, ma'am. Good question, Commissioner Corblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| This property will be attached to the property to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| This is, we acquired this piece after we acquired what I've called the west piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8388)|
| 2:19:58| And we have, and we do have a concept that will appear in front of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| next or this commission next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| And it does, and we did expedite the engineering on this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| because we knew the challenges on the front end with the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| So, we wanted to go ahead and make sure that we could accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| a subdivision that met all the subdivision regulations with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| We have met on site not only with concerned citizens, but also with Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| Leo, and three or four other engineers on their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| They've seen our concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| We will be staying up above the 500-year flood line with all our infrastructure and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8439)|
| 2:20:47| house seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| And we, in the back, we're going to be offering two-acre and 30-acre parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| So, a homeowner will have a house up out of the flood area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| but their property will go all the way down to the creek bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| And again, this concept will be appearing in front of you all next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| And they will be, we're, this whole parcel, everything combined, it's 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8466)|
| 2:21:11| and we're only putting 42 single-family houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Eight of the lots are going to be two to three-acre lots that will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| all the way down to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8481)|
| 2:21:21| I'd like to just point out that if we ever can convince the commissioners and city council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8481)|
| 2:21:29| proceed with an update of the general plan, which I believe everybody who's involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| any aspect of this would like to see done, it would be helpful that we recognize the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| vitality of our prime agricultural farmlands in the update of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| But I'm sorry, I'm interrupting the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| Proceed, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| I just have a quick question, whether the applicant or Jim Snowden with transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8518)|
| 2:22:04| could answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| What plan is in place for the intersection of West Emory and Beaver Ridge Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| I'm just curious to address traffic and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8532)|
| 2:22:20| Yes, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| This is Jim Snowden with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| Yeah, we receive a lot of questions about that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| Two legs of that intersection, the northbound and I guess the east, the north and east approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| are state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| TDOT maintains those, so we only maintain the leg that comes off of it and goes to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8557)|
| 2:22:44| We actually met with the state this week and asked them to consider a partnership with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8564)|
| 2:22:53| We're drafting a letter to the Commissioner of Transportation to try to encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| We have put some funds in our upcoming fiscal 2022 budget to start the engineering on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8580)|
| 2:23:07| but we are looking for the state to carry the bulk of the construction costs due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| the fact that they control two of the three legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| But we are putting money in for the design of the improvements, which will include turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| lanes on all approaches and a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| That's fantastic to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| But seeing no other comments, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| Karen, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8615)|

| 2:23:48| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8628)|

| 2:23:56| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Commissioner Cormillac?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| 12 ayes, zero nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| Next item is number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| This is a sector plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| The applicant is Smithfield Homes, Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| Location, west side of Tazewell Pike, southwest of Ken Mills Point Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| The tract is 76.26 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| Present plan is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| And the proposed plan is low-density residential and PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| The density proposed is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| The first motion recommendation by staff is to deny the northeast county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| to low-density residential because it does not meet the criteria for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| It is not supported by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| Second motion, approve PR zoning with up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| because it is consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| sector plan and the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| Mr. Sanderson, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| I'd like to actually go ahead and go first, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| Again, representing Smithfield Homes on this piece of property that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| under contract just north of the Gibbs School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| I'm going to start out by just saying we do not want, we don't need five units per acre and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8746)|
| 2:25:54| want to reduce our request down to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| Two units per acre will allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| have enough homes and justify amenities, green space, a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| playground, something that we put in all our Karns and all our halls and all our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| PAL locations that we get the three units or four units or five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| But this area is obviously not neglected, but does not fall in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8780)|
| 2:26:28| And that's why staff had to recommend the recommendation of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| But my argument would be that you have a new $30 million school less than a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| and you do have an area that people desire to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| And as a developer and a home builder, we would like to have the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| build more than just 76 homes, which 76 homes would be one unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| and allow us to do up to two units per acre and provide, like I said, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8811)|
| 2:26:57| and other amenities that we know our buyers and particularly Smithville home buyers value heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8817)|
| 2:27:06| Another misconception, I think, about one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| lots or when you zone a piece of property one unit per acre is that you're going to get larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| And I would point out that just because the property would be zoned one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8835)|
| 2:27:22| the lots, the house, the floor plans, the price, they're all going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Here's how more of them or less of them. We'd still go in there with the same product that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| would intend to build on two units per acre versus one unit per acre. We think the two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| will still have, we're only going to be using almost half the property. So the other half of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| the property will be designated as larger lots that we will run utilities to and either maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| build a larger estate home on it or just sell the land and lot with the utilities improved on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8869)|
| 2:27:59| That property would be closest to Campbell's Point. Those are higher end, nicer homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| So we will be on the more of the southwest piece of property with our two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| I will leave it at that and save my time for any comments and questions from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| commission or staff. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sanderson. Chair, I recognize Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road. I'm speaking on behalf of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| Planning Alliance. We're asking you to support the staff recommendation to deny the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8913)|
| 2:28:40| amendment and then support the rezoning it up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8920)|
| 2:28:47| We understand this is an area that's a lot like the North Campbell Station Road property. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| nearby schools that have been built right at the edge of the plan growth area on the boundary with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| the rural area. That creates a lot of development pressure in an area that is designated rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| I want to be clear. In 2016, the Northeast County sector plan was updated. That's five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| And there was a lot of discussion in the Corryton meeting that talked about this area. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| why you see a swath of agriculture sector plan land use designation. It was intentionally set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8958)|
| 2:29:25| aside that this whole area outside of plan growth area be agricultural because that way of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8965)|
| 2:29:33| the number of multi-generational farms that are still out in operation in that area and agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| is an industry in the Northeast sector. The sense of place that offers, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| So we have this conflict. I agree and KCPA agrees that the growth plan is outdated. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| absolutely support a thoughtful update to the land use to the growth plan map. But as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8991)|
| 2:29:58| that, we can support the idea of adding more tools in there to preserve agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| and sense of place in the rural areas to continue to give Knox County some kind of connection to its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| past and agrarian roots out there. And this is a prime example of something that's called out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9011)|
| 2:30:21| the Northeast sector plan that there really should be tools and accommodations for conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| subdivisions that would support taking a parcel like this and preserving part of it for agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9026)|
| 2:30:33| use while giving a developer density bonuses or something for clustering their houses on one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| But that's not the kind of proposal that we see from land developers. So that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| that's why there's a lot of opposition here to, you know, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9044)|
| 2:30:55| to the higher densities. So anyways, KCPA, we support the growth plan as is. We support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| we would love to see it updated. We support the recommendation from staff to deny the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| and rezoning it one to one unit per acre. And we really encourage developers to look at conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| subdivisions in particular to help try and figure out how they can bring housing and preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| agriculture in the rural areas of the county. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Karen Richards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9077)|
| 2:31:26| She available? I don't see Ms. Richards. Comments from staff and commission? Ms. Korbelick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9086)|
| 2:31:35| Just a quick question. One of the exhibits attached to this application is the northern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9095)|
| 2:31:45| half of the site shown on this exhibit, and it says it's a green belt application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9105)|
| 2:31:54| I'd like to know more about that and perhaps staff could address that. It was dated, where's the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| Where's the date? Well, anyway, I don't see a date on it, but it's 33.62 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9120)|
| 2:32:09| and it was recorded in 2014, and it says green belt app. I'd like to know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9129)|
| 2:32:19| Ms. Korbelick, if I believe it's mentioned green belt, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| a part of the property assessor's office and how it's taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9143)|
| 2:32:31| Well, it's... Oh, okay. Oh, that's how it's taxed. Okay, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9151)|
| 2:32:41| Can you all hear me now? This is Karen Richards. Yes, Ms. Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9161)|
| 2:32:47| Is it okay to speak now? Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Sure. It's Karen Richards. I live at 8206 Campbell's Point Road in Coryton. We're kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9168)|
| 2:32:54| of right next door to the proposed subdivision here, and I'm speaking on behalf of pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| all of our neighbors here today. I work from home, and I've got some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| whereas most people are working, so I'm kind of speaking on everyone's behalf, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| Go ahead. I would like to read a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| Kathy Corum is one of our neighbors. I'd just like to read a letter from her and just make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| a couple of other points. I'll try to be quick since it's getting late. This is to the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| County Commission regarding the subject we're talking about. My name is Kathy Corum. I live...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| My husband and I live at 8200 Point View Lane. Our property borders the now-planned subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| We purchased our lot and built our home in 1991. In fact, other than an existing rancher on Stony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9216)|
| 2:33:43| View Lane, we were the first to build in Campbell's Point subdivision. My main concern is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| preservation of the old road which borders our property. What most people think of as a gully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| is actually the historic Coryton-Maynardville Road. This information was passed on to me by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9233)|
| 2:33:59| several of the old-timers in the area who knew that I was interested in local history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| I went to the McClellan Collection years ago and found it on older maps listed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| Tabler Lane. Originally, this land was the Tabler Farm. She says another concern is the cave system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9249)|
| 2:34:17| that runs throughout this area. Just a few yards into the field that borders our property is a cave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| The former owner, Mr. Osborne, filled it in with rocks after we built because he was afraid that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| my then four-year-old son would crawl in it. According to two spelunkers who came here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| five or six years ago, the cave runs under the subdivision and connects to Campbell's Cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| behind the aforementioned rancher on Stony View Lane. And I mean, we all know about the cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| system that runs in this area and the rock. So many times in the 90s, my husband made many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9286)|
| 2:34:54| futile attempts to dig up rocks in our yard only to find that they were never ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9294)|
| 2:35:00| At the time we built, we were told that we could not have underground utilities because of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| Our contractor said that our sewer installation costs more than that of West Knoxville due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| the amount of rock. I'm afraid that excavating and dynamiting might upset the bedrock in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| area, causing damage to the foundations of existing homes or worse. A creek runs through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9316)|
| 2:35:22| the property that is being considered for rezoning. Many times it overflows its bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| This could be an issue for future lot owners as well as for the preservation of the integrity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| the creek itself. The last point of concern is the fact that we are actually on a fault line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| According to a lot owner close to us, it is recorded in Knox County. This person wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| know if we had earthquake insurance. I shrugged this off until a few years ago when we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| strong tremor which sent my neighbors and us into the cul-de-sac to stand. We do have occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9351)|
| 2:35:57| you know, where you can feel the shift. I would like to know if any of these issues have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| discovered in the deeds or records which recently, which have been recently transferred or researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9361)|

| 2:36:13| Thank you, Ms. Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Sure. And I've got just a couple more points, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| Can you wrap it up real quick because your time is up. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| Okay. I'll try to be quick here. I think everybody shares, you know, all her concerns. The main thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| is we are on top of rock. And most of our neighbors down here have lived for at least 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| years. We personally have been here for 18 years since 2003, early 2003. So we all know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| standing water, because there's just nowhere for it to go, the standing water at the bottom of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9400)|

| 2:36:50| their basements flood. There's a field for a larger lot that has, you know, it's a couple acres. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| have horses back there. There's standing water even right now, despite several days of sun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| because it doesn't sink down. It only leaves by evaporation. I just think, you know, there's ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9419)|
| 2:37:06| to mitigate, there's drainage. I'm not an engineer or geologist, but there's just nothing you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| with a lot of rock. And I just think that a lot of changes this close to Campbell's Point, clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9431)|
| 2:37:17| the land, adding a lot of concrete, I just think you're making yourself very susceptible to future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| losses. Because like I say, most of our neighbors have lived here for 20 plus years. They know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| situation. If a lot of buildings come in and things change, and they're flooding Merson's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| you know, they've been here for 20 years, they know what is causing the, you know, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| more flooding, more problems, they're going to know the reason and it's just going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| The last point is just like many of the others on the call, these concerns, these big subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| and the schools. Yes, we have a brand new middle school. But our elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9469)|
