| 0:02:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Under the Mayor's report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Oh, let me recognize Attorney Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| Pardon me, Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| I apologize for interrupting the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| But there is an item that I have distributed to all the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| which is styled a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| appointing Finbar Saunders to serve as city council's representative on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| As you know, the first meeting in January is now going to be on January the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| And so the pension board representative's term runs out on December the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| So I was requested to prepare this resolution to bring to council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| And if it is council's pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| it would need to be added to the agenda by motion if someone is so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=207)|

| 0:03:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Councilman Grieve, is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Oh, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| No, we're not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Well, oh, we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| We don't need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| It's been added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Now we are at the mayor's report and have a few remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| This is not a typical council meeting, and I will be making a few unusual remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| As you know, Saturday is a special day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| We will be inaugurating our mayor-elect, Madeline Rojero, and four new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Mark Campin, who will represent the 5th District, and Finbar Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| George Wallace, and Marshall Starr, who serve at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| The inauguration is at 10 a.m. at the Jacobs Building at Chill Highway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| A reception will follow, after which the new council will choose a vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| and make other appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| I will be returning to council to serve with Councilmembers Palmer, Della Volpe, Grieve, and Pablis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| and the newly elected council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Certainly I've enjoyed my time as mayor, but I'll look forward to taking my seat to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| Also, we're going to miss Councilmembers Woodhull, Roddy, Bailey, and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| You have been great colleagues and have served the city with distinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| and I know we will appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Now I think I have something for each of you, if you could hold up one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=318)|
| 0:05:31| Give us a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=336)|
| 0:05:56| All right, I'd like to invite Councilman Thomas, Vice Mayor Bailey, Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=356)|
| 0:06:10| and Councilman Woodhull, if you would join me out here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=370)|
| 0:06:25| Now we have a little something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| We have appreciation for each one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| This one is for Charles Thomas, and it says, it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| the City of Knoxville Certificate of Appreciation presented to Charles Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| for his dedicated service as a member of the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Presented by the Knoxville City Council and is honored the Mayor Daniel Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Charles Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=419)|
| 0:07:09| Care for any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| I just wanted to thank everybody, all my colleagues in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| It's been a really, really rich experience, and I don't feel like saying goodbye to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| because I think even the ones staying and the ones leaving, they will stay in touch with some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| I again want to thank the people in the City Council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| For a newbie like myself who came on board kind of midstream, they made it so easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| It was just a really, really good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Also, the people who worked for the city, all the people that worked in the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and the people who worked on the streets gave me a tremendous appreciation for the employees of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| And I understand in the deepest sense now that for most of them, maybe all of them, what they do is just not a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| They are inspired to do what they can for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| They have pride in the city, and it's really affirmed my belief in the way a government can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| So I want to thank all of you, and thank you again for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| It's beautiful. I'll always remember it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Thank you, Councilman. And the next one, I will not read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| It's the same wording, and this one is for Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=507)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you, Mayor. This is certainly an undeserved recognition, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| It has been my pleasure to serve on Council for the past eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and certainly couldn't have done so without the support of my incredible family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| my husband Patrick, who's here tonight, and my three daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| And as Councilmember Thomas said, we have the best people in the world that work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| And working with them every day, not only the folks in the city recorder's office, Cindy and Melissa and Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| but the directors and the feet on the street, the police officers, the firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| the public service workers who are out there providing great services for our citizens every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| make it a pleasure to represent the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| And it has certainly only been my pleasure to serve in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you very much. It's very well deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Now the next one is for Councilman Chris Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=571)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Just like the other Councilmembers said, it's been an exciting eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| I'm very grateful to just the amazing staff, the city workers, my colleagues, our council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| just a lot of amazing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| And I think that we were lucky to be part of a trajectory that is still moving upwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| We've got a wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| I know it would be bizarre if young people are actually watching this on TV, but if you are, get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| You know, think about running for city council in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| We have a wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=622)|

| 0:10:44| Mayor, I'd just like to echo the words of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| It's been a quality experience, gratifying, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| Let's give them a standing ovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| It's been eight years of their time and service, and they deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=660)|

| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| We are now ready for reports of council members, if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| No reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| I just wanted to report on the pension task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| They've been meeting some time now, I think since back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| They've been in a fact-finding mode and trying to figure out how it all works, facts and information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=726)|
| 0:12:15| meeting with Mike Cherry, the actuary in Nashville, Bud Gilbert, the pension board attorney, Larry Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=735)|
| 0:12:25| both police and fire chief, Bill Mason, another pension attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| and they've now come to the point where they're trying to determine if there is a problem in sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| and if so, what they might recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| So as our plan all along, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| we are going to be prepared to turn over whatever they've discovered to the incoming mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| and let the council and the mayor go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| As the leaves have been tumbling down and accumulating in yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| I think citywide we need to do a little housekeeping about not putting our leaves in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| or in the gutter because this has become a problem in several neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| with the gutters being blocked from the raked leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| And so if we could remember to keep them on the edge of our lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Public service has been doing a super job of picking things up, but they can't be everywhere the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=800)|

| 0:13:29| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| A couple of issues that I just wanted to bring to light, especially in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| and several of my colleagues have gotten telephone calls on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| and I've asked Mr. King if he could maybe just address what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| There's a large shingle pile out on Lexington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| It's been building up higher and higher, and I've gotten several telephone calls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| They've been told to quit, but apparently I was out there today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| and three more dump trucks of asphalt shingles arrived on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| So I know Mr. King has some information that he can share with us about this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Councilman, we have been involved in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| that effort primarily led by Tom Reynolds in building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| The situation is there are zoning violations on the Lexington side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| and also the location on Borough, which is operated by the same contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| They have been issued a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| They've been issued citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| and we are currently evaluating our next steps in conjunction with our city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=874)|

| 0:17:57| but it appears from the agenda information that we are expanding the scope of this contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| and not simply raising the price, and I want him to tell us what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| because I think that's important for the citizens to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1087)|

| 0:18:22| In the course of time, we've uncovered two different old vitrified clay pipes that have failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1102)|
| 0:18:33| so we want to add those two locations to this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| and we also have a failed berm in a detention pond that we need to get a recommendation from the consultant on how to repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| So they're already on the job and you're going to have them do a few more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1128)|

| 0:19:32| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| The next three items on the agenda are items submitted by KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and I'd like to recognize Mark Walker from KUB who will speak to items 11D, E, F, and G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| and they're all related to some restructuring of funding for some projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Mark Walker, 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Mayor, members of City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight on KUB's proposed bond refundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| KUB has identified approximately $95 million in outstanding bonds across all four of its systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| which can be refinanced at lower interest rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| and result in a substantial cost savings to KUB and its customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| In particular, based upon current bond market rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| we are estimating total debt service savings of $9.2 million over the life of the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| and that's $7 million on a net present value basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| And how that breaks down by system is that's $3.2 million in savings for the electric system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| $2.3 million for the gas system, $1.1 million for wastewater, and $400,000 for the water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| And I'd just point out, if authorized by Council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| we do plan to go to market and sell the refunding bonds sometime during the first quarter of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| and the bonds would be sold through public competitive sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| with the bonds being awarded to the underwriters whose bids result in the lowest true interest cost to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| I also did want to point out that both KUB and the City have received a copy of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| from the Office of the State Comptroller on KUB's refunding plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| and I believe a copy of that report was provided to all the members of Council last week for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| In accordance with law and to comply with the requirements of the Comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| KUB does respectfully request that the Comptroller's report be reflected in the minutes of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| And that concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Yes, I appreciate you coming up and speaking on the front end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| One of the things that's interesting about this is that KUB has about, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| $690 million worth of outstanding bonds in these four areas, the electric, water, wastewater, gas, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1318)|
| 0:22:07| These new bond issues that you're talking about, the $95 or $97 million thereabouts, is going to retire some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, it will retire $95 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| It will not be used for other purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| To retire the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| So you're buying debt at a lower price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| And you said saving us $7 million net?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| $7 million net present value, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Well, I commend you guys for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| It's obviously that you're taking care of the rate payers and the system when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| One other thing, is it fair to say that none of these bonds, the four sets of bonds we're going to be talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| pledge the city tax dollars, but only the KUB system revenues or assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Any bond KUB issues, the revenues of the respective system are pledged to repay that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| The bondholders have no recourse against the taxation power of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I thought the taxpayers might want to hear that just so they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| I don't believe we have a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| We're going to start with one at a time, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| We'll entertain a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| On 11-D, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I think we have to have a voice vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=1409)|

| 0:33:54| This is a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2034)|

| 0:36:30| You know, 26 years ago there was a debate on who might be the next city council attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and so it came down to a few different attorneys, and finally one of the councilmen jumped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| His name was Kaz Walker, and he said, Let the young boy have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| No, I don't believe it was Kaz Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2208)|

| 0:41:32| all of whom who have been dedicated to providing unbelievable public service to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2492)|
| 0:41:41| And it's been a real thrill for me to be associated with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| And I wish I could name them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Also, I want to say a very special thank you to all of the mayors who I've had the honor to serve with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2508)|
| 0:41:57| and interact with and all of the city employees who were led by those mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| because it's always been fun to be associated with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| and to be able to know what's going on in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| and at the same time feel like you're somewhat a small part of what's going on in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| because so many good things have happened over the past quarter century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Finally, I wasn't going to get to the end of this, but I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Finally, I do not wish to become emotional, but if I were going to be emotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| I would be emotional about the staff of the city council who have been just the absolute best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| Whenever I have a question about what kind of legal advice to give my clients, I ask Cindy Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| and she always leads me correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| It's been a true pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| She, Cindy, and Susan, and Melissa are more like family than they are colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| and they have been for a long time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| The regret that I have about making this transition to the other side of the table is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| Cindy's going to have to give me advice by texting it to me now rather than by whispering it in my ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| and I like to have it whispered in my ear better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| So thanks again to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| This has been a wonderful thrill and a privilege for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| I'm not often surprised by city council, but I've been surprised tonight, and I'm very grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2616)|
| 0:43:50| Mr. Mayor, I might add that he's just moving down three chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| We're going to see him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| While we have a little break here, I'm looking at the Boy Scout troops who are out here in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| and if you'd like to come down and introduce yourselves, we'd like to recognize you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2649)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| I'm Bob Weissmuller, 304 Oak Park Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| I am with some fine young men that are taking citizenship in the community merit badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| and one of the requirements is to attend a meeting of a public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| And since the county commission and the school board meet during the day, you all drew the short straw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| So we are here tonight observing what's going on, and hopefully we'll also be able to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| and show them one of the courtrooms and explain the court system of Knoxville to them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Well, we're glad to have you, and I think we'll give you a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2691)|
| 0:45:03| Vice Mayor Bailey, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| There's another group of scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Oh, it's two different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| I'm Paul Honor, 4221 Valley View Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| We're Troop 213, and these young men are working towards their communications merit badge and life scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Let me recognize Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| We didn't have a chance to get a resolution on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| but so many people have been overlooked in the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| But I wanted to recognize Larry Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| who joined the city of Knoxville as the senior director of finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| and deputy to the mayor on September the 18th in 2006, and he's not with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| I think he retired last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| But Larry had really a decorated career in banking in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| and when he retired, he had a lot of options and he had different things that he could choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| But we're thankful that he came to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| About the time that he came to the city of Knoxville, we really dipped into a financial crisis across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2782)|
| 0:46:30| And he's provided steadfast leadership and thoughtful counsel to two mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| and he's just been a gentleman to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| He's always offered great courtesy and great advice, and he's just really distinguished himself here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| And I could go on and on, and, you know, I'd have a list of things to say about Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| but I just wanted to let him know how much we all appreciate him and his service here to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| Were you going to address that also, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| No, I was going to address the scouts for one second, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Well, let me say something about Larry Martin before you get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We wanted to have something for Larry Martin, but he insisted on not having anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| But we really wanted to have some type of ceremony or something in his honor before he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| But I want to say on behalf of myself, he was a great help to me during my time as the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| and the city will surely miss him and all of his contributions to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| So thank you for doing that, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| I wish he had agreed to have let us do something, but he insisted that we not do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| and that's part of his style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I'll second what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| He certainly has been an asset to the city in terms of strategic planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Scouts, I just wanted to say that it's a good thing that you're doing what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| and I think it's easy to over or underestimate, I guess, the effect you can have on your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| the community you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Every person that lives in a community has the chance to leave it a little better than they found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| And if you stick to your civic goals and your attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| you will make Knoxville a better place for yourself, your family, people that are around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| And so thank you for doing what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Apply yourself well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| 12A is an ordinance adopting the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Knox County Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan dated November 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| which amends the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Yes, I just wanted to say that this is the plan that we sent back to MPC at the meeting we last had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| And, Mr. Donaldson, I understand that you have presented this to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| and we are now free to vote on this, having been before your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| The Planning Commission reviewed and considered the plan at its December 8th meeting last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| and voted to transmit it back to you with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| But it is the plan, in fact, that we hammered out over those many weeks in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| with the County Commission in this very room with the help of the gentleman who was facilitating those meetings, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I'll move its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Mayor, I'm just going to say, while I won't be supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| I do respect all the hard work that went into it and those that support it, and I hope it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Councilman Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Yes, Mr. Mayor, it's been motioned and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| I would like to request this be heard on emergency reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Is that after we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Is that a motion, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| It needs to come in the form of a motion, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Motion to amend to add the emergency status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| And the effect of that, Mr. Mayor, is that it passed on this reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Councilman Attorney Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| If you pass it on emergency, then it will be effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Well, this has been before us many times, so I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| We need to vote on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| And now we need to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| As amended to the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Did you have something, Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Now that we're back to the original motion as amended, I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| I know we've spent a lot of time on this, but we are truly down to the wire with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| And I certainly want everyone who has supported this or not supported this to understand the implications of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| And I had a couple of questions two weeks ago for Mr. King and would like to follow up on those questions today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| so that I'm clear in how I vote on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| But I'd like to start with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And, Mr. Donaldson, one of the concerns that both the elected bodies, both county commission and city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| have had about this plan is a property owner's ability to understand the uses that they have by right with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3110)|
| 0:51:59| And my understanding with this plan is that if a property owner who has greater than 15% slope asks for a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| the recommendation of this plan, which, Mr. Swanson, becomes law, becomes part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Would be that a planned zone be recommended rather than a, quote, regular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| And a planned zone means then that that property needs to go through a review process by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| and then eventually those plans also go through review in the city engineering department to ensure compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I really have serious concerns about this plan because of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| One is the zoning and plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| I think it's important that when folks want to develop their property, when they're owners of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| particularly in the economic environment that we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| that they have some sense of certainty as to what they'll be allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| And if we have an individual who wants to sell their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| the buyer really has no assurance that they will be able to develop it in the manner in which they think might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| until the planned zone is put into place and that whole review process is going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| That leads me to my second question, and that's for Director King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Assuming that a property goes into a planned review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| and certain restrictions are put on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| then compliance has to be monitored by the engineering department in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Is that correct, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| What kinds of things do you anticipate that the city might be monitoring under this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| We think we will be expected to ensure that the clearing limits are as per the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3231)|
| 0:54:00| if that particular requirement is placed by MPC on the use-run review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| We anticipate that, you know, that could take potentially a couple of more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| And so you currently don't feel like you have the capacity and personnel to support the level of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| that would be required underneath this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Has your department sat down and made an estimate of what the personnel needs that you might have under this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| and what the cost to the city taxpayers might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| We think the minimal requirement would be two employees, one an engineering technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| and an urban forester as recommended by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| And that cost would be on the order of, with benefits, $100,000 to $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| The first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| And, of course, that compounds and escalates the longer folks are with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Is that under our current development environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Yes, that's our estimate for the current development environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| And, obviously, if things were better, there would be more to review and it could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| How many employees do you think we would need in a more robust development environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| We attempted to make an estimate of that based on the development that was going on in around 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| And we think that might go from maybe two employees to maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| And my understanding, Mr. Swanson, is that county commission, in their consideration of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| changed it in such a way that they would not be bound by this level of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| at least in terms of, Mr. Donaldson, the properties that are considered for change in zoning in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| would not necessarily have that recommendation that they go into a planned zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| which then initiates this plan's review for compliance through engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| There's a difference between possible and probable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| In the current and in the past history, the zone of choice for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| both in the city and in the county, has been planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| So that will continue, regardless of whether they pass a hillside plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| So developers choose the two-step zoning because it's the only way they can hit their markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3381)|
| 0:56:30| The current zoning ordinances are such that the markets have moved beyond them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| and planned residential zoning gives the developer the flexibility to do the type of product that they want to do on their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3395)|
| 0:56:45| But I hear you saying that the preponderance of rezoning has been planned development at the developer's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3405)|
| 0:56:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| And what we're talking about here is a situation where it will not be choice, at least under the city plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| Well, all the plan does is recommend that you use planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Now, if you can create findings where there are exceptions due to this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| you can create zoning that's consistent with the plan without using a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| But people choose to use the planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Mr. King, in terms of the planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I understand from what is actually written in this plan that Knox County does not have the means to carry this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3448)|
| 0:57:36| Is that your understanding of where the county is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| That's my understanding, but I haven't really reviewed in detail what the county adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| Page 48 of the plan says that the city's public service department personnel are responsible for timber clearing plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| and replanting plans where clearing is approved for site development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| The county has no similar review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| I think my third serious concern with this plan is what we have talked about all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| and that is that if the city adopts this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| we are setting ourselves up to have a more restrictive zoning environment than there exists in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| That certainly has been the case in incidental kinds of ways for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| but I think when there is less developable land in the city to set ourselves up in this way to be even more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3500)|
| 0:58:29| is a mistake for the city and for city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| I'm concerned about the cost of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I'm concerned about the inequity between the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| and I'm concerned about the capriciousness of plan zoning, property owners not knowing what their rights will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| And so for that reason, I'm sorry that I'm not able to support this plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Mr. Donaldson, how much property are we talking about in the city that would be affected by this plan as opposed to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| Well, certainly the majority of the property that's within the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| but there's a significant amount in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Much of it has already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Places like Colston Hills, where I live, is all primarily within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| Many subdivisions within the city are within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| There is raw land still available for development within the city that is within the boundary of the protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3566)|
| 0:59:37| Oh, Councilman De La Voca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Well, first I have to say that I'm kind of fascinated that Ms. Roddy sat through some of those meetings we had with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| and never expressed those views and now brings them up at the time we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| But that's her choice, and she represents constituents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| But I wanted to point out that Mr. King is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Mr. King, isn't it a fact that we just spent $5 million on Broadway to make extra flood zone space because of the kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| we've had in this community over the last decade, and we're trying to mitigate flooding from careless construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| that puts too much water into the system we have, the creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Isn't that fair to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| There are several reasons why urban streams flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| One is an increase in impervious area through development over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| The other is because, unfortunately, in our history, we have abused urban streams by building structures too close to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3632)|
| 1:00:42| When floodwaters rise and structures are too close, they flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| So we have had several million dollars of projects along creeks in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| where we have not only improved the channel to carry the flow of the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| but also purchased structures that were built years ago, decades ago, in locations where they should not have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| We've bought houses and torn them down so that we have additional floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| We've bought houses to create additional floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| We've bought houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| We've removed structures so they would not flood because it was cheaper in the long run for us to purchase the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| rather than to deal with a continuing flooding problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Right, and you are already in the process of enforcing stricter stormwater regulations than we have had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| because that is the trend with TDEC, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| You're going to have to have some personnel for enforcement in any event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| We are and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Yes, I just want to reflect too on a couple of points there Councilman Roddy made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3709)|
| 1:01:58| As far as, you know, us not being in the county is not in the same position financially as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| that we don't have near the, you know, the jails, engine care, the libraries, the school system, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| I mean, we ought to be proud that we're not, don't have those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| It's not a reflection on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| They do a good job with what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| But we're in a much different position financially, and I think we should celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| I don't think it's anything that we, that that's a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And, you know, I also don't think it's a detriment or a bad thing that if the city adopted codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| it was more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I mean, I don't care what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I've lived here all my life, and when I see dimster dumpsters floating down Broadway, there's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| I mean, there's something wrong somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| And, you know, it may be houses too close, this and that and other, but it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| it's telling me that we've got a bad problem and we need to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| And I think that this is a good start to get that, to get those problems addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| I mean, go out to Powell, to those poor people's homes where a mudslide came in on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| I mean, that stuff doesn't just happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| And to put a cost on it, I mean, I don't know how you can put a cost on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| And I don't take lightly that it may be $100,000 or it may be $500,000 if we have to hire five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| You know, one of the most, the second most profitable thing that the State of Tennessee enjoys is tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| And people come to East Tennessee for tourism because it's a beautiful part of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| And if it takes us $300,000 to $500,000 more in a budget, then we've got to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| You know, if we've got to cut back, then let's cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| But we cannot afford to give up our natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| And this is a chance for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| We've already made some mistakes along the way, but this is just a wonderful opportunity to take that first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| And I'm proud to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| And I don't think it's restrictive in any way as far as development goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| I think it's something that will preserve our community for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| And then we get to enjoy people like Scripps, Green Mountain Coffee, General Mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| I mean, this is the type of legislation that attracts these people for the long time, for people to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3851)|
| 1:04:20| So, you know, I just can't see that this, you know, those points just don't carry any weight with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| So I just want to move forward with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| I think we've got the votes to pass it, and I look forward to the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Well, I've taken a particular interest in this issue because the district I represent, the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| has seen at least its share of flooding, probably a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| And Mr. King's comment about the cost of earlier decisions that were made building close to Urban Springs is basically an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3887)|
| 1:05:00| It's on the agenda this very night in my district, 11C on Bank Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| where we actually purchased a house to demolish because it had been built too close to an urban spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| So although Councilperson Roddy's point is very well taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| and it's been reviewed during the process about how there was going to be probably a cost to enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3918)|
| 1:05:28| I think the cost, it's pretty well been demonstrated that the cost of doing nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| and non-enforcement is going to be exponentially higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| So although I do understand the necessity that we may need to add staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| and may need to spend some taxpayers' money to enforce this, I think in the long run it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| and maybe not even in the very long run, it's going to pay for itself many times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| So I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| I'd like to ditto just some of the things that Councilman Pavlis had to say and also Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| I really don't think that you can put a cost on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| And I think it's important that we as a city, you know, go ahead and continue to take the lead in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| and go ahead and protect what it is that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| And I do know that working in the development field and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| that there are ways in which, regardless of how restrictive codes may be or zoning may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| that there is ways in which you can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| And you can develop in a proper way, in a green way, in a way that's going to protect our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| And so I'm fully in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| I think that what we have is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| We have a plan that we can continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| If it needs to be worked in terms of amendments or things like this, I think we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| But I think there's been an awful lot of time and effort that's been put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| I think it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| And I'll definitely be supporting it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| A couple of weeks ago I went to see the movie The Descendants, probably because George Clooney was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| Despite that, there was an issue about property rights that prevailed in that movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| And there was a family who was a descendant of one of the Hawaiian princesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| and they owned a huge amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| And some of them were running low on cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| And so they were meeting as a family to decide to sell this beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| Well, of course, the scenery was spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| It was totally undeveloped and just everything we think about when we think of Hawaii.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| And so as not to spoil the end, they did come to a decision about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| But as I watched that movie, I got to thinking about the issue that we've dealt with with property rights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| And historically and legally, people have never had absolute ownership of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| The Native Americans never believed we could own the land completely and totally control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| So we are not Hawaii, but we are Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| And while we may have title to a piece of property, there's a larger force at work, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| So I will definitely be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| We have one person signed up to speak on this, on 12A, Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| If you would come down and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| And you have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4108)|
| 1:08:44| My name is Robert M. Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| I live at 11504 Mountain View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| I tell people I'm from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| I actually live in Farragut, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I'm the chairman of the Sierra Club for this area, of the 19 counties, including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| We have about, oh, a few hundred members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| I do, I'll diverge here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| I do wish that the scouts had stayed and listened to this debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| because this kind of debate that we've had just had is the heart and soul of the way the government runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| The Sierra Club is in total support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| and in support of the views that many of you all have spoken about concerning the good that this will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4167)|
| 1:09:37| I personally think it will do a lot of good, and I've told you that from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| So we would be pleased if you could see your way clear to adopt this plan tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4183)|
| 1:09:53| and lead the way for the rest of the county to eventually move to what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| It's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| I think it's sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| In the next ten years, you'll look back and you'll say, yes, that was a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| I walk on Third Creek Walking Trail occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| and there's a list of a bronze plaque down there on the east end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| One of the names on it is Ed Shouse, and that was put in there in 1973, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| And I don't remember whether that was controversial or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| A lot of people gave land to make that particular feature of the town an important recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| and walking feature, which is used by hundreds of people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| It's just the kind of thing that you do when you think ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| and think how the town is going to develop and how you'd like to see it develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| not for yourselves but for your children and grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Many of you have expressed a lot of good reasons for doing this, and I hope you support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| I'm going to diverge you again for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| and I just want to say that for the councilmen that are leaving this council and for you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| you will be remembered first as a group of a very small number of people since this country started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4278)|
| 1:11:26| who have served on governing bodies like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Bodies like this are the heart and soul of bringing to life the things that are in our Declaration of Independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4291)|
| 1:11:39| and our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| This is the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| It's kind of messy sometimes, but this is the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| And to you all who are retiring, since I've been there myself sitting about where Ms. Wrighty sits right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| it takes a lot of time to do this, which many ordinary citizens don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| But it does take time, regardless of which side you are on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| You are holding on an issue because you folks do your homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| and you have a sense of the issue when you come to the table to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| That's the only way you can govern, the only way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And for you, Mayor, I think that you've done a remarkable job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| and with grace and dignity governing this town as mayor during your period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| You won't be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| I think it's fair to say that everyone on this council wants to see healthy development move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| And if there is something in this plan that has an unintended consequence of impacting that unfairly, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4368)|
| 1:12:58| do we not have the ability to not only adopt a plan, but amend a plan if we have issues with it over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| So I think moving forward is a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| And if we find that in growing pains that there is something wrong, I think we need to get it on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| and get it fixed, but I urge us to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| and take the first step in protecting what is left of a sound, natural environment that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4397)|
| 1:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell, just for the sake of clarity, to state what we're voting on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| We approve Ordinance 12A as amended to an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| How many do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Then so the ayes have it, so are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| Yes, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| We don't have anyone signed up for a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213?start=4445)|
