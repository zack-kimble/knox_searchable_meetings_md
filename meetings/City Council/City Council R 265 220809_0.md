| 0:03:13| I want to start by wishing all of our students, staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| and faculty of Knox County Schools a welcome back to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=195)|

| 0:03:22| full day of classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Yesterday I was able to join teachers and staff at Green Magnet Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| to welcome the kids back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| They really went all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| They had a red carpet out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| They had a DJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| People were dancing and high-fiving the kids as they entered the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| and really put a smile on everybody's face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| So it was a really high energy and positive experience for the kids mostly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| and I enjoyed it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| So I'm just really grateful for all the people who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| keep our schools up and running and safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| and also to all the city people, you know, police, fire, public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| who make sure our kids and school staff are safe as they come and go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| school and while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| I also recently had the pleasure of touring the new Lonsdale Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| and I want to publicly thank all those who've been part of that land swap deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| that made this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| This was something the city had a direct role in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| and I know Councilmember Thomas has been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| and many other members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Councilmember McKenzie have been there to help craft the deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| and then help make sure it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| And so it was really great to see that new facility for the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| So really encouraged and think it's going to be a great year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Also yesterday, Councilmember Thomas and I had the pleasure to cut the ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| on one of five new playgrounds in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| We were out celebrating at the new Inskip Norwood Playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| that it includes 11 ADA play areas as well as a first-of-its-kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=291)|

| 0:04:59| and we both took our turns sliding down with the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| It was really fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| One of the best design features is that somehow they made it shady in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| so it wasn't even that hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| So thank you to everyone who helped make these playground improvements possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| And make sure you mark your calendars for another celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=317)|

| 0:07:10| Thank you, Council Member Parker, for serving on our board, and Mr. Lomax, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Really appreciate Charles' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| We're doing so many exciting things at Knoxville Community Media right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| and building a lot of momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| We've got a lot of fundraisers coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| This is just a small fundraiser that we're having this Saturday at Albright Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| It's a beer and cheese tasting, and I'd love to see some of you all there if you can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| But it's one of our small engagement events that we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| just to start getting out in the community more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Although government meetings are our top priority and are very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| I don't think a lot of the community knows what else we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| So we're just trying to inform the community of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| So I'll be back from time to time to tell you about all these other exciting events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and other exciting news that we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| But thank you all very much for what you do, and thanks for letting me announce this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| And sorry that I didn't put flyers in front of the folks who don't have nameplates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| You are just as important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Any other announcements from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Moving right along to Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Item 8A is a resolution confirming the mayor's reappointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| to the Knoxville Affordable Housing Fund Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| We have two members who have signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| First is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Mr. Givens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| You can start by saying your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| This agenda item is for the mayor's reappointment of two board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| who are high-level executives at their respective employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| The info in the agenda packet actually seems to be copied from their company websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| I'm sure they're fine people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| but there's not much to go on with the little blurbs that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| The city's boards are already overstuffed with real estate developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| and business folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| The staff of these agencies should certainly be experienced professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| but maybe the board should be people with diverse backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| and experience who understand the ground-level challenges facing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| who need affordable housing and not just the business challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| of profitable construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| To quote candidate Ken Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I believe that the best decisions come from the grassroots up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| and we need to empower people in all parts of the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| to help influence these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| City council members, what does this council do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| and what could it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Are you just the board that rubber stamps the mayor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| or are you representatives of the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I think it's past time that Knoxville reckons with its backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and anti-democratic city government structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Our at-large councilors got as many votes as our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and Charles Thomas actually got more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| but the power and the money are centered in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| The mayor even decides what you'll get the opportunity to vote on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| She decides how long you get to review the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| before the charter forces you to vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| which is pretty unbelievable in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| and she picks all of our city's board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| including this affordable housing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| as well as Park and KCDC and CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Well, our police department is facing multiple lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| for brutality and wrongful death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Our public housing has wait lists of up to four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| while entire camps pop up and are demolished under our bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Rents have gone up 60% since the mayor's inauguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| and working-class people cannot afford to keep living in their apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| CAT even started canceling bus routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| making some folks' commutes even more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I'm not quite sure the mayor is doing a great job with these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Councilmember Parker recently brought forward a very modest proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| to increase the power of the city council, and you all shied away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Perhaps the timing could have been better or the language more refined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| but to me the real issue is that you are afraid to use the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| that you have been given by the people of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| We are begging you to stand up to this mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| that is overrun with the influence of the wealthiest in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Please stop letting the mayor sell out our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Stand up for the people you're supposed to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Our city government is working as intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| It was designed to have one easily influenced, powerful person at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| and it turns out that whether that person runs as a conservative or as a progressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| as Mayor Kincannon did, that they are too easily controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| by the established wealth and power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Councilmembers, the people of Knoxville chose you to represent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| because you promised that you cared about the issues that affected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Mayor Kincannon might tell you not to let perfection be the enemy of the greater good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| but I would advise you to consider the opportunity costs of baseball stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| and grants and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Just a reminder, Mr. Givens, you're speaking to Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| This appointment lasts for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you. Please don't interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| The information in the agenda packet tonight is woefully inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| to make an informed decision on this confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Perhaps the council should demand that the mayor respect their roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| as representatives of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| You are all certainly more connected to the community than she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| In a moment, Tina is going to read a letter that is directly related to this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| because it's about how you treat affordable housing and the homeless, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| I hope that you will respect her while she reads. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| The next person to sign up to speak is Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Before I step away, I would like to say I have a copy of the letter as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| with over 250 signatures of Knoxville citizens who think that it should be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Ms. Sparks, please come to the podium. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Please start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=799)|
| 0:13:31| My name is Tina Sparks. I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=811)|
| 0:13:40| I have a master's degree in urban and regional planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| One of the things we learned when I was studying that is what a nightmare urban renewal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| The reason it happened is the arrogance of urban power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| When I'm hopefully elected mayor, I want to listen to the people of Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| to the people in the neighborhoods, and not just listen, give people a seat at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| and the decision-making authority to help influence our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| I believe that the best decisions come from the grassroots up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| and that we need to empower people in all parts of town to help influence these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| That was Mayor Ken Cannon's, those are her words, July 1st, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| when she was campaigning for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| That was from the Park Ridge Mayor Candidate Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| I'm going to read a letter from over 250 citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=875)|
| 0:14:51| To the Tennessee Valley Universalist Unitarian Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| whereas Mayor India Ken Cannon has committed cruel and violent acts against the houseless community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| including destruction of homes, destructions of personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| and jailing persons existing while homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| whereas Mayor India Ken Cannon repeatedly references her membership at TVUUC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| including referring to sermons during city council meetings to admonish certain council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| and uses her membership as an indicator of her moral standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| and whereas the Unitarian Universalist Association proclaims the congregations affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| and promotes seven principles and holds those principles as strong values and moral guides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Now, therefore, we request the Tennessee Valley Universalist Unitarian Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| to counsel your congregation member, India Ken Cannon, to follow those principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Principle one, the inherent worth and dignity of every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| by sending workers, city workers, to repeatedly destroy the possessions of the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| and displace them from their shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Mayor Ken Cannon refuses to treat the homeless as her equal neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Principle two, justice, equity, and compassion in human relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in Martin v. Boise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| that displacing city campers is a violation of the Eighth Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Principle three, acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| The only non-religiously discriminatory shelter in Knoxville is the foyer, and it is always full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| Principle four, a free and responsible search for truth and meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| Mayor Ken Cannon continues to claim that shelters that aren't full indicate adequate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| yet we have massive camps of folks banned from or have grievances against these local shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Her administration uses a deceptive definition of low-income housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| that allows the market rate rentals to qualify for city subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| Principle six, the goal of the world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| Mayor Ken Cannon's campaign against the homeless is a war waged by city-owned heavy equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| and armed police who threaten and intimidate our houseless neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| Principle seven, respect for the independent web of all existence that we are a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| The environmental devastation of this war against the homeless flows into our creeks and spreads across our lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| Homeless camps are frequently surrounded by overflowing trash bins and dumpsters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| This choice made by our mayor is not to protect the delicate ecosystem of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1057)|
| 0:17:47| Principle five, the right of conscience and the use of democratic process within our congregations and in society at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| We urge the congregation to take advantage of all parts of the democratic process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and we believe that you as fellow congregation members can reach Mayor Ken Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| with these pleas for justice and equity in a way that the homeless community and their advocates have not been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| We request that both congregation members and leadership speak personally with Mayor Ken Cannon about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| We encourage your leadership to include lessons directly about serving the poor and the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| Serving the poor and the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Sincerely, 230 plus citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Your time is up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| I want to provide a little context and then I'll call on council members who want to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| First of all, I'm really proud and grateful for my administration's efforts on affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| including the creation of the Affordable Housing Fund and the Affordable Housing Fund Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| So that was done in partnership with members of this council and huge numbers of people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| including members of Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| So as you know, this is a 10-year, $50 million commitment to address the increase in housing costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| in order to create safe, quality, long-term housing opportunities in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| And we have made great strides in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| There's obviously still work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The market has changed and costs are going up in all parts of our real estate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| And there's still work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| So I'm confident, however, that we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| So a couple accomplishments I want to share with you as we review these reappointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| The last two budgets, we have made more than $17.5 million in investments through this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| including First Creek at Austin and the Transforming Western Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| And we've added nearly 1,000 affordable housing units that are complete or underway as a result of work of the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| And an additional 385 units are in the works right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| There's also about to be an opening of additional permanent supportive housing for our unhoused neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| who need permanent supportive housing, and that's in partnership with Volunteer Ministry Center over at Caswell Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| So I'm really proud of our work that we've done in partnership and appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| I also want to personally thank the committee members who volunteered their time and dedication for this critical work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| including Jocelyn Hunley, C. Danny Johnson, Ben Bentley, Houston Smelter, Missy Goodwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| and tonight's nominees for reappointment, Craig Cobb and Jeanette Kelleher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| So just wanted to share those accomplishments with you and then turn it back to you all for your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you, Councilmember Parker and Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you, Mayor. I expressed these concerns when the committee was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| that there was no one with lived experience on this advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| that those being appointed were individuals that the city had easy access to for their council on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1264)|
| 0:21:16| But what the city lacks and what feedback from the community and, you know, each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| periodically we have a review of our housing and development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| And the last report that I read, you know, really criticized the city for not implementing new initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1293)|
| 0:21:43| And that has been my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We have been choosing or investing money in a small, select few strategies to address our affordable housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1305)|
| 0:22:03| And we're not doing enough. We're not doing near enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| When, you know, just had a trip to Denver where I was able to learn from colleagues all around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1326)|
| 0:22:15| including here in the state, and had a chance to speak with colleagues serving on National Metro Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1335)|
| 0:22:26| And we just had a presentation given to City Council from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1346)|
| 0:22:36| We talked about how housing is now becoming more affordable in Nashville than Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1356)|
| 0:22:45| Well, in talking to councilmembers, Nashville is investing $30 to $40 million per year into affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| They're not budgeting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I would like to know of that $17.5 million we budgeted, how much has actually been spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| Because I know $1.5 million, at least, that's been budgeted each year for permanent supportive housing has yet to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1383)|
| 0:23:14| The Caswell Manor Project was finalized under the previous administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| So we need new projects moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| I mean, we've got to produce, build affordable housing and other housing solutions at a much greater rate than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1406)|
| 0:23:37| And I believe in order to do that, we've got to have the right people at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| We need the folks who are spending their time looking for solutions because they themselves need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1422)|
| 0:23:52| Others in the community, they don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| It's not in their mind a problem like we hear from too many leaders in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| That is everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| And when I hear that, when I hear this isn't just a problem specific to Knoxville, but this is an affordable housing shortage that everyone is experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| What that tells me is that that person has no commitment to truly trying to solve this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1454)|
| 0:24:24| They have given up and decided this is something everyone else is facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| But when you look at the statistics for a city like Knoxville, we are at the top of the list in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| And we shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| We shouldn't be outpacing other cities for the increase of our housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| We can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| And we need more people at the table to bring in these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| The other thing I wanted to raise is that when we passed this ordinance, we were promised a report on the performance of this trust fund and advisory committee after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1491)|
| 0:25:04| But I haven't seen a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Is there a report coming forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Yes, I have a draft copy and should be able to share the final copy with council later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| So, you know, I think this is important work that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| I would like to see us invest at a higher level, make this a higher priority than honestly the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1521)|
| 0:25:31| Honestly, if this baseball stadium hadn't sucked up so much energy from this city, we could accomplish so much more in terms of supporting and helping and implementing projects that could actually serve the low-income community members in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1531)|
| 0:25:48| But what I've seen is so much energy by this city being invested in this baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1548)|
| 0:25:57| We've got to shift our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| We should get that report and have a meaningful conversation before being asked to vote on the future makeup of this advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1560)|
| 0:26:13| That's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I would urge my colleagues to vote for these reappointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| When this fund was set up, the initial people that were appointed we all voted on, and they were given staggered terms, a one-year term, a two-year term, and a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1582)|
| 0:26:34| The two people that are before you tonight have served on the committee for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Their one-year term is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| That is why I assume the mayor is asking for them to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| I respectfully disagree that the people on this committee are not as concerned about affordable housing as some might think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1605)|
| 0:26:54| Many of them have given their life's work to dealing with these issues, and the problem is not going to be solved by any one group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1614)|
| 0:27:07| There are representatives from different walks of life, but we have to get the people who develop property to understand the need and help them come up with solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1627)|
| 0:27:19| because we don't have enough tax dollars in the world to do it all ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| So I would respectfully ask you to reappoint these fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Councilmember Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1660)|

| 0:28:28| lying approximately 660 feet east of the intersection with Maloney Road and Dresser Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| having tax identification numbers as 135GA005, 135GA00501, and 135GA006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1714)|

| 0:28:51| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Yes, I have some concerns about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| It seems like for an annexation, state law requires the city to develop a plan of service for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1741)|
| 0:29:15| And under this plan of service, the Knoxville Fire Department, as reasonable as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| have just listed out all the wonderful services that they have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| The Knoxville Police Department, sadly, has promised to shift existing police beats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1769)|
| 0:29:42| personnel, and equipment to the needed coverage area, creating Beat 71,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1782)|
| 0:29:52| and hire additional police officers to provide more response to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1792)|
| 0:30:02| It also promises to respond to traffic accidents in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| which we know is a service that KPD has reduced for other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1810)|
| 0:30:20| So I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| KPD also does not list their overall response time, as the Fire Department does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1823)|
| 0:30:32| because I'm, you know, it's probably not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| And so if we're talking about, you know, this is not an appropriate manner for expanding the size of the police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1836)|
| 0:30:47| but through an annexation where we've committed, through a plan of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| to expand our police department so that we can better serve an additional four acres being added to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| We have other development projects that are non-acres of land undergoing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| where there was no activity there prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| Other parts of the land that are being redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| And yet, that new activity, that new development, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1878)|
| 0:31:27| hundreds of new residents being added to an area doesn't come with an increase of our police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| but this annexation of four acres is proposed to increase the police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| Can you help me understand, through this plan of service, what the city is obligating itself to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| Yes, I can help you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| We're already in the process of trying to recruit more people to the police department, so nothing's changed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| And this new voluntary annexation would get the same level of service as other parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| including for traffic accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| So that's the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| I believe this is a question for an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| I don't know which one of you wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Maybe you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| My understanding is the total number of the authorized force of the police department does not change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| unless this body authorizes an increase in authorized force strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So right now we're authorized for 400 and something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| so annexing property does not mean a change in the overall size of the force unless we, as a body, increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| We don't currently have that force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| We need that force to meet all of the city's needs, including the additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| But you cannot do an annexation and increase the size of the force unless this body authorizes an increase in the size of the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Okay, so back to my question, wanting to clarify, what are we committing to in this plan of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| In the eyes of state law, if we commit to expanding our—I can't remember the language, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=1995)|
| 0:33:26| What we're committing to is the fact that we are currently understaffed with regard to our authorized police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| We're committing to continue our efforts to increase our efforts up to our authorized maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| so that we can provide appropriate service to all sections of the city, including the annexed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| Okay, that's what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Okay, and then the other piece of it is the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2027)|
| 0:33:58| When I look at the reason for the annexation, it seems like the benefit is to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2038)|
| 0:34:10| I'm not seeing a benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| From the developer's point of view, it relieves some headache to not have property in both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2053)|
| 0:34:24| But as things are currently, that property is receiving county services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| which there's an overlap in some of the services that are listed in the city's plans for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2071)|
| 0:34:43| In terms of access to KUB, KUB also offers services in the county in terms of parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2083)|
| 0:34:54| County residents obviously have access to city parks if they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| There's language in here about residents having access to federal funding coming into the city for housing assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2102)|
| 0:35:12| Well, the county has the bulk of the funding for housing assistance, so they would benefit from those county programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2112)|
| 0:35:25| So I just don't see an overall benefit to the city from this annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2125)|
| 0:35:34| But more added stress to services like public service, like police, that doesn't seem to benefit us at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2134)|
| 0:35:48| Ms. Parker, I'm going to ask Rick Emmett, who's had a long time experience with annexations for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| and while he's walking up here to give you some context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I would just say that we do have the benefit of economies of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| and so all our services, to expand just a little bit, is not that big a deal because we have economies of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| And also every time someone chooses to be annexed into the city, we get the benefit of their property tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| And right now, as you said, people can use our city parks and our city streets and our city infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| whether they're city tax property payers or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| So this is an additional thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I'll ask Rick Emmett to expand upon that and explain any other elements you think can help council understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you. Yeah, I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I'm the downtown coordinator and also, I guess, the annexation guy for the city for the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| We've done many, many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| We're already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| The city limit is already right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So we're already providing services to that area pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Certainly an apartment complex may have some extra services required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| but generally, like the mayor said, we get property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| We get a census count, which will be a big deal in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Every year, the state gives us state-shared funding based on census, so that helps us in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| Frankly, for new development like this, there's not that much of a service request we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| It's brand-new construction, so we're not probably going to get flooding calls or anything like that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| So it's usually very helpful for us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Most of the time, it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Most of the time, people don't want to be in the city because they don't want to pay double taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| But they come in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And again, this one is better for our inspection department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| You know, whenever a building is built like that, who's going to inspect the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Frankly, we also show up on the city limit, on the city boundary every time there's an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| If there's a fire, for instance, and it was not in the city, the city fire department is still going to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| because it's right on the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| They get dispatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| And same with city police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| We go out on the borders of the city all the time just outside the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| because we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| We're concerned about our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| So that's why these kinds of things are pretty important to us, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| You know, state law requires the property owner to request the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| And we don't get very many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| We get a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| And we try to scrutinize these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| The mayor and her staff look over these pretty carefully, and we don't always do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| But one like this, we did feel like it was an important one that could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| And the property owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| The developer is here as well in case there's some questions of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And is it possible for the developer to do the opposite of annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| and move the city portion to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| We have never de-annexed any property, and there's very few cities in the state that have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| It's a slippery slope once you start de-annexing property like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| So we have not done that as a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| And the developer cannot make that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Mr. Emmett, looking through the packet, it looks like there's a letter from the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| that's indicating that they'd like to be annexed because they're planning a multifamily project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| And then just looking through the sections we've been discussing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| where we're talking about services to be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| my review of those makes me think that what we're doing is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| someone's asking to come into the city, and we're saying to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| these are the services we provide all citizens in all neighborhoods all across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| and you will be welcomed to the city with the same services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| And state law requires that we prepare a plan of service that says this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| So this is what we've done for the last probably 40 or 50 years in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| probably for 20-some years, that we actually prepare this plan of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Each department prepares their own plan of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| I don't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| I just accept it, although I've read all of them over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| and I generally know if it looks reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| So, yes, that's the way we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| And we'll have a public hearing on the plan of service itself here in a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| That's state law as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I mean, there's three readings of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I mean, it's a pretty important step in the way the state of Tennessee regards annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| So it's pretty involved, lots of public process to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Oh, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Mr. Emmett, how often do we get requests for people to be annexed into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Well, I have an annexation request already for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| We try to do them once a year because it is so involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| It takes months and months and months of work for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| So we try to have them, you know, spring or fall like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And I've already got one for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| It's a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| It's not an apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| It's just a set of residents that are just outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| They want leaf and brush pickup and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| And they're elderly, and they like our services, and their neighbors are getting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and they want them from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Would it be fair to say there's less than five that we annex in the city every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Yes, usually more like one or two at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Okay, so it's very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Yes, the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Can I ask a couple questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Sean Chalmers, 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| The plan for this is multifamily, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| How many units do you think would be involved in this piece of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| What do you think the property taxes, give me a ballpark of that, might be for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| I don't have that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| I mean, our project basically was multiple parcels that we purchased initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Half of it was in the city, half of it was in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Honestly, if we had a choice, we would have de-annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| It was for simplicity of public services as opposed to having the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| trying to figure out how to respond from a fire or police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| We opted to make it simpler and annex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| We'll be paying more taxes, obviously, to pay city and county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| We're doing it to try to simplify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| I'm going to go one more step further on just ballpark property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Not holding you to it, but just more than how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| All in, probably in the $700,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| We've talked a lot about affordable housing tonight and the shortage that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| and the property taxes that we'll gain from this annexation will help fund affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| All housing will be good, I think, for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| I just wanted to clarify some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Mr. Chalmers, I'll just say on behalf of the city, we're going to make it worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| With our great public services and public safety, your residents will be proud to be part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Knoxville's Community Development Corporation to provide administrative services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and operational support to the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| and the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville for the downtown cinema,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| including supporting the city's redevelopment priorities for an amount not to exceed $100,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Council members, just want to clarify, this is a service that the Development Corporation has been providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| and now it's going to be provided by KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| There's no change in the amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| It's just a change in who's in charge because the Development Corporation is being dissolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Or not being dissolved, but that function of it is no longer going to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| I'm trying to have a better understanding of the funds that the TDC managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2627)|
| 0:44:00| And it says that the money that the TDC previously managed was allocated in accordance with an agreement between the city and KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2640)|
| 0:44:14| But the agreement was not included in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| So I'm needing more information about the details of that agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| and a better understanding of why this can't be a self-funded project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2665)|
| 0:44:36| where the funding for TDC is used to pay the administrative fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| I'm going to ask Ben Bentley, head of KCDC, to come share some more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| That's a really important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| So there is an existing management agreement that was assumed by KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| that was originally between the Development Corp and the city IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| It's in the amount of roughly $45,000 a year for administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| So this is like day-to-day finances, bookkeeping, all of that of the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| What we're adding onto this, and I think it's a really important sort of critical move by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| to do a thorough kicking and vetting of these projects as they come in, new development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| We're acting as sort of, you all are all familiar with the third-party financial review that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| But before that, there's a whole lot of legwork that goes into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| looking at the numbers, the assumptions for construction costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| for revenue expectations, all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| and making sure that they're reasonable not just in the global context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| but also in the market that we exist in in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| All of that scope is sort of being added to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| in addition to the $45,000 management fee that was previously in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| I might not have answered your question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Well, how about the funds that were previously managed by TDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| So in terms of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| How much is there, and why can't we pull from that for this additional work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Ms. Parker, I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| The development corporations primarily, most of their funds are from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| and it's to manage business parks that are outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| I think it's like 75% of their whole budget, or maybe more, is from outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| That's why I'm the only city representative on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Everyone else is the county mayor and other county appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So the city's financial contributions have been for this management of our IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| And so that's why that function is going to go to KCDC now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| because the development corporation is just shrinking to just the state-mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| economic development planning portion of it, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Is that right, Stephanie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| And so from the smaller portion that represents the city's portion of TDC funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| we're not able to use that for this new additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| There is no new additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| It's just the money and the administrative role is going from TDC to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| And just to build on that, previously the—tell me if I'm wrong, Stephanie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| but I think the $100,000 was being allocated to TDC in prior year budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| So this is approval of this last fiscal year, which is the first year that it's come to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2850)|

| 0:48:53| Mr. Evans, could you give a little overview of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| CFO for the city, Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Essentially we've had this bond is coming, this loan is coming due in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2944)|
| 0:49:13| so we would have to either pay up or refinance it, refund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| as it's called for local governments in some manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| So we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| The other thing is the index, just like last meeting, you voted on the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| some of their investment policies changing because the LIBOR index was going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Well, it's the same thing with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| The LIBOR index is going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| so we're going to what the majority of local governments use or are starting to use now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| which is the SOFOR index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| And we're going for a variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| We've really got only, if you carried it to full maturity, ten more years on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| Variable rate debt, you know, the best way to get that is in shorter pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| So we're going for five years of variable rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| but we fully expect to carry that out to another ten years when that five years come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3013)|
| 0:50:23| ten years aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| And there's some money to be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| We're going to save $1.6 million over five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| and $2.1 million over the next ten years if we carry it to its full maturity date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| just when you compare it to the current loan structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| So in short, we've got to do something with that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| We're refunding it, and we're going to save some money, and we're going to change index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| If I'm not mistaken, at some point we were on track to pay off this debt early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| We may pay off it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| We're still not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| That depends on how our revenues do in terms of, like, tourism development zone dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| our hotel-motel dollars and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| It will depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| We might be able to pay it off a couple years early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We're just not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| We kind of look at that year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| I will say, in fact, I think I mentioned it, we're down right now to $75.6 million left in debt on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3090)|
| 0:51:39| and we started off at almost $162 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| So we've, like I say, $75.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| This is $60 million of that, and then we've got $15 million, a little over, and some more bonds that we're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3108)|
| 0:51:59| We're paying these down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I think I looked it up today, and we pay every year in the neighborhood of 5.9 million, roughly 6 million a year on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3120)|
| 0:52:16| So it's going down, and we may be able to pay it off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| It's just that changes from year to year, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Do you know if we're paying above the state share of the tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3144)|
| 0:52:35| I'm sorry. I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Do you know what funds we use to pay towards this debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| We use TDZ dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| We use hotel, motel dollars, and we also receive Knox County's annual contribution of 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3165)|
| 0:52:54| And that will continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| You know, my only concerns are that my anticipation was that we were on track to pay this debt off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3179)|
| 0:53:09| I believe 2027 was a date loaded at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| And when I see—well, help me understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| There's a provision in here for a redemption schedule, and there are, it seems, penalties for early payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3200)|
| 0:53:30| Are there penalties if we pay this off early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| We do not in any way plan to pay it off any earlier than five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| But I would ask Mr. Joe Ayers with Cumberland Securities to talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Ayers, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Joe Ayers, Cumberland Securities, 918 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| As Mr. Evans was talking about, this was part of three series of bonds that were issued for the convention center about 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3238)|
| 0:54:07| All three of those issues were put together to have a final maturity date of 30 years, which would be 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3247)|
| 0:54:15| So this particular resolution authorizes entering into a new loan with JPMorgan Chase for a five-year term, which would take you to 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3255)|
| 0:54:26| At that point in time, as Mr. Evans was mentioning, you have the opportunity with no prepayment penalty to pay the entire loan off at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| or renegotiate it to extend it for five more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| We're going to have to do a roll call for this issuing of general obligation refunding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| So, Mr. Johnson, please do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Vice Mayor Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3301)|

| 0:56:19| Councilmember Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| We don't get very many of these, Mayor, so I'd like the applicant, Mr. Cockerell, if you could come up and give us an overview of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| And I would appreciate knowing intimately where you started and where you landed, if you could help explain your original plan versus where you've landed for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3388)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| My name is David Cockerell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I reside at 2015 Oakwood, Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And can you use the term intimately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| You really want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| I was intimately involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| You want just a little bit of the whole history of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| No, just describe the development, the plan development concept that you're asking for approval of today and maybe the original plan and the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3421)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Well, the current plan per our application will result in 77 units for workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| 36 of the units will be in two new buildings consisting of two- and three-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| The existing historic Giffin School will have 41 units, mostly efficiencies and studios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3447)|
| 0:57:37| These facilities are really family units based on workforce development formula, based on income as a percentage of the median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3457)|
| 0:57:52| and then there is a percentage of their total income that they can pay as rent in these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| So it's limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Mr. Smith, did you have any other things you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I just want to add this is a planned development, so it will come back before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| but I just want to give a shout-out in two ways to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| This is a significant change from your original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and I think it's a direct result of the contributions of the South Haven neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| the hours that they spent giving you feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| And I want to give you credit for this is the most changes I've ever seen a developer make in response to a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| and so I want to give both the neighborhood credit and you credit for listening because there were significant concerns earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| I think you did a great job of balancing those concerns with doing something good for the neighborhood that fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| So I want to commend you for that, and I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| It's been an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| It's been fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| I feel like we've made some friends along the way, and we listened, and we still have a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| It's much less dense than what we originally started out with, but I'm an architect and planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| I'm not a true developer, but I'm happy with it as an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| and a planner to see what's going to happen with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| It's a beautiful property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Mr. Cockrell, thank you for bringing this to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| and Councilmember Smith, thank you for your efforts helping interact with the community and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| I know that school's been vacant for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| so converting it to housing, which we so desperately need, is really good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| so I'm looking forward to seeing the plans as they unfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3586)|

| 0:59:51| Yes, just very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| I've watched this school and this property go through several configurations over many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| and I'm really glad to see that it's being preserved and used in the manner that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| So best of luck to you and your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| And I want to give credit to the Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| especially under the leadership of Gail Atherton, who is sitting right over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Just a steady hand throughout the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| She held her ground when she needed to, and she yielded when she needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| So when I talk about making friends, she's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Thank you, Mr. Cockrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3630)|

| 1:01:33| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Yeah, I just want to check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| I believe Ms. Moffin, I don't know if anybody else from the commission is here to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| So I don't know that we need lengthy conversation, but I appreciate all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| I know we've discussed this previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| There was a request brought to council via public forum from the RECR companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| You guys discussed it at the RECR commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| And so it's my understanding, and you can verify it, that I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| We have two agenda items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| If we vote to approve the agenda item before us right now that has a motion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| then we will withdraw the second agenda item that's after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Sorry, I can't figure out the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And I do want to let you know that there are representatives from the RECR companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| and their council available if you have questions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| There was a mix-up, I think, in the understanding that this would need two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| So I think members from the RECR commission will be here at the next reading if there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I mean, there will be two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| This will be passed on first reading, and it will come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| If it's passed on first reading, there will be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Yeah, that's how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| So, Ms. Maupin, you guys had discussion at the RECR commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| and we all have packets here where you've researched all the rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| the other cities around the southern region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| And so basically what we're voting on here is to give the RECR commission the power to set the rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| instead of having to come to council to edit the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| As it stands currently, there isn't a clear path for the RECR companies to request a rate increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| and so this would give clear direction to the RECR commission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| I'm supporting this and made one of the parts of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| because I think this is the appropriate way not to codify those rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I guess I'm a little troubled by this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Here, council is giving up our authority to deal with these rate increases to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| which I think is a great group of folks who are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| From the packet, we see that the last time the rates were set was in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| and we heard recently from the folks from the RECR community that they needed to have an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| which I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| We've got another agenda item coming up where we can set the rates based on the advice of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| and I would think that's a better approach than for council to give up our review of these going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3853)|
| 1:04:22| This hasn't happened very often, so I don't think it's going to take up a bunch of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| I do agree that the business community has changed in a lot of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| and I'm sure it's changed with the RECR community as well because we heard from them earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| but I don't think this is an appropriate thing, so I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Just my one thought is that we didn't get the information until late in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| I know that we've talked about it some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| but I'm also concerned that we don't have all stakeholders here tonight to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| I don't know if it would be amenable to this body to postpone for two weeks in order for everyone to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| and allow us more time to review the information that was distributed this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Council Member McKenzie and then Parker, and then back to Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| I'm inclined, Mayor, to agree with Council Member Testerman because there are a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and if we don't have all stakeholders here that can properly address these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| it may be a little bit difficult to make a more informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| I was just going to say I will formally make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Okay, motion made to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| It's been made. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Okay. We're discussing the motion to postpone right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Yes, I would support the motion to postpone at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| We did get some of the information a little bit late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| and so I think it may help for us to all have a little bit more time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Any other questions or comment on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I have no concerns about postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| I'd like to hear from Savannah if there are any concerns from the Record Commission about postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| and whether we should, if we do postpone this item, go ahead and set rates for the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| and then take up this matter for future decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I just wanted to mention that when this item came before the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=3997)|
| 1:06:45| not, I guess it was officially on our agenda, correct, this record issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| It reminded myself of Knoxville Transportation Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| and how the Transportation Authority set the rates for taxi cabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| and went through that process with the Transportation Authority last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| And it was a group of people who were focused on transportation issues in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| who could take the time to study it and really give, having an informed vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| So that's one reason why I was supportive of this responsibility moving over to the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4044)|
| 1:07:33| Also understanding that we have the alternate authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| and so if we do not feel like they are carrying their duties out appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| we can always pass an ordinance to bring that back under city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| But I'd love to hear from Savannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Ms. Maupin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| And just, I know council members all know who you are, but just for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| if you could just share with the public your role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Savannah Kirk, internal auditor, and I'm also council's liaison on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| I don't think the commission necessarily has any reservations about the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| but I do know that the Record Companies did start reaching out to the city in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| and due to the confusion about who to come to and how to get those requests to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| it took them until March for the Record Commission to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| and then, of course, now it's August before you're seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| So they have been waiting, and I know that they would like a decision made soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| Now the suggestion that it's definitely a strategy to postpone this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| and then discuss 12C about actually setting rates, which would not cause a delay for the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| So that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Thank you, Ms. Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I didn't say your name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Yeah, I'm not going to argue against a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| I'll support and vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| That's fine, because I know there are some members of the Record Commission that could not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| I think, as Ms. Maupin said, one of the issues is the clear path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Ms. Kirk, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Oh, old last name, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Apparently it's in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| She wanted me to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Anyway, there wasn't a path for the records to be able to request a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| But I have a question here that maybe someone else can answer from finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| What other fees, and it may not be finance to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| what other fees are codified that council gets to vote on to change in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| Like beer permits, do we set the fees for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| Is it in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I mean, there's a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| There are a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| And they're in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| There are a lot of them, and they're in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| And you set them from time to time as the need permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| But we haven't done a full survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| And if you would like a full survey, you can ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I would like a full survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| If you would do that in advance, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I would like a full survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I would like to ask Ms. Kirk to help with that prior to the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Maybe if we can have that in the next week, I think that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| I think having to vote on all the singular fees set is cumbersome, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| I'm not sure that it gives us particular powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| I think there's some fees set in the building department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| There's fees charged for planning applications, but we don't set those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| I think we give the authority to departments and people who are knowledgeable to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| And maybe controlling the actual dollar figure is not what we need to actually control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| But those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Those are the thoughts I feel like we discussed at audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| And so that was the line of thinking at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| That requires repetitive coming and discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| When you talk about salaries and all those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| there's automatic triggers in the code for those to go up and have some COLA that affect them every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| some automatic inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| And when you set fees like this and you don't review and change them every ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4285)|

| 1:18:13| I was hoping to get a little more information about this zoning mixed use regional center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| It's the first time I'm seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| And as described, it suggests it would allow the area to move forward with development similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4703)|
| 1:18:32| to the waterfront development in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| But that was under a planned development and, you know, overlay and lots going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| So I'm just curious to learn more about this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Director Brooks, could you speak to Councilmember Parker's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4730)|

| 1:21:23| Yeah, I'd just like to call on Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| I believe he's here from the pantries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| There was one concern that was brought up in the packet from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| So I called Mr. Wright today and so just wanted to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| I had a question and the neighbor across the street had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| So could you tell everybody what you guys are going to be doing on this empty parcel of land down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| Okay, we're known as Fish Hospitality Pantries in Knoxville and we provide food relief to about 7,000 families each month in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| During the pandemic, the great number of increased numbers of people coming to us has required that we have purchased additional food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4915)|
| 1:22:04| And we are donations have increased so that we could double the amount of food we've been giving people, including the increase we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4924)|
| 1:22:13| So we've needed additional storage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| The last year and a half, we've been renting space off-site to store 50 to 70 pallets of food, canned foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4936)|
| 1:22:25| We are acquiring this property at one block from our Scott Avenue Pantry Warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| We just run out of space and it will not be a service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| It will be strictly storage for additional food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| Very little activity will go on there during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| How far away is the current warehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| It's one block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| The one that you've been using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| The one that we currently have and need additional space for is one block away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Or the rental space is on Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Oh, okay, so you're having quite a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Yeah, this allows us just to go one block away to bring food in and out that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| Okay, thank you. I appreciate it, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I've had the chance to come down and volunteer just a hot minute, but there's a lot of neighbors in the community that come down and volunteer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4982)|
| 1:23:11| The concern was that there was going to be an expansion of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| and then when I looked at the zoning code, it was like, well, it doesn't allow services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| So we clarified he wasn't going to provide services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| Right, our intention is only for storage for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Okay, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Ms. Parker and then Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| Just quickly, and thank you for asking that question so we could get a better understanding of the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5017)|
| 1:23:45| It seems like for the use proposed, the industrial mixed-use zoning would go far above and beyond what you need for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5025)|
| 1:24:02| Is there not another more appropriate zoning change that could accommodate the need for those storage uses but not open the property up to other potential industrial uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5042)|
| 1:24:23| Well, this was the zoning recommended but not planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| There are two other commercial businesses in that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| And as I understand it, the long-range plan for that area is light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| And even commercial space at C3 or something in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| So anyway, we just went with whatever NOx planning recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Of course. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Let me ask planning a little bit because I definitely saw on the map that this parcel is surrounded by other industrial mixed-use zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5094)|
| 1:25:07| When I see industrial, it doesn't seem like something that should be near residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5107)|
| 1:25:15| So can you help me better understand industrial mixed-use and the plan for that area with that zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5115)|
| 1:25:24| Certainly. I can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| So let me pull up the industrial mixed-use zone was a new zone that was introduced with the new city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5126)|
| 1:25:37| And the intent of that zone was to recognize that we have this mix of industrial uses, light industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5137)|
| 1:25:46| and that over time we anticipate that they will transition to other uses, less intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| And a lot of these are adjacent to older residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| So the mix that is included is not the industrial maybe makes it sound like it's more intense than it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| but the uses that are identified within that zone are not quite that intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| And they are compatible with residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| They do allow residential uses, live-work spaces, those types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| Is that helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| That is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| I just wanted to take a moment and express my sincere gratitude to you, Mr. Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Fish Pantries, and all the volunteers and the staff there for the impact and the commitment that you all have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| to our city and our communities and helping feed those in need for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Thank you. Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Yeah. Ms. Brooks, I just wanted to clarify some of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| So the use, and Mr. Ahrens, his staff is usually the ones that determine the use, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| Or I guess you guys do because you recommended this zone for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Is it considered to be a warehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| I'm not 100% sure if it was our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Usually you are correct, Council Member Ryder, that Peter Ahrens and his staff make those determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5228)|
| 1:27:16| So what might have happened is that there was a conversation with their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| and this was identified as the use that was allowed within most appropriate in the IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| And then when you look at the surrounding zoning designations of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| there's quite a bit of industrial mixed use already in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I'll second Council Member McKenzie's note of gratitude for all the work you and your organization have done to help families in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5260)|

| 1:28:53| Candace Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Ms. Jones, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you, counsel, for having me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| My name is Candace Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| I live at 402 Burns Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| I've spoken with many of you before about the issue that I'm bringing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| This has to do with the noise ordinance that I've been trying to get action on for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| I've lived in my home for 17 years, and despite some tough circumstances, some things have gotten better, some things have gotten a little worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5354)|
| 1:29:24| We've been pretty happy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Unfortunately, some of my neighbors don't believe that noise ordinances seem to be very important, especially when it comes to certain machinery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5366)|
| 1:29:35| specifically the air conditioners that are located to the direct north and direct east of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| One of them we've been able to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| It's mitigated somewhat with our privacy fence, and we've made do as neighbors and gotten along well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| The other one, unfortunately, is in a situation of serious disrepair, and it's a rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| and I have not been able to get any of the owners in the past two years to act on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| It has become an incredible nuisance for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| We can no longer use our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| It affects my children's room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| They can no longer sleep properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| The prior owner, this occurred during 2020, so unfortunately we had very limited opportunity for getting any resolution during the pandemic, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| The property was up and sold beginning of the summer of last year, so I had to start all over with the request to have it mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| That owner, I gave him 30 days before I even contacted him, just to be fair, and I spoke with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| He said yes, he'd check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| And then after two weeks, when he supposedly would show up, nothing happened, so I called again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| Unfortunately, he was quite rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| He proceeded to insult me and refuses to communicate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| That's been just over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| In that time, I've communicated with many of you, also the planning department and the legal department, about my options moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| I've had an audiologist from the university take several readings, and it is approximating the TDOT level for traffic noise at the equivalent for one hour per day, only it's running at our home for about 20 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5456)|
| 1:31:08| We literally have lost our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| There's one room only on our property where you cannot hear air conditioning noise, and I'm here to beseech you for help in resolving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5471)|
| 1:31:21| I mean, someone has to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| If it's not me, it's someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| This little house has been the home of families long before I arrived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| It was a family before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Another child grew up there their entire lives until they went to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Someone has to live there, and someone is going to be at the brunt of this nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| The issue that I'm having right now is, number one, the city of Knoxville exempts HVACs and air conditioners from their noise ordinance unless they're in a state of disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5499)|
| 1:31:49| Many cities actually don't exempt HVACs or air conditioners, and I think that that might be something I would hope the council would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| It is very easy for an owner to let a machine of this sort fall into a state or purchase something and they could do better, and it's a serious encroachment on others' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5517)|
| 1:32:10| Also, once you determine a state of disrepair, I mean, a machine continues to decline over its life, so where is that point of disrepair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| At what point is this normal wear and tear, and is this a state of disrepair that should be addressed by the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| The other issue I'm having is that many people have followed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| I spoke with a lieutenant on the East District who agrees with me that it's very loud, but unfortunately there's been no protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| There's not been a lot of follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| No one really understands how the decibel meter is supposed to be doled out or who should be taking that reading or who speaks to who when it comes to addressing any kind of violation if that's determined to be such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5558)|
| 1:32:50| So I'm here to ask you for two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| One, to consider adding air conditioners into your noise ordinances because it's a very big concern for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5573)|
| 1:33:03| And as you know, our city is only growing, and we're getting a lot of houses and people moving in even closer and closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| And the other is to help formalize a procedure or protocol to help folks like me when we really need people to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| I've been encouraged strongly by the legal department to look into options with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5598)|
| 1:33:25| I have to be honest with you with the way that the property owner has already behaved towards me and because I have reason to believe that he is friends with others in the neighborhood that unfortunately have engaged in certain levels or behaviors of harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5605)|
| 1:33:39| I guess against multiple people but also against me because I've tried to address some other illegal activity in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5619)|
| 1:33:48| I honestly don't think that's the safest option for us either financially for me or to not the subject of retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5628)|
| 1:33:58| So I'm hoping that the city will understand that I'm not the only person surely that is suffering from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| But this I've been asking for two years for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Thank you, Miss Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Some members of council may come speak to you after the conclusion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Yes, that was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| No, I was wrapping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Council members without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220809?start=5661)|
