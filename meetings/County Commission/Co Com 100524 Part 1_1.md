| 3:01:47| Discussion regarding stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| You want me to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| The Stormwater Ordinance Review Committee is continuing to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| We're probably, this month we're starting, this past month we had Mary Haley from AMAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:16| who was chief advisor probably to the Stormwater Advisory Committee that made recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| to the county over the period of the life of the Stormwater Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:31| So she presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| We're in the process of just assembling information still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| and there shortly will be some recommendations probably forthcoming from Mr. Gronju| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10957)|
| 3:02:45| that we think are, we don't have to debate very much about these things that have been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10965)|
| 3:02:53| sort of vetted through the law department, and some of those things will be coming forward to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| Mr. Gronju is here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| I don't know, Chris, do you want to say anything about stormwater today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| or do you want to just stay away from that podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| I know it's dangerous when you come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| He brought Jim with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| We're just, that's kind of the status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| We're still plugging away, and we'll be having stuff coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:24| Discussion regarding alternatives to the Roberts Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| Dan O, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Governor Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11011)|
| 3:03:32| I vote no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:36| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| Currently you follow Roberts Rules of Order as a default mechanism to your commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:45| Roberts Rules is approximately 750 pages of arcane writings that, as you know, has caused some consternation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11025)|
| 3:03:53| When I was a law director in Florida, I rewrote a set of rules for my commission that was about 12 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| I've likewise just learned that the state of North Carolina has approved this writing to govern their board directives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11038)|
| 3:04:07| What I'm approaching the commission about is I'd like to further explore this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| and come back to you with a proposed set of rules other than Roberts Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| But I don't want to go down that path and spend the time and energy to do it if you'd prefer to just stick with Roberts Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:26| Some commissions like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| Some find it burdensome and cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| But, again, I don't want to take the time to work on this if you feel that you're comfortable just sticking with Roberts Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11071)|
| 3:04:38| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| If you do that, come back with something that's a lot more simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:45| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| No, no, I just had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| And, I mean, I've studied the legislative process for years before I ever served on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| And one thing I'll have to say is Roberts Rules of Order are designed for, I think, larger bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11096)|
| 3:05:04| Commission works a little bit differently than the U.S. Senate or the state house or the state senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11104)|
| 3:05:11| And I think that exploring a simpler set of rules for a body of this size might make some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:20| I mean, I'm not going to advocate anything until I actually see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| But I definitely see the difference and have gotten myself in trouble over the years using a legislative style that is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11123)|
| 3:05:31| conducive to a larger body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| And I think that simplifying the rules would probably help folks in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:40| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| Ms. Slaughter, you know, we had the rules committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| This may need to go to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| And we recommended a few things I thought were going to be on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11149)|
| 3:05:54| Are you going to hold off on that so you can do a full treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| Is that the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| I believe that was passed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| No, that was just to clean up some of your preexisting rules and better articulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| But this would be an actual rewrite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:08| And the scrapping of this tome right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| I think this commission needs to give you plenty of time so you can come back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11182)|
| 3:06:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:34| Discussion regarding the industrial park at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11194)|
| 3:06:40| I'd like to withdraw that, Mr. Chairman, because what I was asking for the law director said we could not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:47| but we will be taking care of that later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| Discussion regarding the appointment of the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| I guess that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| I put this on because, you know, we have to choose a regular law director, not a regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11224)|
| 3:07:13| As opposed to our irregular law director we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| Abnormally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| I guess the name is permanent law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11237)|
| 3:07:24| Since we have the budget out of the way, I figured that we need to talk about selecting a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| and a date when you think it would be appropriate to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:36| I know we have to give the lawyers that will be applying, I'd say, at least a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11256)|
| 3:07:42| and give us time to read the resumes and go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11262)|
| 3:07:48| What about after finance or intergovernmental in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| Okay, we can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| Doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:02| For when I need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11282)|
| 3:08:03| How many is on finance and how many is on intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11283)|
| 3:08:06| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| We've got ten on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| No, I don't think we have enough here today, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| Well, that means we don't have enough to get ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:22| Either one, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| So either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| Whatever day, you know, the room might be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| Well, we need to check and I'll know tomorrow or the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11311)|
| 3:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11317)|
| 3:08:41| There will be an article in the paper telling people where to send their resumes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:45| and we'll give them plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| Do you want to do it all in one day and interview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| Did you have something, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| How long do we have to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| What is it, 20 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| 120 days from April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| Oh, you're talking about from April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| From April 8th, Commissioner, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11353)|
| 3:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| Oh, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| I'm just curious, when will the law director be elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:32| When will this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| Two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:35| Two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| So there's, we have to make an interim law director appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11376)|
| 3:09:40| We can't just make it permanent and let Joe serve until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| He's already been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| He's already the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:49| He's an interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| He's not the permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11390)|
| 3:09:51| We have to appoint someone on a permanent basis for the remainder of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| That's why we're not having an election because of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| That's why I had the ordinance to change our charter so that in case in the future we have a vacancy like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11400)|
| 3:10:08| someone can't serve under an appointment for more than two years like is happening this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11408)|
| 3:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| I just like to avoid an appointment process and, you know, but I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| We don't have that time, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| Did you have something else, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| Since this law director is going to be working with the new commission after it's seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11430)|
| 3:10:34| is there any way to postpone this or delay it and let the new commission after it's seated make the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:42| rather than this body doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11445)|
| 3:10:46| You have 120 days from April 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:47| You have to make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:57| On page 14, discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11457)|
| 3:11:03| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| Five on no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| I don't know which one wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| Commissioner Wright signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| Commissioner Chauffeur, I see your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| I thank Commissioner Wright for remembering to put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| I was watching Tuesday morning and he said we should have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:24| And I could have done it the day before, but I forgot and thank him for remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| At the audit committee, we're in somewhat of a dilemma and we want the direction of the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| because this could run into some extra dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| We had attempted to, the county's main auditor is KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11499)|
| 3:11:46| That's who produces the big phone book size document and conforms to GASB and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11506)|
| 3:11:54| For the sake of efficiency and smoothness, we thought that KPMG could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11514)|
| 3:12:03| and audit the Solway, the mulch issue, the alleged, all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:09| the allegations that we hear from Mr. Mays and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| And that was, we put that in motion several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11532)|
| 3:12:16| At the audit meeting on May the 11th, KPMG says, we don't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11536)|
| 3:12:22| And please help me with this if I'm losing some facts to Mr. Saunders and Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11542)|
| 3:12:29| They had a conflict and he gave a fairly long ten-minute explanation why they didn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11549)|
| 3:12:36| I mean, obviously it's going to be sort of a, could be a political hot potato too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| I'm maybe reading too much into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| But bottom line is KPMG does not want to go and look into the Solid Waste situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11563)|
| 3:12:51| and all the allegations and their lawsuits on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11571)|
| 3:12:58| We all know most of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| So that throws the ball back into our end of the court on how do we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11580)|
| 3:13:06| Where do we get the audit, the professional audit staff to go and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| Well, of course, Richard can in theory, but Richard cannot because of the past disputes with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11590)|
| 3:13:19| He cannot ethically go and audit something that's a part of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:25| Well, of course, in three months from now, that's not an issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| Am I right, June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| Three months from now, that's no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| So do we want to wait and let the audit department under Mr. Walls go and audit the Solid Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11612)|
| 3:13:40| or do we want to go out for RFPs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| It's probably going to take, the way this thing works, it's going to take two or three months anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11622)|
| 3:13:47| to get RFPs from auditing firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| So am I more or less correct, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11630)|
| 3:13:54| Please add to this debate or this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| There was one other possibility and that is asking comparable governing internal auditors from perhaps Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11637)|
| 3:14:03| or Hamilton County if they would be willing to engage in that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:08| Richard, I don't know if you've had a chance to check with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:10| We had one decline and one not respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11650)|
| 3:14:15| Well, there's probably two declines, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11655)|
| 3:14:20| It sort of sounds like two declines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| So we are just at the direction of the full commission since this is not a budgeted item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:27| but it's an item that certainly has gotten a lot of media attention and focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| and it's on public forum virtually every meeting and a lot of allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:38| One of the members of the audit committee went out to, I think I mentioned this before, to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11678)|
| 3:14:43| I don't know if she was buying or selling, was she dropping off mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| She was doing a transaction at the, was she selling mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| She was dropping off, so she had to pay the tipping fee to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:55| She had to pay a tipping fee and when seven bucks or something, when she drives off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| the person says, well, you don't need a receipt, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| I'm not saying that person put the seven bucks in their pocket, but that tells you something's amiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:08| It needs some scrutiny from the audit committee and the audit committee serves at the pleasure of the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:14| so we'd like to know what commission, how they, again, that's the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:19| Do you want to wait until there's a new administration and then direct Mr. Walsh to go and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| or start the RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11728)|
| 3:15:29| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| Yeah, this is a very difficult situation and I've personally followed this quietly, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11731)|
| 3:15:39| since we voted on the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11739)|
| 3:15:42| It's probably been a couple of years ago this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| And I think there's been a lot of allegations flying back and forth between both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11746)|
| 3:15:52| There's been suits and counter suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| There's been, you know, recovery suits filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| There's recovery suits under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| And I hope Commissioner Hammond doesn't mind me plagiarizing something he said a long time ago, but it's a real mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:11| But I think from what I've seen, there's enough out there that we have to take the allegations seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:18| I know we can say that the county would have the ability to recover some of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| if indeed the courts rule that there have been some of the funds that the county is due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:31| have not been turned over to the county and that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| But from what I gather the way the courts work, there's really not an audit that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| It's just both sides presents their evidence to see if there's been fraud involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:43| and then the judge makes a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| Some of the allegations are very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| Some of the information that I've seen I would have to say looks very suspicious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:55| and there may be an explanation or there may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| And I'm willing to keep an open mind about it, but just when you have so many things that don't seem right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:07| it really sends up my antennas that something doesn't smell right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:13| And on behalf of the taxpayers and on behalf of really the county, do we need to look at this further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:23| You know, my opinion is that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| I would prefer if we could get this done as a courtesy by one of the auditors from another county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:35| rather than having to spend a lot of money in going through that whole process that we were just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| But I don't think it's anything that we can just say that it's, you know, sire grapes on the part of Brad Mays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11860)|
| 3:17:47| because I think he has uncovered things that are, I'll call them, I'll give everyone the benefit of the doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11867)|
| 3:17:53| and I'll just call them suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| But it's also something that I don't think that we can just push under the rug and say let's let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11875)|
| 3:18:03| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11885)|
| 3:18:06| Commissioner Shouse, listening to you talk there, if we put this out on RFP, it would probably be three months anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:11| Realistically speaking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| And I may be reading between the lines, but I believe you think that after three months there would be no conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11900)|
| 3:18:21| And during the economic times that we're in right now, I think that we need to try to save all the money we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11901)|
| 3:18:27| So if there's no conflict there, I think we should let our internal auditor do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:31| I'm inclined to have that position also, but I wanted to hear that from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11911)|
| 3:18:36| Plus the fact he knows more what rocks to look under than somebody outside might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| I would agree with that, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| Mr. Smith, I know you were there at the meeting, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| and you're the one sort of driving this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11928)|
| 3:18:52| I'd like to make a motion that in three months' time that we let Richard look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11932)|
| 3:18:59| and I will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| Well, after September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| After September 1, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| There's nothing significant about that date, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:14| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11954)|
| 3:19:17| Mr. Chairman, in this situation here, go back to what Dr. Briggs was saying and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:25| I'm like Dr. Briggs, I don't want to accuse or point fingers at anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| but I've seen a lot of information and a lot of things seem to be pretty evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11968)|
| 3:19:35| I think that it needs to be outside for the simple fact that there are too many players| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| that are connected to Knox County Government involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| I mean, there's a lot of people in Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| And to have our person do it, that just brings personalities into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:52| I'd feel a lot more comfortable if we had somebody outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| Yes, it's bad economic times, but from what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| we're looking at over a million dollars that's going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| I want to make sure, you know, that we get all that's due Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:05| Not that Richard Wallace can't do it by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| I'm not saying that, but there are so many personalities that we have that are Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12007)|
| 3:20:13| I think it needs to be done outside just to give a no-nonsense look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12013)|
| 3:20:20| Here's what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| And what the facts are, the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| If I'm wrong in anything, I'll be the first to apologize to whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:27| But I think it definitely needs to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12027)|
| 3:20:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| I'm not speaking to the issue in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| I'm speaking to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| I think that since it's a discussion item, it's not on the agenda as a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12039)|
| 3:20:43| that it might be more proper for us to have something received at the agenda committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| to be on next month's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| especially since we're talking about something that's after September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| I believe that's a point that we need to probably play closer attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12054)|
| 3:20:59| because we're voting on something that's not properly before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| unless we want to take a two-thirds majority vote and say it's an emergency or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| Well, you suspend the rules and add an item to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12071)|
| 3:21:12| So, you know, we've got time to do this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| That's my understanding that that's the reason we put these discussion items on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12076)|
| 3:21:21| so we could make motions off of the discussions, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12081)|
| 3:21:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| I believe you're correct on that because the discussions used to be just at the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:32| and not at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| But it's still the flavor of the board of what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:40| I think issues need to be on the agenda so that people will know to come to these public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:46| and express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| We can't come up in the middle of the night with a new idea unless we've got two-thirds of a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| I'd like to amend the motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| Would I be correct in saying a simple majority would not be appropriate to pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12120)|
| 3:22:07| In this forum, what you would want to do is suspend your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| And in so doing, then you could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| I'll second the motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:22| Did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:23| I amended my motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| Commissioner Lutho, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| I agree with Commissioner Smith that we may need to have someone outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12153)|
| 3:22:41| But I think after September 1 and Richard Walls has a chance to take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| and once that report comes in and if it looks like we do need to have further in-depth analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:55| then maybe the commission and the administration at that time can proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12175)|
| 3:23:00| But I think the first stepping stone ought to be to have the internal auditor take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12180)|
| 3:23:06| and get a good overview of it and then maybe bring in someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12186)|
| 3:23:13| Well, let me ask a question there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| Richard, how soon can you make a decision on something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| I mean, how much time do you spend looking to say, hey, I need somebody else to step in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12199)|
| 3:23:27| I'm willing to go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| I mean, if you want me to do it or do it external, that's fine with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:36| I would say within a month, probably, that I could make some sort of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:42| Well, maybe at your October meeting there would be a chance to proceed on from there with an external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12222)|
| 3:23:53| I mean, I don't care who does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| It needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| But, Richard, you get into it and you think that, hey, I need to step away from it, let somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| And, you know, we need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| Well, the audit committee would more or less decide that after he goes to them, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| That would be his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| But getting back to Commissioner Pinks and what he wants to get back to, if we do suspend the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| I really think that the motion ought to be asking the audit committee to direct the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:23| to take a look at this at a certain time instead of the commission telling the internal auditor to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12263)|
| 3:24:30| I think that's how we're sort of set up, Commissioner Chouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| And that's what this discussion was for, to get direction from commission without running renegade without authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:44| Because you had directed us earlier or this body had directed us earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| and we hit a brick wall when KPMG said, no, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12288)|
| 3:24:53| We would have had it half done or probably completed by now and we would have had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| That's one direction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| We'll amend it to send it to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12300)|
| 3:25:01| But the first thing we'd have to do is suspend the rules before we can go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| And it takes a two-thirds, which would still, although we're only at 17, will still take 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:11| Seeing no other lights, if we could start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:20| Well, maybe we can try without a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12320)|
| 3:25:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12327)|
| 3:25:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12331)|
| 3:25:36| So it carries, at least 15 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12336)|
| 3:25:44| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| Now, what would be the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| I can make a motion to send it to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| And let them determine what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| Well, I thought you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| We're looking for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| Recommendation to send it to the audit committee to recommend that they let Richard start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12357)|
| 3:26:02| September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| After September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12363)|
| 3:26:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12366)|
| 3:26:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:08| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| Third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| Everybody on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12381)|
| 3:26:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| We still have audit committee things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| We have one more that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| Mr. Chairman, still on the discussions of the audit committee, Commissioner Schaust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| I believe we received a couple of internal audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12400)|
| 3:26:43| And I would like for Richard to just say what he's done and where he may be headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:52| One of the areas that we identified in our risk assessment was salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| which is the largest single expense item in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12416)|
| 3:27:01| And right now we've been working in the fee offices that require salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12421)|
| 3:27:10| And, you know, I'm happy to report that, you know, they're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12430)|
| 3:27:14| And, you know, however, we have identified some issues that need to be discussed prior to the next salary suits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12434)|
| 3:27:23| which, in fact, tonight with the budget approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12443)|
| 3:27:29| they have 30 days to file their salary suits for this next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12449)|
| 3:27:35| And there was really only a few items that we referred to the law department just to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12455)|
| 3:27:41| again, just in consideration of the next salary suits that are filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12461)|
| 3:27:51| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12472)|
| 3:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12473)|
| 3:27:54| One thing to keep in mind is that since this is an election year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12474)|
| 3:27:59| and there will be some new fee offices that come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12479)|
| 3:28:03| is that new officers can file their own salary suits once they take office September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12483)|
| 3:28:13| So I just wanted to let you all know that as just for an informational sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12493)|
| 3:28:25| Is that all from the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| Only one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| I need some clarification on the public hearing you want to have at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12510)|
| 3:28:37| You want to get with me about a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| We have one more discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| Pam Reese report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12526)|
| 3:28:49| Who put that on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12531)|
| 3:28:52| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12532)|
| 3:28:53| There's a copy of that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:54| Does that come from the law director's office or how can we get a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| We have a copy in my office and certainly welcome to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12538)|
| 3:29:04| Copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:05| For some reason, memory serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| I thought I distributed that the day we received it, but if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| Can you leave me a copy in the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12553)|
| 3:29:14| I'd like a copy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| I'll make a copy for the complete commission and we'll get that to you immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| Was she going to come and talk about what she found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| I don't believe that was the arrangement, but I'm sure she would if asked to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:31| We got that on e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| Yeah, that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12573)|
| 3:29:34| My thoughts were I sent it to you the day I received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=12574)|
