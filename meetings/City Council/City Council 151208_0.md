| 0:02:04| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Yes, I understand that 10B is being withdrawn. That is the resolution dealing with Magpie's zoning appeal with regard to the advertising or art structure on her building that she was proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=125)|
| 0:02:26| Right, so that's a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| Any opposed? That item is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| Any others? Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| We don't have any consent items tonight, so we're to the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| First, I do want to acknowledge the passing of a major figure in our community. As you all know, Henrietta Grant died last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| Mrs. Grant was a lifelong educator, and she made a huge impact as principal of Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| During those tumultuous years, as the city schools were absorbed in by the county schools, and she also steered the schools through the establishment of a performing arts magnet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=188)|
| 0:03:20| And along the way, she earned a National Milken Educator Award for her efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| She retired in 1998, but she remained active until her death as a community volunteer, serving on many boards, including our airport authority board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| She always showed a very deep concern for the well-being of all people in our community, particularly young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| So we will all miss her, I know, and I know our thoughts and prayers are with her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| Two important events are coming up from both our fire and our police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| Tomorrow, Wednesday, December 9th at 6 p.m. at the Civic Auditorium, we will have the graduation ceremony for our new class of Knoxville Fire Department recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| This is a great group of 32 new firefighters who have just completed their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| And from what I understand, this may be the biggest graduating class we've ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| All right. And I know, Chief Sharp, you're ready to put them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| They're ready to get to work after all that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| And then next week, the police department will have a promotion ceremony for several deserving officers who will be moving up the ranks to sergeant or lieutenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=264)|
| 0:04:33| That will be at 3 p.m. on Thursday, December 17th at Overcoming Believers Church, which is 211 Harriet Tubman Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| OVC is great partners with us and have a special relationship with our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| So it's nice that we're having it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| So please join us for both of these events and help congratulate and recognize all of these officers and firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| So we have some more Christmas in the City events coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| We all had a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Those of us on the float for the WIVK Christmas parade, that was a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Your little son and I think it was Tasha's grandson, they were saying Merry Christmas with such a vengeance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| Everybody, we passed. It was amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| But this Friday, we will have the annual Xfinity Christmas at Chilhowee with the tree lighting on the bandstand at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| a visit from Santa and all kinds of family activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| And Mayor Brown will be emceeing that event for us, so come join him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| That all begins at 6 p.m. this Friday, December 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| You can find all the details on our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| And again, you can download our special events app by searching for Knoxville events in the app stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| There will be a public meeting to talk about plans for the new streetscapes on Sevier Avenue this Thursday, December 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| at 5.30 p.m. at South Knox Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Proposed improvements include a new two-lane streetscape with bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| improved sidewalks, street lighting, on-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| and a new roundabout at the intersection of Sevier and Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| So you can get details about all of that and see the designs, the proposed designs, at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Again, that's at 5.30 this Thursday at South Knoxville Elementary School at 801 Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| And a reminder that next week we will officially be opening the City of Knoxville section of the Knox Blunt Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| I see Lori smiling out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| This ribbon-cutting will be on Tuesday, December 15th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Parking for the event is at the Cherokee Farm Innovation Campus there at 1709 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| So this is nearly two miles of a greenway along the Tennessee River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| two miles of greenway along the Tennessee River, which connects across the Buckharnes Bridge to our Neyland Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| which then creates about 18 miles of connected greenway in and around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| This is the first leg of what is envisioned as a greenway system that will run all the way from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| through the balance of Knox County and Blunt Counties to the Great Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| So this is very exciting for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| It's a great new amenity for local runners, walkers, and cyclists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and I think it represents the future for us too and what we're trying to do with our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| Finally, I want to remind everybody that our next council meeting will not be two weeks from tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| because that's a little too close to the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| So we're actually having it next Thursday, December 17th at 7 p.m. again here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| So it was originally going to be December 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| So the next meeting is Thursday, December 17th at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| That meeting on the 17th, let's see, what am I saying here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| So the next regular council meeting then would be Tuesday, January 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| except we have a special called meeting on Saturday, the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| That's when I get inaugurated for the second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and our four council members that were just reelected, they get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| That's Councilman Saunders, Steyer, Wallace, and Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| That's Saturday, December 19th in this room at 1030 in the morning, and the public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| We hope people will come out for that inauguration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| A light reception will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| We've got some entertainment and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| It will be a festive occasion, so we hope you'll all come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| And then right after the inauguration, as people are starting on that light reception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| we'll hold a quick council meeting in the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| to elect a vice mayor, the beer board chair, and the CAT board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| So please join us Saturday, December 19th at 1030 a.m. in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| the large assembly room of the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| There's free parking available at the Dwight Kessel Garage, the Main Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and the city-county building garage will also be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| though it will be a little slower because we have to do security to get you into that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| And then everyone will have to go through security to get into this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| But we look forward to seeing you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Are there council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I'd like to bring council up to date on the issue that has been taking place with El Charros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| and the Bearden Council on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| We've had a, you might say, eleventh-hour compromise has been reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| in terms of the Bearden Council is withdrawing their appeal with the El Charros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| And also I want to let council know there was an article in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| that talked about one of our second meetings that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| where we were working with both the Bearden Council and El Charros to reach a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| And personally I felt that it wasn't a very positive article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| It wasn't written from the standpoint of the spirit of what really went on during that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| And I just want to pass on to council the fact that we had both parties were involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| and both parties spent several hours hashing out different opinions about what they felt about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| The Bearden Council was very much involved in the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| which has been in effect for over 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| And there was very much concern over the fact that the compromises that were going to have to be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| had to do with really the location of the building and curb cuts and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| that really went against what the Bearden Plan is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| As you folks know, some of the goals for the Bearden Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| and for that whole Bearden area or the Bearden Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| is that we want to have a continuous pedestrian environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| And this has been worked on very hard over the last few years to create that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| not only with the greenways but the sidewalks and the different developers who have come into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| who have put sidewalks and landscaping into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| You all also may recall that I had asked MPC if they would look at the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| for the example of what we could have in terms of a mixed-use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| And MPC is very much involved right now in putting that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| which we hope to have some public meetings, and this should happen fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| We have a number of developers who are interested in not only the commercial aspect of the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| but also in providing housing, both in terms of apartments and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| So what finally happened, and I have to give credit to Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Gerald's not here tonight, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| I tell you, Gerald spent a long time not only looking at the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| in terms of what could happen in the Bearden area and on this particular lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| but he spent a lot of time with us and the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| and with the El Charro folks in terms of helping to develop this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| Also, I want to thank Terry Faulkner, who is president of the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| The Bearden Council is made up of neighborhoods and businesses throughout that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| and between Gerald and Terry, and then also the Arandas, who also attended all the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| and they participated and listened and helped work out a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| And basically what the compromise is is that the location of the building and the curb cuts will occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| but they have agreed to extensive landscaping along the pedestrian corridor through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| in terms of trees and extensive landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And so finally yesterday at the last hour, a memorandum of understanding was signed by both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| and the Arandas are going to be able to go ahead and close on the property, I think tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| so that they'll go ahead and be able to build the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| But I do want to stress that this was really a cooperative effort of two groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| that really worked together for the success, and it has ended up that it's a win-win for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| And as I said, I do hope that the press will print the fact that this was all very done positively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| and that it was work that a lot of people were involved with, so I wanted to report to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| The other thing that I guess I could bring up at this time, I'm going to have to recuse myself from 10A on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| As far as any discussion or vote, I've checked with our legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and I'm very much involved on a professional basis with one of the adjoining neighbors to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| and so it's been recommended that I recuse myself from 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you. Any other reports from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=813)|

| 0:14:42| 10A is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| approving an appeal by Daniel A. Sanders of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| to reduce the minimum number of required parking spaces from 59 spaces to 5 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| per Article V, Section 7.A.3.A table, property located at 937 North Broadway, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| Okay. Hello, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| If possible, I'd like to defer my remarks until the other side goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Well, let's see. We've got – let me tell you our rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So the way Council rules are is we first hear from the appellant, which would be you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| and then you have up to five minutes, and then we hear from the respondent, if I get that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| which is, I guess, Gary Tenner. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| I think it's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Oh, you are. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Herschel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Okay, right. Then who's Gary Tenner? That's you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And you want to speak against –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| For Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Oh, for Mr. Sanders. Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| So first we will hear from the two, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Tenner, and then you each have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| Then they respond with – they can have up to three people, five minutes each, and then you get a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| I got that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| So, Mr. Sanders, set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Appreciate you being here, and I'm going to set the timer, and I'll let you know when it gets close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| My name is Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I live at 714 Haynes Place in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917, closer than 0.2 miles from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=981)|
| 0:16:31| As a crow flies, it's about a tenth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Speak a little louder into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| As I said, I live about a tenth of a mile from this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| I'm here to ask the Council to approve my appeal and, therefore, reverse the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| and deny the requested variance for reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces from 59 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| This property is located at 937 North Broadway and is zoned C3 for general commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| The C3 zone regulation can be found at your zoning ordinance, section 2.2.6, beginning at subsection A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1025)|
| 0:17:15| The district, and I quote, is intended to include areas where commercial development has displaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| or is displacing residential development, and that's exactly what we see in this area up and down the Broadway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| The ordinance continues that the regulations are designed to guide the future change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| so as to discourage the formation of future commercial slums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| and to preserve the carrying capacity of the streets and to provide off-street parking and loading and unloading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| So that's what the ordinance is designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| How do the regulations do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Well, they have certain permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| and then they have minimum parking requirements that are assigned to those specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| When these regulations work together, we should expect to see the benefits of orderly development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| including the avoidance of commercial slums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| We should maintain the carrying capacity of the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| and we should avoid stress on neighbors by failure to have enough off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| and that's what this variance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| It says you don't need the number of off-street parking required by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Instead of almost 60 spaces, you can do your business with five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| Under the zoning scheme, under the zoning laws, as the zoning laws are interpreted by the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| you have to use your property according to the rules until you're entitled to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| So when are you entitled to a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Well, your ordinance lays those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Article 7, Section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| variance should be granted only when special circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Essentially what the applicant is asking you to do here is to find that their property is not big enough to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| That's what they're claiming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| However, this building and this lot are very common in the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| If you look up and down the Broadway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| you're going to find lots that are similar in size and buildings that are similar to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| If you look at the map that's in the record that was filed that came up in my application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| you'll see this property is in a cluster of what I assume are old residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| There are some different lots, but they're bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| The bigger lots are going to be the exceptions in the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| So I don't think that the applicants or the property owners in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| can prove that they are entitled to a variance based on some sort of unusual circumstance that exists in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1200)|
| 0:20:10| The next requirement for granting a variance under your zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| is they shall not be granted to allow use other than is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| This isn't one of those situations, so we'll skip to the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| the aforementioned circumstances or conditions...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| You have one minute, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| The real reason why you should grant my appeal and reverse the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1237)|
| 0:20:50| is that there is nothing in the record that proves that they're entitled to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| The board did not consider alternate uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| They did not fulfill their responsibility to make sure that they grant the minimum variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1260)|
| 0:21:09| In fact, if you look at the ordinance, there are other uses that are permitted in this district that require less parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| By granting the variance for a restaurant use, which is the most intense use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1280)|
| 0:21:34| they actually granted the maximum variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I would request that you reverse the variance, grant my approval, and I'll wait for my rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1297)|
| 0:21:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Now, Mr. Tanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| Name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I am Gary Teener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I'm with Broadway Carpets, 930 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you for allowing me to address council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| My remarks will be short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| We're the building and the parking lot directly across the street from 937 North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| and we are against this variance and for Mr. Sanders' appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| As you know, this variance is taking required parking from 59 spaces down to five spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1339)|
| 0:22:29| Five spaces where 59 spaces are required will force people to find another place to park if they are patrons of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1349)|
| 0:22:39| Employees will take up most of the five spaces they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and the question is where are these customers going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| The only parking spaces available are right across the street at Broadway Carpets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| No other businesses in this area have been willing to lease parking to the present owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| and we're concerned about what this parking will do to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| We're concerned about what it will do to our customers' ability to enter our parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and to exit our parking lot safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| If you've got another business right across the street encroaching upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| we're concerned about what type of business will be going in directly across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| We've been told it will be a bar arcade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| We've been told it will be a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We've been told it will be a takeout deli with video game sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| We've been told it's been some sort of retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| and we're concerned because all of those mentioned businesses need more parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| and the only parking available is directly across the street at our parking space, our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| This variance allows a business to go into this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| but since it cannot provide the proper access, since it cannot provide the proper parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| it forces those customers to encroach upon other businesses nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| We, Broadway Carpets, then respectfully ask that this variance be denied by approving Mr. Sanders' appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Okay, now for the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| How many speakers do you have, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Just you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Are you Mr. Kershaw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| So just state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| and I'll set the timer for up to five minutes, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| My name is Ben Kershaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| I live at 5712 Outer Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921, and I am the owner of 937 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| I have a couple of packets of information to provide to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Who do I distribute these to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Somebody, can you get those maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| So I'm here to ask you to deny this appeal today regarding the parking variance at 937 North Broadway, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1494)|
| 0:25:04| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| As Mr. Sanders established, variances are granted to businesses and homes that have extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| that prevent them from applying within the code of Knoxville City Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Our building is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| We require 59 spots, and we only have five available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| That's it, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| If we were to demolish the building, pave it, and then turn it into a parking lot, we'd be lucky to get maybe 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| And then what's the point of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| In Mr. Sanders' application, he said that the variance was arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| If you look at the first page of your packet that I have handed you, you will see a list of comparable variances within the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| the furthest one being 4.7 miles away at an extreme outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| The first highlighted one is 1320 North Broadway with a comparable variance of 50 spots to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| with a reduction of 46 spaces or 92% of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| This is the building at which Bread Heads, Kbrew, and a few other local businesses are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| The other one that is highlighted is 104 East Fifth Avenue with a reduction of 50 to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| obviously 50 spots and 100% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Therefore, there's precedence for a variance this drastic set forth by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| On the second page, you will also see uses of the C3 City Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| which have highlighted delicatessens and bakeries, eating and drinking establishments, and brew pubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| indicating that the implied usage of this building is within the uses of C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| And for funsies, since it was supposed to be an arcade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I have also highlighted the indoor commercial recreational structures and uses such as theaters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| bowling alleys, and pool rooms, just so that everything is up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Mr. Sanders also noted that the item was improperly noticed and or applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| If you go to the next page, you will see a clipping from the Knoxville News Sentinel from September 4, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| stating, well, you can read it yourself, but as it says, 59 spaces to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| This means that it was indeed improperly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| As for the application, when we first applied for the variance on August 14, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| it was initially to reduce our parking from 15 spots to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| We were told the parking required applied only to the space occupied by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| with consideration to fixtures and furniture, as indicated by our floor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| which is the next two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| One of them is double-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Only the highlighted area on the main floor was intended for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| The rest is not for public occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| In fact, most of the basement is actually an unoccupiable crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| Where was I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| However, on August 31, 2015, we were informed by Scott Elder that the parking required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| is actually based on the total square footage of the building rather than just the main floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| We amended our application to reflect this the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| The public notice regarding the variance hearing was unpublished, of course, September 4, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| and states the hearing was to reduce parking spots from 59 to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| As for Mr. Tiener's comments regarding us parking in his lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| he and I have discussed this matter a few times, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| When we first purchased the building, we were under the impression that Mr. Tiener was a bit more accommodating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| with his parking lot, and I admit openly that that was naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| However, we had based this assumption on a Facebook post made by the Three Rivers Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| that previously occupied the building, stating that it was okay to park at Broadway Carpets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| We have since spoken with Mr. Tiener and discovered that he does not want us parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| So I told him I also do not want my people parking there as crossing Broadway is a liability for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| However, it has not stopped Mr. Tiener's crusade to prevent us from opening by fighting us in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| His parking lot is not my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| What is his responsibility is policing it via gates, signs, or towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| However he wants to do it is entirely up to him, but it is not my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| And I believe that is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| And thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| And now, Mr. Sanders, you get a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Five minutes is clearly not enough time to do what you need to do at these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| and I'm on the other side of this most of the time and completely have a feel for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| A different perspective now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Look, I've heard what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Still no proof of a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| What he's saying is I want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| The property that I purchased to do this thing is not big enough to do this thing that I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Give me a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| If a person were entitled to a variance based on that alone, you have no zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| You have no parking regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| You have no setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| People will buy property to do things that the property is not big enough to do and come to you for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| And if this is what you grant the variance based on, everybody gets one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| He said we have to have 59 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Don't have to have 59 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| There are other permitted uses in this zoning district that require less parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| Just by that fact alone, the Board of Zoning Appeals, and they're asking for the maximum variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| Ten parking spaces per 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| You won't find another use that requires more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| They can put the building to another use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| That's not been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| There's been no proof that they've been denied every reasonable use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| There are other uses they can put the property to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| As far as policing, Mr. Tenor's responsibility to police his parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1842)|
| 0:30:51| Well, what I mentioned earlier about the design of these regulations is the regulations are designed to police the stress on the neighborhood and the carrying capacity and on-off street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1851)|
| 0:31:03| If the board grants the variance, it's putting Mr. Tenor in a position where he might feel the stress from 60 parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| Well, I guess 55 people parking want to come over to his lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| Where are they all going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| With that, I would ask that you grant the appeal, overrule the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Councilman Daldopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Before you sit down, Mr. Sanders, I understood in looking at the record before the BZA that originally this was supposed to be sort of a restaurant and bar combination that was being applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1888)|
| 0:31:42| and then the applicant learned that, one, he couldn't have beer sales within so many feet of the Boys and Girls Club, and he didn't meet that standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1902)|
| 0:31:53| and also that he was having trouble with the parking issue, and he decided to locate elsewhere his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| He happens to own this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Is that correct, the first part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Well, I'll let him speak for himself, but I will say, direct your attention to the minutes of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I assume are in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| They said that basically because of the beer distance rule, they can't operate the business at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| And he said that he was leasing another property to undertake that business, the reason for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| Did you see that in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Right, and they're not really clear on what use they're going to put the property to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| And maybe I should ask that gentleman, Mr. Kershaw, that, but he was told, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| since you applied only for a restaurant, we're going to take it up on that basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| even though it might be better suited for an office or some less intensive use, which has less parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Mr. Kershaw, do you want to answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| You're actually asking for a variance for a business you're not going to run at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| Well, and just to put a finer point on it, they actually applied for a less intense variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| than the city ended up forcing them to follow through with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| That was what was noticed, so that's what he had to be heard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| Mr. Kershaw, would you go ahead and tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Isn't it true that you changed direction in terms of you bought it to build your barcade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| That didn't work, and so you're going to rent that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| and you found another space to lease that will work for your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| We found a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| However, we feel that a restaurant would do very well in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| due to the lack of local eateries in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and so if possible we would like to lease it out to a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Do you think they're going to have more than five customers a night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Actually, if you still have the packet I presented to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| if you flip to the second-to-last page, you will notice a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| showing the blue-highlighted area as our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| and the Forth and Gill area, or at least a small portion of it, highlighted in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| Forth and Gill has been and always will be the area we were targeting with this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| as it is our primary demographic, as indicated by the page afterwards, I believe, if that is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| That said, if you look at the proximity of our building to Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| I don't think it's absurd to assume that they could walk or bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| It is a very pedestrian and cyclist-friendly neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| and it is completely within the realms to walk or bike to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| Did you make any other arrangements for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Have you looked at other arrangements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| We attempted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| However, everyone within the area was unwilling or unable to lease parking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| This was a residence at one time converted to a store, and now your request for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| I'm not entirely familiar with all of the history of the building, but I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Do you have a tenant that's going to open a restaurant there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We have a few in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Nothing is really solid yet, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Your partner in crime seems to be raising her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I'm not sure what she had the answer that maybe you want to defer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| One other thing I would like to present to you regarding said parking leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| I kind of forgot about this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I'm going to present to you some letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| You are the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| These two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Which is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| What's the import of the two letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Oh, those two letters were obtained by Gary Teener regarding two local other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| that would not lease to us, namely McCoy Motor Company and KCDC regarding their parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| That's in the record, too, and that's EZA, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Yes, that's from the original record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I went ahead and printed out copies just in case it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| This is the part that confuses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I know Mr. Teener is very concerned about people parking in his lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| but is it not counterproductive to go behind us and attempt to stop leasing from other parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| that would solve our parking issue and alleviate stress from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Do you know that he did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| He presented it at the BZA meeting that we are here discussing the appeal of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| Let me go back to where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| That's your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I'm just concerned that we're applying for a pretty major reduction in the number of spaces needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| but we don't really know the ultimate use at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| What if it was a lesser demanded use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| For example, I think someone pointed out that you might have an office space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| That appears to, instead of requiring ten spaces per thousand, requires five spaces per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| I feel that an office building wouldn't really mesh with the overall feel of the Broadway area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| especially with the Broadway Corridor Project coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| but that might just be my misunderstanding of the Broadway Corridor Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Is it your contention under the variance standard that there's no other use you can make of this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| no other reasonable use you can make of this land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| We could make it a retail space, such as a store of some sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| but I feel like a restaurant would fit in very well in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Like I said, there's not much in the way of local eateries for the Forth and Gill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Do you know that the variance statute says that you have to show that it would deprive you of any reasonable use of your land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| and that the mere loss in value does not justify a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| It must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| You can't use it for anything. It's kind of the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| I was not aware of that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I'll go back to Mr. Kershaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| So the main floor, that's your intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| You're going to use the main floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Yes, that was the intended space for the arcade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| So the rest, even though the parking requirement at 59 is based on the total square footage of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| the only part you intend to use is the 1,760 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| So how old is this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Like I said, I'm not very familiar with the entire history of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| but I believe it was built approximately 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Was that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Approximately 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| So it's approximately 100 years old, so it's been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And it covers a great portion of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| So no matter what use you put on there, you're still limited to five parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| It's not a question of the use is not driving it as much as your uniqueness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| and the reason you're asking for the variance is that there's simply not enough real estate on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| to have parking for any type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Five is the maximum of what you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| So that is your unique request and why you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| So based on 1,760 square feet, you still may not have enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| but it's really the usable and what you intend to use it for is far less than 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Hold on before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Was this not the food co-op at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So, I mean, there had to be lots of people coming in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| We parked across the street when the five spaces were used up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| Under the same ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Currently, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| We are different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| No, no, no, not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| The Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| I think they were kind enough to allow people to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| or at least they didn't stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| I don't know if there was an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Yes, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Yeah, and just to follow up on that, I mean, when the co-op was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| did they have a variance, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Or does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| Does MPC have a position, take a position on these matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| He's not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Does MPC have a position on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| And I guess the reason why I ask that, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| this fundamentally shows that the zoning code is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| When we get a list, you know, we've got, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| we've got a suburban zone in a non-suburban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| And it requires all this parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| And unless you want just a huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| unless you just want just a giant surface parking lot all through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| Central and Broadway, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| we're going to have to grant these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| And it looks like from this, that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Live in the area, K-Brew and Breadhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| that place is extremely popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| It's on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I guess the space is reduced from 50 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And I think it's a tremendous asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| I'm disappointed that the applicant doesn't have a more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| a better, more concrete idea of what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| But I guess I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| In fact, does MPC have a position on these variances in this zone for this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| I don't know that we have a position in the sense that the action was taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| by the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| which is a separate board from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| The MPC staff does prepare the public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| and post the signs for the Board of Zoning Appeals, collect the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| And that's the extent of the involvement, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| that we have with the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I do attend the meetings and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| The issue with regard to whether it should be 59 or 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| that was an interpretation that was made by the building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| looking at the total square footage of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| not knowing exactly what portion of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| that would be occupied by the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| The access to the second floor is by an internal stairway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| There's no way of knowing whether or not they expand onto the second floor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Is there any use that would not require a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Is there any use of the building that would not require a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| A dwelling, but a dwelling's not permitted in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Okay, so we've got a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Anything it's used for legally is going to need a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| It was the co-op previously, as Mr. Pavlis stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| It's a tough situation, and I think it's really a result of a broken zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| of a suburban code for a non-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| we're trying to have commercial in a more dense environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| It puts us in a tough spot, but given what we've done previously for all these places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| drastic reductions in the required amount of spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and just to think, to get 59 spaces, you would need this whole block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| and you would just have this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and that's not the way I would want that area to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| That's my two cents, so I'm not going to be supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Okay, Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I'm going to make a motion that we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| No other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Councilman Grieve abstains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| What is the current vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| Two in favor of denying the appeal and four against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| No, it's the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Yeah, did people vote the way they had intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| So if you support Mr. Kershaw, you vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| So did everybody realize that when they went around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Okay, can we try that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Can we start the roll call again for clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Because I think people, what's the proper thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Marshall's the only one who's confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Yeah, does anybody want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I have four people who have said they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| they do not, they support Mr. Sanders basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Okay, then everyone's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So I'd vote yes to support the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Right, motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So it's a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| So if it ties, then the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| But if there's no motion, then that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| You may choose to break the tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| You do not choose to break the tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Who hired you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| I want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I do not choose to vote on this because I have not done the homework that you all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| not knowing that there would be a recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| So I wouldn't be prepared to vote on this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| So I do not choose to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So I'm going to make a motion to approve the appeal then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| I guess we have to formally do that, even though it seems like we just did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Do we have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| You'd have to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I'm not calling the law director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Because you've already denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| That was the motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| The motion was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| That motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| So now the floor is back open for an alternative motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| which is the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| The only alternative motion being a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| To approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| You vote in favor of approving the appeal if you agree with Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| Is this what we learned on the Prior Brown garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| This is what we're still learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Actually, someone failed to learn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| But this is a perfect example of why that's really a difficult decision to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| Because what you've got is a motion to deny, which under Robert's rules is not really a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| It's a negative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| You're supposed to make an affirmative motion under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| The proper motion here would have been a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| But the truth is, unless somebody changes their vote, you're going to end up 4-4 either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| Which means that's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| And if the appeal fails, then you go back to where you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Where you were is the motion to deny wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| But I will make the motion to approve, and let's just get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| This is a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| So if you agree with Mr. Sanders, you vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| If you agree with Mr. Kershaw, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2951)|

| 0:49:25| So Mr. Kershaw's appeal, I mean his...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Mr. Sanders' appeal fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Everyone, for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you for that confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| 11A is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the City of Knoxville necessary to purchase a permanent drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| and a temporary construction easement within certain real property located at 2112 Martha Berry Drive from Robert and Elizabeth Emery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| for a total amount of $455 as part of the 2013 Neighborhood Drainage Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| 11B is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Data Transfer Solutions, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| in an amount not to exceed $295,280 to provide inventory, data, and asset assessment service for traffic signs and guard rail systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3020)|
| 0:50:30| on streets maintained by the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Councilman Dela Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Is David Bray still here or did he disappear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| He is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Well, I don't know whether it's him or Mr. Hagerman, but I thought David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Well, what's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| We'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Obviously, we have these signs and guard rails and we kind of know where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Why are we spending the $300,000, in essence, to make an electronic data accessible, you know, system of this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3049)|
| 0:50:59| I mean, how do we benefit by formalizing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| The immediate driver for this is federal regulations that require a certain level of retro reflectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| which is to say it's got to be visible when your headlights shine on it and you're in line with that light source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| And this inventory is going to check the retro reflectivity for all of these signs so that we know we replace the ones that are not compliant with federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3083)|
| 0:51:36| But the extra benefit that we get from that is knowing exactly where they are, exactly what's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| and exactly what their condition is, which allows us to manage them proactively instead of waiting for somebody to complain about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| If we wait for complaints, we open ourselves up for liability for safety issues on the street primarily, but secondarily liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3113)|
| 0:52:06| But why not two regular guys in two regular trucks riding around with a map saying yes, no, yes, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| We actually have a system like that right now, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| It's old-fashioned, but it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| So every few years – it's been several years, but every few years in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| we'd have people spending a significant amount of their time driving around and checking where signs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| This allows us to track it when we replace one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| We change it in the inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| We know that it's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| We know what the history of that particular sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| We know when it should be changed the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| So your records are up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| We know their ages, and we know their conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| We know proactively when they should be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| Does the consultant slap the new surface like the decal on my license plate that makes it reflective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| or he just notes not reflective and puts it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| He notes not reflective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We have a sign-making shop, and last year at last year's budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| we put aside some capital money to replace some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| because we do anticipate that we're going to find a bunch of them out there that need to be replaced fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| We have a total of about 50,000 signs out there, and talking to various vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| we expect there to be 5% to 10% of those that are going to be in need of replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3214)|

| 0:54:27| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Obviously, we've got ADA requirements, and you have people go out there and saw the concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| break it up, and make smooth dippies so you can get down to the road level, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| And is that price of about $2,000 plus per curb cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| Is that reasonable as far as you can tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Well, it was bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| It was competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| It was competitively bid, so that was the best deal we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3293)|

| 0:55:55| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| I see that Joe sat here patiently all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| I'd like to ask him to come up if he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| Joe, we had a contract several years ago to start doing all this design or examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| and kind of designing various greenways that we thought were priority projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| Why more study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| What triggers that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Actually, it's a continuation of the same study, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| We are examining, doing a feasibility assessment of 13 corridors throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| Ross Fowler is conducting that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| We've been meeting extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Lori Gerlich, our Parks and Greenways Coordinator, and David Crate with Ross Fowler have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| working hand-in-hand for all these months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| They've developed the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| We've reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| It's been by our civil engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| They've reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| We've taken it to our Greenways Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| They've had input as part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| It's gone back to the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Why aren't we ready to build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| That's kind of what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Why aren't we ready to build instead of studying and more studying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Well, I think we are getting close to being ready to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I know we have money budgeted for greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| We just need to make sure that out of these 13, we've done our due diligence and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| we're prepared to present it to the administration so the mayor, I guess, and council can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| which corridors will be priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| But this is a long-term plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Obviously, this is a very important plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| It's going to be, I guess, setting the way for the next decade or two decades as to where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| But, Joe, if I might add, I think what happened, though, is as a result of all the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| the first draft is there presented and then the Greenways Commission and staff went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| it very carefully, you know, sidewalk by sidewalk and inch by inch and really looked at it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| made some significant recommendations, I think, for some additional analysis and maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| I saw a list from the Greenways Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| So it's my understanding that now Ross Fowler will take these, the comments from the Greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| Commission, who put a lot of time into this, and the staff, and will then make some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| And it's been very comprehensive and very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| So we're continuing to, we're moving towards the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Fine-tuning the plan so we can let loose the building effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| The Greenways Commission, you know, they're the ones that are riding the bikes and walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| the trails, and they came up with some other suggestions, as well as staff, on how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| improve that original draft, you know, which is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| You hire consultants, they work on it, they bring some ideas, you vet it through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| public process, and then when you get those changes that are recommended, then they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| back and have to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| So I think we're still in that phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| So it's going to take a little longer because we had some really good input from staff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| the Greenways Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Let her rip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3529)|

| 0:58:58| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3538)|

| 1:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Mr. Johnson brought this to my attention that under an old ordinance, the members of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| had a lot more discretion with the hiring of the Internal Auditor and the setting of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| the wages of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| However, and I believe effective in 2000, there was an amendment to the Charter which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| placed that, I guess loosely speaking, into the Civil Service, where there was criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| developed, and Civil Service would be more involved with that process and the setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| of the salary for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| And what the proposed ordinance before you tonight does is bring the ordinance into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| to reflect the applicable provision of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3689)|

| 1:04:19| I wanted Mr. Seymour to answer that this property, with its high visibility and 80,000 some odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| cars a day moving into our city right past this location, that it's going to be a climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| controlled storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| You're using the current building, so a lot of the façade will continue to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| It won't have a bunch of orange roll-up doors from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| All of the façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| The building will remain as is now, and there's really no room on the lot to expand it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| it'll remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Yeah, I just want to ask Mr. Seymour or Mr. Green, what, no, you don't hear, Mr. Dan Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3899)|
| 1:05:09| going from C3 to C6 is essentially to allow a mixed use on that site, both office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Is that the rationale for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| The C6 zone will allow a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| The adjoining property is already zone C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| It's sandwiched between various commercially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| The adjoining property is zone C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| It would be an extension of that zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Mr. Seymour, can you just talk about the intended use and how that makes sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Tie that together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| The intended use, Councilman Delevaux, is for a storage facility, which is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| in a C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| The only two zones that it's permitted in is C4 and C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| C6 has more regulations after consultation with MPC staff when we filed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| They requested the C6 zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| That's the plan review addition that MPC would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| We have a motion and a second, and this is the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Nobody has signed up for public forum, so that's all of our business, and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151208?start=3986)|
