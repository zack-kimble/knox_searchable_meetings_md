| 0:03:41| Now it's time for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I want to start by thanking everyone who helped make the City's Festival on the 4th a big success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| I had the opportunity to go down and walk around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| and it's always just so heartwarming to see such a diverse group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| people of all ages and backgrounds, enjoying the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| It was family-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| There was all kinds of games, food, music, live music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| And then, of course, the fireworks at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| So we're really pleased to have the symphony down under the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| I thought that went really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| And while it was a holiday for the people who attended, it was a lot of work for many city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| So I want to thank Knoxville Police Department, Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| our public service crews, traffic engineering, and our special events team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| They did a great job, and everybody stayed hydrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| It was very, very hot, but everybody stayed in the shade and stayed hydrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| and there were no issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| So we were very grateful, and people had a really good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| So thanks to everyone who made that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| I also want to remind council members and the public that this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| the latest group of KPD recruits will graduate and then start the field training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| So this ceremony will take place at 6 o'clock at First Apostolic Church, 5020 Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| So please come out and help celebrate these seven new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| That's this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| And also, council members, I think you got a little preview of this at your dinner or workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| or something you had a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| but I want to thank you all again for supporting the significant staff increases we added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| to our plans, reviews, and inspections team back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| Those changes have been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| We added nine new staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| upgraded the software systems for our development services team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| and we are seeing really big improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| So even though the city continues to have record number of permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| mostly residential, which is good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| we have exceeded all of our benchmarks and sped up our turnaround times significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| So we plan to continue to build on this momentum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| including a recently added development facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| This person will walk customers through the development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| coordinate answers to questions, and assist with obtaining permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| So we will keep you up to date on the progress and on this new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and any other new additions as they roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| But we thought that these changes would make a difference, and they're really helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=382)|

| 0:06:59| Thank you in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Council Member Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Yes, I want to give a transit report finally, a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| For two years, CAT and the city of Knoxville have been working on, I guess, microtransit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| on-demand transit, whatever, so they finally have agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and they're going to start with a route that includes Holston Ridge Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Castle Ridge, and Elk Hill Way, which, as best I can tell, is off of Gap Road north-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| So you can book it through the transit app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| This will become effective with CAT reimagined on the 26th of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| but there will be a public hearing at the CAT meeting on July 25th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| Good to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| I know my colleagues are very aware of this, but there was a state law that was passed a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| that will have some profound effects to our elections in 2025,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and I just wanted to bring that up so we could maybe start a conversation about those changes to our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| for a couple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| One is that when I've been out in the community and talking to neighborhoods about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| and just people in general, I know we're all very familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| but a lot of folks, even though we spent a lot of time talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| weren't familiar with it, and they don't understand what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| And what we're going to end up seeing is because the state law overrules our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| the way we've been holding elections for the past 55 years will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| And that creates some challenges because, one, is that if you're thinking about running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| or you're just a voter looking at the charter trying to understand what our process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| you will read the charter and be thinking something that is one way when it won't be that way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| So it's going to be inconsistent in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| There's also going to be some redundancies with the way the district elections run now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| with the top two moving on out of a primary to at large with the entire city voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| which won't be possible anymore because of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| That will just be confusing to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| There's a really significant issue with the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| and I'll leave my colleague Councilmember Thomas to be able to talk about that in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| but there's particular issues with what will happen to the voters in the 5th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| because they're aligned with the mayor's race and with the other at large races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| So there are some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I think we should maybe take some time to talk about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| educate folks about what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and have some discussions about whether or not there may be some changes we need to make to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| and make sure that given that the state law is in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| how we react to it and make sure we're having the best election process we possibly can here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| which I think needs to maintain the ability for all of the councilmembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| to be accountable to all of the folks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| That's something I think we enjoy now, and I think it really helps us in our deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Anyway, I just think we should start having that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| and we can start having that tonight if you want to in the reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| or we can do something else with it, but I do think it's an important subject to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas, and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Yes, I would just underline everything my colleague said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Also, I do represent the 5th District, and as councilpeople know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| it's been a bit of an outlier to where the 5th District is not in the same election cycle with all the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=664)|
| 0:11:14| The effect of the legislation that comes out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| since the 5th District rep would not be running citywide in a runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| the voters in the 5th District would only go to the polls in city elections once every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| If you live any other place in the city, you would engage in a city election every two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| So this is something that definitely needs to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| It's obviously not fair to the voters in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| so I would just continue further discussion and trying to find a solution to remedy this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Vice-Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I was just going to piggyback on those comments, and I'm concerned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| This body has had a workshop before, but I'm willing to have another one if everybody agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| I don't know what the sequence of that looks like specifically in terms of what changes we have time to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| but if council is agreeable, I'm open to having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=738)|
| 0:12:29| Councilmember McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I just want to ask the law director what is within the power of the council as it relates to this topic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=753)|
| 0:12:41| Well, city council has the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| There might have to be a change to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| It obviously would have to be something that's permissible under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| but to change the charter, an ordinance would have to be put on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| and then ultimately it would go to the voters in the city to vote yes or no on the question presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=777)|
| 0:13:09| Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Councilmember Roberto, I appreciate you bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| From a different angle as an at-large representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| I think we ought to talk about all of it because many of us have said you run at-large in a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| and then you run at-large again in the general along with the mayor and the municipal judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| who can win in the primary with 50% plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| You can win with 70% in the primary as a city council member at-large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| and you still have to run again, which also is more expense and time and confusing to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| So I would very much support a workshop to talk about all those impacts in our election process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| that may have worked extremely well 55 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| but maybe there are unintended consequences that we should talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| I do think that this is an important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| I think in terms of priorities, I believe we have some items that we've prioritized before this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=859)|
| 0:14:34| and I think part of the reason why we need to think about when we have this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| is because I believe we've run out of time to change the charter this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| or at least to have a conversation and then pass an ordinance and get it on this year's ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| And to change the charter, we have to do that in an even-numbered year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| So I would just want us to keep that timeline in mind when thinking about a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| for beginning this conversation of what our new election system is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| But definitely we need announcements made coming from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and I think I've seen some already that talk about the city's decision not to continue challenging this legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| I think that clarity is needed in the public so citizens know that an ordinance is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| and a charter change is coming, but I don't believe we have time to do that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| and so that puts us two years out from when we can do a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Councilmember Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I would just agree that I think it's a good time to have this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| and I think a workshop is a good idea, so I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| And I think getting together as soon as possible to have that discussion I think would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| Councilmember Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| In for what? I'm not sure, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Oh, Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I was going to ask Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson for clarity on the timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| since that was one of the questions that were just raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| I haven't looked at them, but I think we have a former member of the Knox County Election Commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| who probably knows that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| I suppose that I'm getting called on for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Who am I asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Time has not run out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| We still have time to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| We do need to move quickly, but there is time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| In fact, if you look at the last time that a referendum went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| the last time I remember a referendum going to the voters from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| it was voted on in first reading at the end of July and second reading at the beginning of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| So there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| There's not a lot of time, but there's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I agree with that timeline that Councilmember Roberto shared, but as shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| I don't think we have time for discussion, just time to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And I think that we need time for a discussion because I've heard from my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| multiple changes that could be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| not just one change to our charter that could result from this new state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| but different ways that we can approach it, which I think are really smart ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and we need to spend some time discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| So that's why it's my opinion that we're out of time this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson, could one of you maybe tomorrow let us know what the timeline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| and whether it's possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Vice Mayor Smith, will you quickly ask us how quickly we can meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| If you will take that upon yourself to get something scheduled as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Oh, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| I just want to say, of course, normally we have workshops on the Thursdays following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and that would be a good day, I think, to at least explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| So maybe keep next Thursday open, as you always tend to do, just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Any other councilmember reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| I'll just make one more comment on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Yes, we could spend an extensive amount of time talking about all the changes we'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| and try and get in in the last minute when we're under the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| This is the only change that is being foist upon the voters of Knoxville against their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| The voters of Knoxville repeatedly told their representatives that they did not support these changes to their election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1159)|
| 0:19:29| and the representatives from the Knoxville delegation told us that they weren't going to pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| and they were going to pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| And then they let someone who did not represent Knoxville pass this upon the Knoxville voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| So this isn't about us who sit up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Because it's no skin off our back, we will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| But it's about the voters of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| They should be able to say whether they want to have something happen and change to the way that these elections are run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| because that's how it happened in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| So I believe it is our due diligence to act to change something if there's still time to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| and if other changes need greater discussion, those are not at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| Because this was made by someone who represents an area outside of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| And that is an injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Seeing no other lights on, we'll move on to Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Item 8A is a resolution reappointing Jack Neely to serve as the fifth district representative to the City of Knoxville Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1236)|

| 0:20:46| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1249)|

| 0:20:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| 8B is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville appointing Dusty Brock to the City of Knoxville Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1253)|

| 0:21:03| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1263)|

| 0:21:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| I was going to ask if Mr. Brock was here to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Mr. Brock, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Well, if you're watching, thank you for serving on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| He had mentioned attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Did we already vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| 9A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Section 2-450 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1289)|
| 0:21:39| to adjust the pay rates of professional stormwater engineers and recreation interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Seeing none, all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Oh, sorry, Council Member Ryder, it's a little harder to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| That's because I'm sitting behind everyone, but I'll not comment on the seating arrangement any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| Again, I just wanted to recognize Mr. Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| This is not germane to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Mr. Brock walked in after we called him, so we're on the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| But thank you for being willing to serve on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| You got appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you for noticing he was here, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Any other questions or comments on Item 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Yes, I just wanted to share an update that I did get an update from Parks and Rec about the pay for interns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1348)|
| 0:22:40| and it was indeed pay for interns and not for the summer workers that I had questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| One thing that was mentioned, and I did not speak with the mayor's office about this, so I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| but if possible, one thing that was mentioned in that correspondence was that the mayor's office is looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| doing some sort of study on how to address the pay of those summer workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| I was wondering if the mayor's office could speak to that any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Well, the mayor can speak to it, if that's who you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Yes, we're always studying our personnel and pay rates and trying to optimize pay and be a model employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| and so this is one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| We've done that for engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We've done that for the whole city, every single employee, and brought proposed increases as the budget allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| So, you know, our Parks and Rec staff would be part of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| In reviewing this item, what I did not understand was that there were employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1425)|
| 0:23:56| staff members who still are not at that $15 pay rate, but we have interns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| and with this amendment, all interns will be at that $15 pay rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| and that's what I have a concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| is that we have raised the pay rate of interns before we've raised the pay of some of our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1450)|
| 0:24:21| and I realize the money's in the budget, and this is a little bit of housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| but my preference would be as a policy, we as a city would prioritize the pay rate of all staff before we do that of interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| So I'm not able to support this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| 10-A is a resolution approving the appeal of R. Bentley Marlow of the Board of Zoning Appeals' denial of his request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1494)|

| 0:25:23| Just one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So you can have up to three speakers, and each of those three speakers can speak for up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| and then we can have a response from, I guess, three speakers, the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1531)|
| 0:25:42| Mr. Marlow, if you can start by saying your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1542)|

| 0:26:01| There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| There, it's on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| I think my iPad was blocking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Will, if you could pull up page 27 in the packet to put on the screen, if that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| We don't – I think all council members can access this stuff on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| We just want to keep this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So the issue here is a zoning ordinance interpretation, and it centers on accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1585)|
| 0:26:35| To catch everybody up, if people are at home not aware, Article 2.3 of our zoning ordinance defines accessory dwelling unit as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| quote, an additional dwelling unit located on the same lot width and is incidental to a principal single family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| An accessory dwelling unit may be attached or detached and must include separate cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| and sanitary facilities with its own means of ingress and egress, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Here the key is it must contain cooking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Now, I've looked all over our zoning code that many of you on this council approved back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Nobody defined cooking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| But the council then, and since then, repeatedly, whenever the codes are updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| adopts international codes, building codes, plumbing codes, electrical codes, mechanical codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| And so if we look to these building codes, we find that nowhere in there do they define cooking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| But they come close and they give us some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| So if we look at the IRC, the International Residential Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| it defines a kitchen in Section 306.2 as each dwelling unit shall be provided with a kitchen area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| and every kitchen area shall be provided with a sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| The electrical code defines a kitchen as, quote, an area with a sink and permanent provisions for food preparation and cooking, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| The plumbing code at Section 804 says simply, kitchens shall comply with Section 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| But the plumbing code gives us some useful illustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| And in all those illustrations, we see two things are in every one of these illustrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| a range or a cooktop and a workspace directly next to a sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| So if you look at the drawing that was submitted in this project, page 27 of the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| you'll see that there is no workspace, there is no range or cooktop, there is no kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| So how then and why then did Mr. Ahrens determine that this is a dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| calling it specifically an ADU when there are no cooking facilities contemplated on the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| there are no cooking facilities in the scope of my contract for the homeowner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| It's completely baffling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| It seems like it's just Mr. Ahrens has made a decision that he doesn't want this structure to be used in really any meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1734)|
| 0:29:04| And what's even more ironic is that this structure is actually a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| We've learned that Mr. Ahrens did not tell the homeowner when she first tried to do this by herself before I got involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| and they certainly didn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| But this home has been there, this building has been there since 1917 Sanborn Mount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| and it's over in the East Tennessee Historical McClung Library in the city directory back to 1948 as a separate stand-alone house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1766)|
| 0:29:38| Why did Mr. Ahrens not tell the homeowner that or tell me that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| In fact, we first got tipped off about this after the BZA meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and we found that in the city and Mr. Ahrens' department's own records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| the city determined in 1998 that this was a single family home, referencing the city directory from 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| So this entire six-month ordeal and all these thousands of dollars the homeowner has paid has been for naught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| She ought to be able to restore that single family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| which certainly should be allowed to have a kitchen and cooking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Here we are, and we're in the midst of a housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| and we have an administration that claims on one hand to be focused on housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and yet we have an administrator who seems to be trying his damnedest to administratively destroy a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you. The next person signed up to speak in favor of this appeal is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Mr. Bartholomew, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you. Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge Lane, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Spoken many times on the challenges that our zoning code creates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| and this is yet another example of the labyrinth that we've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| The level of complexity is overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| This is a homeowner that tried to pull a permit on her own, and she wanted to renovate the building for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| She was given the wrong direction from the planning department and given the runaround for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| They've now interpreted that what she wanted to do is an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| While I disagree that their interpretation that having a 50-amp plug makes something an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| and I want you all to think about the impact that that has on a garage with an electric vehicle in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| While I disagree with their interpretation, and I think it's a dangerous precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| I want to highlight what would happen if this was an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Ms. Wolfe pays about $1,400 a year in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| If we're able to count three dwelling units on this site, which has had three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| as Mr. Marlow pointed out, since 1948, that each dwelling unit would pay $400 a year in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| The very next agenda item that we're going to be discussing has a pilot that will total $100 a year per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1912)|
| 0:32:01| Her unit would be ready for occupancy in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| The next agenda item is over 30 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Her unit will cost under $100,000 to build, and the next agenda item is $280,000 per unit to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Let me say for the record that I support the next item very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I think we should actually use Mr. Goss for all of our affordable housing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| because he's been able to provide a build cost that's $140,000 under the most recent ones that we've actually approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| He's being a good steward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Back to 2448 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| A dwelling unit there, if allowed, would provide housing sooner, at less cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| and generate more in tax revenue than your latest and greatest corridor development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| The amount of effort going into reducing our housing supply is nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| We have a shortage of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Build cost is higher than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Rental rates are the highest ever, and we choose to remove dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Why are we removing dwelling units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| This is not a hypothetical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| This is what the city council has created through our decision on ADUs, recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| our current zoning laws that we are reducing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| This does not require a pilot, a TIF, affordable housing tax credits, or LIHTC funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| I alluded to this before, and so did Mr. Marlow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| but this property is on the agenda next week at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| and then probably back here at city council next month for another interpretation discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| This unit was considered a single-family residential dwelling for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| Why the building and planning department never mentioned this to the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| or never brought it up at BZA, I don't know, but it is going to be a topic for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| The city and planning department likes to talk about what walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Well, this does walk like a duck and quack like a duck, and maybe it's an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| but it also walks and quacks like a workshop, and that's what was presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| Their interpretation is all something that they've come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| but 100 percent of the plans that were provided shows a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| This interpretation is dangerous for the city, and I'm asking that you not let it stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Do we really want to bring the use permit that I'm sure every single one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| have had constituents mention to you into our residential housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| I don't think we need to, and I think it's very dangerous for the city to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Mr. Frost had a question for Mr. Bartholomew, if you would stay for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I'm trying to seek some clarification from your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| What's being appealed is Mr. Aron's determination that this would become an ADU, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| But you talked about there would be three units at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| including this property, this building to the rear, that would be an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| We don't think it is an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| What's being appealed is the ruling at BZA that for an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| for something to be considered an ADU, it doesn't have to have cooking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| What was argued at BZA was that a 50-amp plug and a bathroom determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| made it a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| I was just a little confused because of what Mr. Aron's has determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| and you talked about three units on this parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| This house is a single-family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| The front house is a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| This appeal, though, is about an accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| and his ruling and the determination at BZA that an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| is considered an accessory dwelling unit with a 50-amp plug and a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| That's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| since this is an appeal of the interpretation of the zoning administrator's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| understanding of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I will call upon Peter Arons, the zoning administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| to provide his explanation of how he's interpreted the code as to the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| Mr. Marlow has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Mr. Arons, you're recognized to speak for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Peter Arons, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| This is an extension of a conversation we started weeks ago about enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| with ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| And so this is a scenario where, and this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| I'll read the email that I sent to Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| It's more than just a receptacle and a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| That's a small portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I'll read what I sent Mr. Marlow on February 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I made the call that a fully insulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| meaning an accessory structure that's insulated like a house with wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| insulation, R30 insulation in the attic space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| and conditioned, so it's got HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| with a full bathroom and two 20-amp circuits near a sink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| as required for a kitchen counter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| a 30-amp circuit as required for a clothes dryer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| and a 50-amp circuit as required for a stove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| does not resemble a non-habitable structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| The proposal has all the components of an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| You have the right to appeal this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Jen Scobie is there to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So it's not one or two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| It's the combination of all the parts together resemble all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| residential code requirements for a dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| We can talk about houses and housing at another time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| but that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| It has all the parts of a house, and so we called it a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| And in this form, it's an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| which is not permitted with a duplex per the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| So I'm all about increasing the housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I just think that we have regulations for a purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| and we try and enforce those clearly and equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| But I feel like we've done what we said we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| When we recognize items that look like a house, we would call it a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Sorry, Mr. Marlow, you have up to a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So my rebuttal is that there's nowhere in our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| or the building code that says that you can't insulate an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| It doesn't say anywhere in our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| nor our building codes that we've adopted that you can't have 20, 30, 40, 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| 100, 150 amp plugs in these accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So there's no provision in our zoning code that this council adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| or the building codes that this council has adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| that says that if you combine this, you magically create a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| The magic is in a cooking facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| and nobody has taken the time to fully define a cooking facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| or somewhere else in our zoning code it says provisions for cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| But if you look at the drawing, we have no kitchen drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| I would dare say, I challenge Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| that if I was to submit that drawing and call it a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| I don't think it would survive Plans Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| because he would want a detail of the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| So he's trying to have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| He's trying to say, well, you've got to have a kitchen drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| if you're going to call it a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| And he said this, if you read the minutes from the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| it was the first go, the first month that it went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| the month that it was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| If you read those minutes, Mr. Ahrens said specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| when asked by the members of BZA what we would have to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| and he simply said remove the 50-amp plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| So this turns the interpretation, if you allow this to stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| any accessory structure that has a 50-amp plug can be viewed as an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| So that would mean that if you have a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| and you want to have an electric vehicle charger, you've created an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| I think it's preposterous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Council member, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Mr. Swanson, when, I believe you're the right one to call upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| when something isn't determined and defined within our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| I believe there's a section in the zoning code that specifies zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| interpretation and it specifies that Mr. Ahrens' position is that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| So, Mr. Marlowe, no offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| but you keep referring to a garage and an outlet that's 50-amp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| converting a garage to an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| But I believe that part of Mr. Ahrens' interpretation here is the insulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| to code for both walls and roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| You've met the code for a dwelling unit in every way except for a cooktop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2488)|
| 0:41:37| And because, as you stated yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| it's not defined in our code what a kitchen unit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Mr. Swanson has just very clearly stated that our code leaves that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| interpretation up to Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Mr. Ahrens, may I please call you up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| With all of the things that are in the plans that have been submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| someone could come then afterwards and put a cooktop in it because it has all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| the capacity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| When you have a 50-amp circuit installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| it's just a matter of going to a local store, buying a stove, plugging it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| No permit is required for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| The other thing that I would say is I'm not going to call out names anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| There was support for missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| and missing middle housing very specifically included duplexes not allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| And so now it's you pass this code but ignore that code because we're just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| going to put a cooktop in this or we're going to call it something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And I feel like that's what we're being asked to do is to overlook what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| If we find over time that we want to edit or modify missing middle housing or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| aspect of the code to allow an ADU with a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| then that's where the change needs to lie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| not in trying to decide whether something's a giraffe or a zebra or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| elephant or a rhino.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| It is completely habitable with all of the insulation to code for habitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| and all of the components needed to support cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| So I'm sorry, I cannot support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| It was filed to BZA with the hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| and I do not see the hardship and support the 4-0 finding of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2627)|
| 0:43:58| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Ms. Ahrens, would you come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| I understand some of the parts perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I think that's a wise way to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| It makes sense to me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| each individual aspect of this could make a case for one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| but I think you're looking at the sum of the parts together and what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| looks like all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I think you briefly may have answered the question I was going to ask next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| which is, is there a requirement for them to disclose cooking now if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| were an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| In other words, could they get approved for this and go back and go later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| install the cooking, and would the city know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| cooking unit or cooking structure, and would the city know somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| And if they did find out, what would be their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| is there any cause for revoking a permit or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| At that point, the permit would be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| and a certificate of occupancy issued for an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| If we found them to be out of compliance with the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| we would address it like we do every other zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Which is, in that circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| they installed a cooking structure after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| If we find that somebody is utilizing that as an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| then we would notify the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| we would tell them they need to remove the ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| and we would proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| This is a little challenging for me in the sense that this is before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| BZA as a workshop, so I'm trying to kind of transform my mind now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| consider an ADU because the applicant originally said this was for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| So on the cooking part, how would you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| it seems like there's a lack of clarity around cooking and the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| at least explicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Could you expound upon how you're thinking about that as the one missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| link to clarity on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I don't have the code in front of me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| but I believe it was permanent facilities for cooking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| which is a permanent stove that you plug in versus a microwave that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| set on the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| And so I think things got a little confusing with this whole cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| business and the 50-amp circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| That was our effort to try and help them say, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| if you don't have permanent provisions for cooking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| which is your 50-amp circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| then you don't have all of the components needed for a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| You take one of them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| It doesn't matter to me which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| That one just seemed to be the easiest one to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| And so we tried to do that for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| With the inclusion of a cooking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| would you then say that this meets all the requirements for an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I know that's your general decision, but is it a permittable decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Meaning, I think you're generally saying this looks like an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| It's got all the pieces and parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| but did it technically meet all the requirements for an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| enough to be permitted if it were so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Or you haven't looked at it that way and therefore you're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| It has all of the parts that are required to be permitted to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| So this is our last chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And so that's why I feel like I'm in alignment with city council in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| here's all the permanent structural items that are going to be under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| All the other stuff can be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Permits are not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| So it's not like we have another bite at the apple to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| what they're doing in that structure is permitted by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Council Member Hensley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I'm on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Council Member McKenzie and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| So, Mr. Ahrens, please correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So a workshop can have insulation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| A workshop can have a bathroom, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| A workshop can have a sink, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| A workshop can have two 20-amp circuits, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| But the issue that you have, according to the code, is the 50-amp circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| It's the combination of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| The combination of all of those things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So if the 50-amp circuit had not been included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| We would have issued the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Much like if the bathroom were not included, we would issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| So I'm kind of following you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Now I'd like to ask Mr. Marlowe a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you for being here, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| So would you be in agreement to remove the 50-amp circuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| Is it necessary for the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Well, the 50-amp circuit is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| So there's no reason to remove it in our eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| But now that we've done more research, we now believe this is a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| And I've appealed this personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| I'm not representing the owner in this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I appealed this personally because I believe this is going to set a bad precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| or potentially could have unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| And I'll probably see you guys in the future because I believe that if this is upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| then I'm going to have plans that Mr. Aarons is going to have issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| where I'm going to rely on his interpretation, as he's outlined it right here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| that in a different project I think he's going to have an issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| So I'm here because, honestly, I think in the best interest of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| as someone who is very knowledgeable in our zoning code, been here through lots of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| I've spent a lot amount of my own personal money trying to modify and improve our zoning codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| I think this is a bad precedent that it can be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| If you don't want, the proper way to fix this is to overhaul our definition of ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| Because our zoning definition of an ADU, our prohibition in Article 10 simply says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| no accessory dwelling or no accessory structure can have a cooking facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| That's all we say, but we never define cooking facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| And then we've adopted the building code, the plumbing code, the electrical code, the mechanical code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| None of them define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| But they all talk about a kitchen and they show drawings of kitchens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| and they show our stoves and cooktops and workspace, which is countertops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| None of which this has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| So if we really want to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| I think the way to address it is properly define what cooking facilities are in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| But that's laborious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Doing it piecemeal like this, I think, creates a possibility for unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Because if I was to turn this drawing in and say I'm building this as a single family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| I'm almost positive that Mr. Aaron's department would deny my plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| and require that I draw out the kitchen with countertops, cabinet space, a stove or a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| He would require that of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| So it's like if it's good enough to call it a cooking facility in the terms of an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| why is the same drawing not good enough to call it a fully functional house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| if it was to be designed and built as a standalone house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Or if he is consistent and he says, you know what, this is all that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| Merely have a sink and a 50-amp plug and a fully insulated air-conditioned building and we'll call it a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Well, shoot, that's a win for me and every other developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| because I'll start building houses with no cabinets and no stoves and no refrigerators, just plugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| So I can save a whole lot of money and claim I've built a whole lot of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| But how functional is that housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| I mean, that's the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| One of the members of the BZA is an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| She raised the issue at the first go-around that she regularly designs garages, detached and attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| that have laundry facilities, bathrooms, and refrigerators in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| And many of her clients are putting 50- and 60-amp plugs to charge their electric vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| That means that every garage she's designing could potentially be deemed an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| And so that makes the code very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| And what Mr. Ahrens determines, well, this garage with this 50-amp plug and this bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| and what pick a neighborhood where that's probably the norm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Sequoia Hills, Mr. Roberto's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Well, that's not an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| That's just somebody needing to plug in their Tesla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| But if we stick it over in my neighborhood, Mechanicsville, Ms. McKenzie's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| oh, that's old Bentley trying to squeeze out an extra dwelling in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| It's the same bits and pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| It's the same parts put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| My time is about up, and I want Mr. Ahrens to come back really, really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| Mr. Ahrens, could you speak to us on what's on that property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| that this particular work shed that's before us is located on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| I think we heard that there's a duplex there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| There is a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| There is a duplex, and there is a structure that we determined the use was abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| because the electricity was removed voluntarily for more than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| And by the zoning code, that means the use was abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| The zoning code also says that any time you reestablish a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| the next use has to be compliant with this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Previous code, pre-recode, garage apartments were permitted in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| So I believe that's what it was, is a garage apartment, which is a type of a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| And so I don't disagree that it was a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| At some point, I didn't live there, I don't know what took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| but I know that the use was abandoned by somebody willingly removing the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| And so it's my job to make sure that the next use is compliant with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| We'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Well, I wanted to clarify the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| What is before us is an appeal of the zoning administrator's determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| So there's no hardship argument as a part of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| And I did have a question for Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| As I was trying to understand this issue better, I thought, well, what if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| aren't there any ovens, cooking structures that could be operated without that 50 amp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3286)|
| 0:54:57| I'm trying to determine how you made that determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| that that was kind of the threshold versus, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| getting a lower powered oven to put in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I'm not sure they make lower powered ovens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| The standard is 50 amp if it's electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| If it's gas, then it's lower, but it has a gas line to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Yeah, I did do a quick search and I couldn't find lower ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| but those could have been gas ovens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Okay, well, that's helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| because my concern with this determination is how to ensure it's not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3328)|
| 0:55:37| arbitrary determination, right, because it's creating a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| I do believe that, as was pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| I think having clear definitions in the code is what is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| But without that, the code states that when there isn't that clarity in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| code, we look to our zoning administration to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| And I imagine there are multiple sections of that code that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| expounded upon, and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| But I am struck, regardless of the ramifications of this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| because counsel can always move forward with an ordinance following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| I believe at this point a determination was made as allowed by code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| and it does not seem to be an arbitrary determination that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you, Counsel Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Mr. Ahrens, this is just a question because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| I'm not an expert on amps for all appliances in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| but I know people who do woodworking, and those machines take a lot of voltage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| Is there anything other than cooking and plugging up a Tesla that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| require a 50 amp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| I mean, I'm just asking because there are people who have insulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| woodshops with refrigerators and countertops, and I'm just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| just asking because, you know, does woodshop equipment require that much amp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| I'm sure there are pieces of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| We make determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| I'm not arguing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I'm just curious because I didn't know if the only thing that could require a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| 50 amp was related to cooking or Tesla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| but there may be machinery that people use in shops that might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Counsel Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Mr. Ahrens, in the accessory structures part of our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| how many accessory structures can there be on a property, like sheds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| Is it a certain number, or is it based on square footage coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| I believe it's based on square footage coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| You've got a maximum per structure and then a maximum combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| So if I have to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| If I have a house with enough yard or a small enough house on a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| depending on what my zone says for coverage, I could have one structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| maybe another structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Could I possibly even have a third if I'm still under coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| So I'm looking at 10-3 general regulations for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3523)|
| 0:59:14| If my lot area in the table says 15,000 square foot or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| maximum building coverage for a single accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| 750 square foot or the building coverage of the primary structure, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| And then there's a maximum amount of square footage that I can cover on my lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| So I could have multiple structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| And I could insulate them all and build them all with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| as long as I don't put a cooking thing, they can all be habitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| As long as I have certain ambit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I'm just trying to, I feel like that's what Mr. Marlow is getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| is that this is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| He keeps arguing it's a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Isn't that his argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| That he's wrong and this is a workshop because he doesn't have cooking facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| So the code allows me to have multiple workshops on my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| depending on how much lot I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| And as long as I don't put a cooktop in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| I can have multiples of them behind my duplex or my house, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| As long as I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| As long as they are not accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Council Member McKenzie and then Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| So, Mr. Ahrens, if the amp, 50 amp circuit were removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3642)|
| 1:00:51| this would no longer be classified or considered as an accessory dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| What's been on my mind during this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| is visiting with somebody a couple of days ago last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| that I went to elementary school with, high school with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| who now lives in a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| I don't think he has a 50 amp in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| but he does have an extension cord, which he is using to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| This is where he lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| This is where his life is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| That feels a bit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| I want to respect that the final decision has to fall with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| and that it falls with you, but it still feels quite...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Like there's not a checklist that you're kind of using common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| saying, well, if there's this, this, and this, it looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| But if they're saying it's not that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| shouldn't we start with where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| My point in the shed thing is we could turn anything into an accessory dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| when we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I think you've heard throughout tonight that there's been a lot of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| about this actually being a dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And so my staff, when they were reviewing and interacting with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| they got the same sense that it was going to be a dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| And that's when things escalated is when we turned them down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| because you can't have that accessory dwelling behind a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And so we have to use...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| We have to justify uses every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| We have to evaluate what people are doing, how they're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| and see if it aligns with what's presented to us on the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| This is one where my staff said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| it looks like it's an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| It seems like that's where they're wanting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| And so I supported staff and said, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| There's an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| But that's where, again, like I had said months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| if we see all the pieces put together, because at that point there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| conversation about how do we prevent people from just establishing ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| And so that's when I made the commitment to if we see all the pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| we're going to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| And it looks like an ADU, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| It just also feels like you're trying to look at their intention when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| they're saying something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| Sometimes what they say changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Council Member Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Ever since I've been on council with the ADU issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| which has been kind of looming large since I've been here anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| all I hear is how hard it is to know where they are and to keep track of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| them, and nobody ever knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| So if you don't call an ADU something that looks like an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| then everybody just starts getting permits for stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And then as soon as Peter's not looking or his people aren't looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| then they turn it into an ADU and somebody moves into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| And then they say, we can't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| We don't know that they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Is that true, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| If they're not permitted, we can't track them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| Once you close that out, though, and say somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| well, we don't have a cooktop in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Then our tracking happens by either observation out in the field or by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| You all are trying to create some consistent system that all things can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| kind of be weighed against and prevent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| disparate illegal structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| And so I can appreciate that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| On the other side of that, remind me again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I didn't get clarity on it last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| what would happen if you went out six months from now and there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| cooking facility there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| We would notify the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| If there were all the pieces of an ADU and we made an observation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| agreed that it was an accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| then we would determine that that was not a legal accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and we would notify the owner and we would work with them to see how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| could remove something to make it a non-habitable structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| And could you pull, you know, revoke a certificate of occupancy or if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| refused and you just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| But the CO is not for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| The CO would be for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| But there would be some penalty that eventually would not allow them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| use a structure as an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| You know, I just want to make a plug for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| we do rely on you and your expertise to make these administrative decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| where there's lack of clarity or there's intention that's unclear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| and we do rely on you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| I do know also that the CO can never be detailed enough to create a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| line of sight for every circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| With that said, I've mentioned you to this before, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| some of these administrative rules would be helpful to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| archived or written somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| And I know you could probably say, well, if you come to our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| we'll kind of read that historical decision-making into our advice back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| you, Mr. or Mrs. Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| But the fact that there are no administrative rules publicly available for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| well-intended applicant means that they don't know what precedent there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| When you say administrative rules, are you talking about policy determinations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| Yeah, where there's gray or where there's this circumstance where if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| five parts or more or less, they don't have to have rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| It's impossible to have a rule for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| But it is possible to have publicly available the administrative decisions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| these gray areas so that a well-intended applicant can look ahead and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| ah, they decided that there two years ago when it had to do with cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| facility, I better tread lightly or I better not install a 50-watt amp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So the lack of publicly available administrative rules in these gray areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| I understand it creates liability and there are other reasons you're about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| tell me why that's not a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| No, it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Well, then let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| We have policy determinations on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| but they're not for the onesie-twosies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| For instance, it's window openings on lot lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| which is something we deal with all the time downtown with the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| So there are administrative decisions you've made that are publicly available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| that aren't necessarily clearly spelled out in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| but they are publicly available in your perspective on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| But it's for items that come back to us and our staff is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| hey, we need to make a policy on this so that everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Where are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I can send you the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| And I'm thinking of a lot of Fort Sanders circumstances that I might look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| for on there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Director Ahrens, there's been a lot of discussion about the 50-amp plug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| but what I'm hearing from you, if I'm correct, is it's not the plug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| it's the totality of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| You may have given the simplest solution of if you remove the plug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| then you're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| But would the same be true that if they removed any of those things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| added up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| So is this a piecemeal approach that you've laid out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4128)|
| 1:08:57| That's what was said in the rebuttal was this is a piecemeal approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| I don't know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| I'm not sure what it means either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| but I'm not sure that it is because I think what you've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| if I've got the rule right, what you're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| if the totality of the situation looks like a dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| then we're going to call it a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| And your staff, did they physically go to this location and walk through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| They didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| So how do you know what you get the plans and you're reviewing the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| We reviewed the plans because what's there now is not what's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| We review what's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| That's what we're issuing permits for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| And in their discussions with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| did they get an impression about what this use was going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| I hate to speak for them, but I'm going to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| And so they're doing what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| You are asked to make difficult determinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| and you're making a determination here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| BZA reviewed it and denied the appeal, and now it's here before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| Just looking at the totality of everything that went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| this looks to me like it was very thoroughly reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| that you have a well-defined rule, and I don't support the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| but I do support your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So that's how I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Just a reminder to council, there's currently not a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| so we'll be happy to entertain one when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Council Member Fugate and then McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| And I really don't mean to beat a dead horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| but I'm a little confused because I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| I understand not wanting that if it looks like a duck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| acts like a duck, it probably is a duck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| and that's what your determination is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| My question would be if someone could come and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| I'm building a workshop and have all these components in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I mean, if you do woodworking, you work on cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| and you have a lift in your garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| and you have a bathroom in your garage or a sink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| you can have all those things and other things that at a later date could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| probably convert it into an ADU, but at the time somebody's building it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| they're telling you that's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| That's the only thing that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| I understand why you made your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| and it has to be your decision to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| but I worry about the fact that there are other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Let's put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| If it were, I hate for people to think if they're building a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| that it could become viewed as an ADU, and then what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| Because if that isn't what they intended it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and it's a single family home on it, and it really is just a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| when they move, I guess somebody could make it an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Staff makes judgment calls every day based on the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Obviously, if you're going to do a workshop and you need a welder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| and you're going to be working on cars, there's going to be a garage door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| We look at everything in its totality and make those judgment calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| That's kind of what I needed to hear, that it's not just those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| but if there's only one way in and it's a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| and you're going to be doing those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| that might be the tip that helps you with your determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| I just want to maybe wrap up this conversation with just for Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| I just want to take this opportunity to first thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| because I know that you have put a lot of blood, sweat and tears and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| into really being intentional about providing affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| the Mechanicsville area specifically, and for that I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| and I applaud your efforts and all that you do and you continue to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| to help make the community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| So I don't ever want you to think that that is not appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| or goes unnoticed, especially by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| This is not an easy decision, in a sense, to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| I think that I've absolutely learned a lot today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| but at the end of the day I actually have to go along with what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| procedure and our rules are, which leads it to the interpretation of codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| and so I will not be able to support it, but I wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Apparently I've learned if I get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| it's because it's not an easy case, and I just brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Like I said, I'm not even representing the homeowner in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I'm doing this on my own because I believe it's appropriate to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Peter's decision, and I believe in this case it should be appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| but I believe that doing so also places the onus back on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| I believe you guys need to get into this ADU stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| and we need better definitions in our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| and I understand how difficult that is and how controversial that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| but that's what it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| We're going to have multiple skirmishes like this over the foreseeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| future while housing is a scarce commodity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| and everyone's trying to find a way to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| and to be fair, less scrupulous people would have simply stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| said that they would take out the 50-amp plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| I've had professional architects that watched the BZA with some interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and said stick conduit in the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| They can't disapprove conduit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Get your permit, remove the 50-amp plug, but run the conduit in the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Get your CO, run a string down that conduit, pull your wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| You're back where you want to be, and we wouldn't have wasted six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| I'm trying to do this legitimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| I'm trying to show the dysfunction in the department, in our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| and I'm trying to bring it to you guys with a bow on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| to say, hey, please fix this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4526)|

| 1:15:32| This was $130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Okay, does the council member want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| I'll make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Okay, motion has been made to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4547)|

| 1:16:40| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| I just have one question, either somebody in the administration or the applicant or Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| What percentage of the ground floor will be retail or transparent glass or retail oriented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| Mr. Bentley or is Mr. Goss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Mr. Goss, you're probably in the best position to answer that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| If you could please come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I'm Buzz Goss, 110 West Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I also reside at 300 State Street right next to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Councilman Smith, to answer your question, we develop marble alley lofts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| and one of the things that we worked out with the design review committee at the time was that the ground floors would be mostly transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4641)|
| 1:17:29| although there wasn't really much market for retail or commercial at the time, but they can always be converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| In this case, we're putting all of our retail and, of course, the access, the lobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| and those kinds of things at the corner of Union and State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I guess that probably takes up about 25% of that long facade there along State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| and then we have a series of like walk-up townhome style units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| But, again, they'll have lots of glass there on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| I'm sure Mr. Aaron's back there will keep me in line on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| But then we also have some office suites that can be leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| So most of the ground floor will be residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| It'll all be rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Residential, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Residential, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Most of the ground floor will be residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| We also have entrance into the garage, so I'd say about 25% is entrance to the garage, 25% is the retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| and then 50% in the middle is the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Yes, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| That space there has been underutilized for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| It's just been a parking lot, and I've been wanting something to happen on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| And I like the sound of your plan, the combination of housing, retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| You know, I think that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Make a little comment on your building on Marble Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I know that you kept the option open at some time to maybe have some retail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| And we'll see how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| But I appreciate that you, you know, kind of left that as a possible future option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| So I'll be voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4755)|

| 1:20:21| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Yes, just some comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| This is, of course, a very good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| It kind of follows in a way what we just saw out on Kingston Pike with that combination of revamping pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| access and sidewalks, and it shows how we can do things in a very busy section and make them safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4835)|
| 1:20:44| I've described this area times before as brutally anti-pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| And just to kind of quote a little bit from the report, this segment of roadway has been identified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4852)|
| 1:21:01| City of Knoxville Vision Zero Action Plan as Tier 1 High Injury Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| the highest priority rating for a segment needing safety improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| In the last three years, there's been 48 crashes reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Couple the high crash rate with the volume and the 40-mile-an-hour speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| and you have a very hostile environment for people walking or bicycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| Mr. Clabo, I couldn't set it myself better, so I just read what you wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| But we're excited, of course, about this, and I'll be supporting it, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4897)|

| 1:22:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Can somebody speak to why we want this back and what we think it might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| I know we don't have any particular plans, but why the city might want to be buying this back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| Well, we have this unique opportunity, and we can decide later how we'd want to dispose of it or develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4979)|
| 1:23:09| And so that's the main reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| It's sort of unique that this happened and that we have this opportunity come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| And so we don't know what we want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| A lot of people probably have some thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| but I will say that if council approves this tonight, before we do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| it would come before council and we'd welcome your input and ideas on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| So we're just taking the opportunity to get it, and then we will do a planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| kind of think about it in the administration about what we might want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| I mean, for $268,000, I mean, like, it's not that big of an amount for that level of property in that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5021)|
| 1:23:52| So it would seem worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| I just know a lot of people will be like, well, what are you going to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| And so the public answer is we have no decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| But it is too good an opportunity to let it pass us by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Is that basically the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Just out of curiosity, the funds to cover this purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| is it coming from the $900,000 in the budget to acquire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| or is this separate from that initiative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Mr. DuBose, our Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development, could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| Yes, Kevin DuBose, Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| No, it's not coming from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Reprogrammed money for acquisition is coming from another general fund source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Oh, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Yeah, I don't know if this is your question to answer or Ms. Ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| but just for the record, maybe a note about the history of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| It used to belong to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Yeah, I'll let Ms. Ball give a brief overview of the history of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| It's pretty interesting and long, and we're back where we started from in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| I think for the record, that's an important part of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| We have a whole packet on the history, thanks to Mr. DuBose, which we're happy to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| Brief history on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Actually, Kevin, do you want to do a history on this property since you did this research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| The property is rather noteworthy, particularly to African-American history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| Knoxville was without a hospital for African-Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| Citizens who were African-American could only access the basement of Knoxville General Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| and this structure was built in 1926 or 1927, I believe, and it became the place for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5165)|
| 1:26:21| for a large segment of this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| A lot of notables, including some family members, and Bob Booker wrote about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| and Bob was born there in that hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| There it operated until it closed, and then it was transferred to create the Serene Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5192)|
| 1:26:41| but there was a reversionary clause that allowed us to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| What year did the city sell it for Serene Manor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| It was in the 1980s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| The city transferred the Rosenwald Wing to Serene Manor, which operated it as a nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| until very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| I also think it's interesting to note that hospitals and medical things, among many other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| were completely segregated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Even when UT Hospital opened in 1956, that's when Knoxville General Hospital closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| but it was still segregated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| There were 60 beds for black patients at UT Hospital, but completely segregated until 1963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| Also, just as a literary note, the Knoxville General Hospital is featured in Sutry, the novel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| That's how I knew about its history before I read further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| That cultural center has extensive history about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| Again, Mr. Booker wrote about it, and there's a lot of history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Well, I hope that whatever happens with it in the future, that I think there's an opportunity to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| that we document that history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| I know these processes take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| There is a possibility I won't even be on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| so for those of you who will still be here, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| and those here in the administration will make sure that those things are noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| I would also like to point out that these are also, as the conversation moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| Serene Manor, as well as, and I apologize, I do not remember the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| even though I used to go there and visit my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| My immediate neighbor, who was born in my house, was a resident at the place next to where Yeehaw is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5307)|
| 1:28:35| Renaissance Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Renaissance Terrace, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| Senior Citizens Home Assistance Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| So I want to point out to everyone that those are both facilities where we've lost senior beds in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5322)|
| 1:28:52| And so just for those of us, you know, I'm right now dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| and a lot of us are at an age point where we're dealing with finding housing for our own parents or for family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| or we're watching our friends go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| And note that both of these, no fault of the cities, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| is just the state of health care in the United States right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| that people are living longer and we are very challenged by people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| where they're going to live and how they're going to get care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| And so I just want to publicly make the point to point out that this is just one more facility where we've lost beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| for that population that continues to grow and is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| And so, anyway, just want to make that part of the record, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| We have a motion on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| and accept the 2024 Law Enforcement Crime Gun Intelligence Center Interrogation Initiative Program grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5405)|
| 1:30:14| from the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance in the amount of $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| with no required local match for funding of the Knoxville Police Department's Forensic Unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| to enhance gun crime investigations and prosecutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Chief Noel, if you could briefly, for those who are watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| just give us an overview of what this technology would be if we were awarded this grant, what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5439)|
| 1:30:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| I want to be clear that applying for this grant for us is going to be a reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| We've applied for this grant for the last two years and not been awarded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| There's only 25 crime gun intelligence centers across the whole United States, very, very competitive grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| But we believe that we have a pretty strong grant application for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| And what this is is this program helps us to more quickly identify leads on firearms that we use in violent crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| not only identify the shell casings but bullet fragments when we have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| and get those entered in the database and coordinate with regional law enforcement agencies as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| to be able to identify those leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| And the goal is to be able to more quickly identify shooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| and bring them into custody by working with the ATF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| And, Chief Noel, is it correct stated here that we would also have funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| to hire a National Integrated Ballistics Information Network technician?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| If we were awarded this grant, we would hire another ballistic analyst and a technician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| And so this is really more about forensics, also some training, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| to be able to more readily identify and be able to link different crimes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| Yes, this is forensic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| This is microscopes, looking through microscopes at bullets and shell casings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| to try to connect violent individuals to murders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5543)|

| 1:35:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| I know that we've discussed this project previously, but not in terms of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| And so I was wondering if anyone's here who could speak to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| Mr. Bentley from KCDC is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| If you could speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I'm not sure if the applicant's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| So apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| It's a party to the applicant or the development, but we purchased some of the parcels at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| site, and the applicant had a baby within the last couple of days, and so he's at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| tending to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| But yeah, this is simply cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| There were some TDOT right-of-ways as well as some parcels with multiple in the teens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| heirs in the midst of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And so we had to get clear title and TDOT right-of-way acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| All of that had to occur before a rezoning could take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| So this is just looking, instead of coming to you all piecemeal, looking at the totality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| And the rezoning is requested because of the intended use of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5786)|
| 1:36:35| Our zoning code requires this zoning for that facility to move into that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| Is that the reason for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Maybe Director Brooks, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| This did pass unanimously on consent for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| So could you explain why they're seeking this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Amy Brooks, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| I don't want to speak for the applicant about why they're requesting it and their specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| When planning staff and the Planning Commission look at a rezoning, we look at all the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| uses on a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| But applicants will look at the zoning code and request a specific zone that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| will accommodate their specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| So I don't know if someone's here to speak to that specifically, and then I can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| some additional context if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| And one bit of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| We do know, based on the previous pilot approval, what the proposed project for the site is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| So that has come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| So we have clarity around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| It's sort of just to make it easy for people listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| It's a Topgolf-type concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| So entertainment venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| It's got some other games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| It's very family-style oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I know that it's a local developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| And so it's going to be more connected to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And there's a goal around this site to really be able to bring people that live in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| and in the neighborhoods to this site for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| I did receive some concerning questions about the walkability of this area and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| city's plan is long-term for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| My assumption would be, based on its location, that it would be a part of the city's walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5889)|
| 1:38:19| goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| I will say I love the fact that the connection of the greenway right there on that road has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| just been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| So if you drive by the site, and does anybody know the name of that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| It's like a service road next to I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| I'll just point out, Ms. Parker, that like so many things, the city took the lead on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| And we improved the infrastructure along that area, including adding a connecting greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| So the walkability part is paramount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| And that's why we think one reason that this is someplace that used to be an industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| wasteland that somebody's investing and turning it into a business where hopefully people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| will walk from nearby neighborhoods, or if they take the bus or bike, there are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| than one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| There will certainly be people, hopefully, who drive their personal cars there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| But we hope it can support multimodal safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| But a lot of that infrastructure has already been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| My concern is that this would lead to further rezoning along 5th Avenue to highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5955)|
| 1:39:25| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| I think that the walkability of this area is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| And so I think it's important that we discuss what the intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| I even would wonder if this lines up at all with the plan for that area, or maybe we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5980)|
| 1:39:50| have a plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| But that's my only concern, is that we move in the direction of 5th Avenue becoming highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| Okay, noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Mayor, I would just say that the property is presently zoned heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| So this kind of zoning would actually be down zoning that area from what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6016)|

| 1:41:23| Okay, council members, we have a few people who have signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| First is Melissa Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Ms. Stooksbury, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6093)|
| 1:41:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| My name is Laura Parrott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I am the president of the ATU 1136.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| My topic today is microtransit, and I would like to have this, thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6116)|
| 1:42:08| The proposed introduction of the microtransit is a topic that gives us great concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6128)|
| 1:42:16| The elimination of routes will do serious damage to the citizens and the economy of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6136)|
| 1:42:29| While we realize that there is a desire to reimagine CAT service, replacing portions of the existing service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6149)|
| 1:42:41| with more costly model will not solve our service walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| Service reductions during the pandemic due to decreased ridership were a necessary evil that transit agencies all over the world deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6170)|
| 1:43:08| To continue operating essential services and keep our communities moving given the troubled times coming out of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6188)|
| 1:43:22| Paratransit costs up to four times more to operate per ride than a fixed route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| So the microtransit using the same on-demand model as paratransit will be designed to cost just as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6210)|
| 1:43:41| Furthermore, the paratransit only exists because of the federal requirement to provide within a three-fourth mile area of the existing fixed routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6221)|
| 1:43:54| And the collateral damage of the paratransit service will result in created transit deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6234)|
| 1:44:03| Essentially entire communities and some of our most vulnerable citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6243)|
| 1:44:12| Please understand that we are not anti-microtransit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| In fact, we believe that a directly operated microtransit service fees into the existing fixed route service could be beneficial to our transit system and economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6258)|
| 1:44:35| Restoring the fixed route service alone would likely result in a return by riders who abandoned a system that abandoned them during the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6275)|
| 1:44:50| But as I said before, we haven't had enough time to see the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| The initial pilot, it doesn't identify any metric to the indication that the pilot would be a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6296)|
| 1:45:07| To measure success, to restore what we had before deciding that we currently exist needs to be cut on the reimagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6307)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6322)|
| 1:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6336)|

| 1:46:08| Well, that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| Is it possible for me to speak on their behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Well, you already had your opportunity, and I think that you did very much speak on behalf of, you know, the people you're representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6373)|
| 1:46:22| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Okay. I just had so much more to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240709?start=6387)|
