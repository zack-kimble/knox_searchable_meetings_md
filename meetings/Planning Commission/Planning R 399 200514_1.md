| 2:19:01| And then you've got a 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| And I'll make one more comment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| So just, again, to get everybody some understanding between the common area that we have here is about 1.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8344)|
| 2:19:18| The dedication right-of-way of a 50-foot right-of-way of 100-foot cul-de-sac is about another 1.64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8358)|
| 2:19:25| The front pond ends up taking up about 1.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| The rear pond's a little over 0.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| So if you total all that together plus the dedication along Beeler Road, there's about 5 acres taken out of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| And so you start to then understand, you know, the economics of trying to how do you make this to where you can do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8378)|
| 2:19:46| and then be able to build some type of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| And we don't bucket, you know, doing amenities and things like that, you know, willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| We all know that, you know, some amenities can kind of help sell the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| But we also see the other side that you all discussed earlier where somebody comes in and they see these beautiful amenities and they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| uh-oh, what are the homeowners' dues here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| And so, wait a minute, I've been approved for, you know, a certain amount for buying a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| Now I've got this additional payment that's got to go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| So just to give everybody kind of a take on general subdivision, this being about 10% of common area plus right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8414)|
| 2:20:22| detention costs and other things, we're roughly at, you know, not quite 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| Right at 30, more than 30% of this is in right-of-way or common areas and not really usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8428)|
| 2:20:35| So just to give you some kind of understanding of what we're looking at from an economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| Mr. Kirby, did you look at or talk to the county about reducing the payment width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| You've got 26-foot payment width from inside a curb, 50-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| I mean, there's no reason for a cul-de-sac road at this length to be 26 feet wide with a 50-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8452)|
| 2:21:00| Certainly 22 or, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| Well, and I think part of that falls back because I know that shows a 7% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| If you go out there, it's a beautiful rolling piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| It doesn't look near as steep as this particular drawing makes it out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| 7% is not straight up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| So it doesn't necessarily strike anyone as saying, oh, well, this falls under the hillside and protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| and we ought to look at some of those things so we can get that feedback from staff if all the requirements can be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| You know, it's usually when you go in there and you have some topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| that might not let you be able to meet those certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| You know, I'm open to, you know, a reduced payment width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| Trust me, we all know that in a narrower right-of-way that can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| At this point, you know, I know we're in May here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| We started this process for the rezoning back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| So, you know, we'd like to continue moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| If there was an opportunity that we could maybe look at that and consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| but we would at least like to get what we have here approved so that we can kind of move forward with our plans if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| And to be honest with you, the 50-foot right-of-way versus the 40-foot right-of-way doesn't change, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8532)|
| 2:22:20| it wouldn't allow for a much different design and layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| These lots are a little bit deeper at 150 just because, again, the width of the property lends itself to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| Taking 10 feet out of it, does it change much about how the property can be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| No, but it might get us some right-of-way, I mean some open space back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| But at the end of the day, it's going to end up still being in the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| But a narrower roadway means less culverts, less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8565)|
| 2:22:54| Yeah, no, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| So I don't know if Mr. Snowden is still with us on this Zoom, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| would the county consider reducing the pavement width down to 22, 24 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8582)|
| 2:23:10| We would love to explore that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| We assume those things come up between MPC and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| During the review stage, if we don't get any feedback, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| we tend not to request it because we just always assume that 50-foot right-of-way and 26-foot road is what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8600)|
| 2:23:27| We would certainly be open to, you know, trying to reduce that right-of-way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| It does help with grading as well when you have a property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| So we'd certainly like to consider it if it could be done during the design phase, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| If we could do that as a possible condition to approval here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| Commissioner Phillips, is that something that you want to ask county engineering with regards to road width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| Yeah, I would like for them to weigh in on that and why they think it's necessary for 26-foot wide roads that ends in a cul-de-sac, 44 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8634)|
| 2:24:06| Yeah, Commissioner Phillips, this is Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| In this particular case, I think engineering and public works would prefer to keep the 50-foot right-of-way and 26-foot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| just due to the, I mean, it's not within the slope or hillside and that additional pavement width could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| potentially allow for some multimodal, you know, a little bit extra room for the pedestrian due to the length of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8664)|
| 2:24:32| So it would be our recommendation to leave at 26 feet and 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| I agree with everything that Commissioner Phillips has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| One thing I did want to add as a comment to follow up on what Mr. Kirby said was I do think that a passive park without any equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8688)|
| 2:24:58| just a passive park is an excellent amenity and having a space, perhaps lot 21 and 20 become part of a passive park where the creek is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8698)|
| 2:25:09| That could be really lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| I'm not sure what that looks like when you're crossing past the detention basin to get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| but it'd be nice to have some connectivity to it and actually designate that as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| This is a feature for the neighborhood, but I also agree with Mr. Murphy's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| So this is a great opportunity for us to lift connectivity to what might happen in the future to other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8729)|
| 2:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| Yeah, those are all good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| I think I just when I look at this plan, I don't see anything that warrants a postponement or a denial thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8745)|
| 2:25:54| I just think that, you know, like a lot of money was spent on this plan based on what the developer, I'm sure, felt like he was supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8754)|
| 2:26:04| And if we are going to say every subdivision needs to have a passive park, we ought to just say that and or, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8764)|
| 2:26:13| It's just tough when these guys, they go in, they design, they pay engineers a lot of money to come up with these plans based on what they think, you know, they're supposed to do to get an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8773)|
| 2:26:26| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| I mean, I think those all these things are nice sidewalks, connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| And but this property is kind of a narrow piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| I'm not sure to what extent, you know, you have much to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8796)|
| 2:26:42| The blue line stream in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| You can't really you can't really redirect that or manipulate that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8804)|
| 2:26:50| I think this subdivision looks fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| At least fine enough to approve unless we start telling people on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| This is what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| And if you don't bring that, then then we are not going to approve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Then I think otherwise this is this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| I agree with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| And what Mr. Phillips said earlier is I think we're, I think if we're looking for something it's currently a little bit vague what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8843)|
| 2:27:32| And I would also agree that if we don't start looking for something better now, when do we start looking for something better so I think I think both of those points of view are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8852)|
| 2:27:43| I think we need to be a little or figure out a way to be a little more instructive at the front end to the developers before they get to this point in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| If there's if there are other things that we're really looking for in in the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| Mr. Clancy I see your hand up but I've got a question for Mr. Green first with this has come up several times during our meeting today with regards to, and it has in the past as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8878)|
| 2:28:11| Is a little bit more clear definition of what amenities are is this something that county commission would need to request of the planning department or is this something a project that the planning department would take on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8891)|
| 2:28:27| What is the process for for getting more definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| Planning Commission, especially since this is part of the subdivision regulations and affects the subdivision regulations and zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| We can look and better define amenities any amendment that would require a recommendation by the planning commission and approval by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8921)|
| 2:28:52| It's something that staff place. In fact, the planning commission could request that that be placed on the planning for program for the coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=8932)|

| 2:40:17| she would be happy to help answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| I don't see her on the attendee list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| She, well, we'll see if she pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| So anyways, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| So we put together a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Originally our plan was to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| for neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| And as Mr. Stoker could speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| we met with the neighborhood and discussed the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| and what the best scenario would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| And then right before we went through with that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| MPC suggested that we take the plan development approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| And so we quickly changed, put this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| and essentially we're taking the underlying things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| that would be allowed with neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| and then taking out the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| that don't really make sense in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| and trying to put those conditions on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| And so the idea is that it will be mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| There's enough parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| there's enough square footage on the site for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| There's access to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| It's a, I think 20,000 square foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| with a lot of different architectural types within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| It has a gym, it has a concrete building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| There's a lot of different things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| And I think it would really lend itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| to a mixed use type of, well, use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9707)|
| 2:41:56| And so of course, this is the preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| We've put together all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| that we can think of that would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9724)|
| 2:42:04| And I think, of course, this is the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| So after this, we'll get more in depth with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| but trying to kind of get everything into this one packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| and make sure that we've got a good start to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| Again, as Executive Director Green mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| about the plan development, it is a great tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| because this is in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| about less than a quarter mile away from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| And the idea of rezoning means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| that if something should happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| then anything could go on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| But with the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| it's not changing the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| but allowing for something very nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| to go in on that property, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| And appreciate your involvement with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| especially like the landscaping nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| that will fit in with our neighborhood's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| community wildlife habitat certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| Appreciate that attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| to what our neighborhood is trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| So with that being said, is there any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| We're on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| Unmute, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| Make a motion to approve the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| for the Galbraith School Adaptive Reuse Plan Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| including approval of the requested exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| to the underlying zoning dimensionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| and use standards subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| a second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| Oh, Commissioner Clancy, you lowered your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| Okay, so I don't see any other hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| I guess we have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9868)|

| 2:44:30| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9872)|

| 2:44:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9887)|

| 2:44:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Look forward to seeing what you folks come up with, Logan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| And now do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| Madam Chair, there is a, on the chat section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9906)|
| 2:45:16| there's someone, it's Chris Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| He missed line item 31 and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| You might want to address that question that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| The line item 31 was on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| That's for 10101 Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9935)|
| 2:45:39| to construction of a detached garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| with apartment above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| It was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And item number 32, 1707 Forrester Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| for construction of two duplex structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| on individual lots in the RA district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| was on, that was automatic postponement for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| I don't know if Mr. Bush requested the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| or what, but typically if it's automatic postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| it's a request from the applicant for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| Again, 31 was approved on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| for the detached garage with the apartment above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| and item 32 for construction of two duplex structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| was postponed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| and will be on the agenda for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| Yes, the applicant did request the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| And he also did have one other application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| on the agenda, number 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| That one was also approved on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| I've got also on chat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| I see Laura Edmonds name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| Which person did not get name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| I think that was for Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| Oh, and he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| But I think that we can probably get, find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| Commissioner Clancy, you have your hand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| and so does Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| Okay, we have a motion to second to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| And I don't think that there's one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| we don't need to do a vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| This was a great meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10046)|
| 2:47:26| This is our second virtual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| We may, it sounds like we will have another virtual meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| for our June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| And if you folks have any recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10056)|
| 2:47:39| of how this can be done or run better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| I'm very open to any comments or suggestions otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10062)|
| 2:47:50| See you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=10070)|
