| 2:02:22| I think last year what did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| We're drastically reducing the amount of money we're giving them this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| What did we give them last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| My book shows that we did not contribute to that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| If I'm reading this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| You're right if you're talking about East Tennessee Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| Yeah, I think that's a different agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Page 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| Mr. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I believe that's the agency that I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| It didn't work with the Development Corporation or the Chamber or the Innovation Valley, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| It works for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| And I suggested it be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Mr. Arms, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| Last year, the money that was given through the Innovation Valley, we gave Innovation Valley money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| and it went on to this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| This year, Innovation Valley has the Jobs Now initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| It's a new name, Innovation Valley Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| with a new focus that involves basically six chamber of commerces or six county type organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:34| with six chambers working together on numerous initiatives to continue job growth, focus on workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:44| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| This agency supports marketing and business growth in a 15-county region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| And instead of giving that money through the Innovation Valley last year, it's going directly to them, $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| Mike, either Mike, what's the $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| Commissioner, if you recall, last year we gave $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| I know we gave $400,000 to Jobs Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| This year, we're giving $200,000 to Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:22| So is this an additional $15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| It will be, and they do a different type of task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| This is working with some different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| The six areas that we mentioned, Loudon, Rhone, Teleco, Knox, and Blount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| we're marketing with them on one side of us, and we're giving them $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| On the other side, some of our partners who have helped us in the past, Severe, Grainger, Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| those counties are involved in this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| And I didn't want to totally leave them out, so I put $15,000 in it to help there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| So it's just as important that we grow on in North Knoxville and East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| as it is that we grow in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| So they're two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| Why do we have so many different little pockets that we put money in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| Why don't we just give it all in one block to the chamber partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| and then let them decide where they distribute it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| I just don't understand why we don't have just one economic development agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| that we run all this stuff through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| In the past, we did, and we ran it through Jobs Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| But Jobs Now was many more counties in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| So in this particular case, I felt like it's important for the continued growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| of North and East Knoxville, Knox County, that we support this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| at least to a small degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| When you look at the economic dollars we're spending, it's coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| which scares me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| And Mike Edwards, I thought, made a good point today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| But we do need to continue to promote that part of our county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| And those communities help us greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Does anyone care to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| I'd like to make a motion that we do not fund that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Motion's been made and promptly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Clerk, roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7575)|

| 2:09:01| Okay. We're still on community grants. Commissioner Moore? Thank you. Under contractual funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7741)|
| 2:09:09| the high school volunteer fire department was cut from $15,000 down to $10,000. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| like to request it go back to the original what they requested, $15,000. They have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| paid employees whatsoever. It's all. I'm sorry, I missed the first part. Could you? The high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:25| school volunteer fire department. Okay. It's $10,000. I'd like to move it to $15,000. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:34| have no paid employees whatsoever and it's in several districts that they respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:42| and it's in an area where there's no businesses hardly for them to go out to solicit money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7782)|
| 2:09:49| and with the economy the way it is, the citizens who live there are not being able to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| their money like they have been to try to help them. So our organization has no paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| employees that do the public service for that community. I think it's money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| Motion is to increase high school from $10,000 to $15,000. Is there a second? Second. Motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| made and seconded. Commissioner Leuthold? Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. Before we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:16| getting into it, and I agree, I plan on voting for this, but we have made some cuts to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7816)|
| 2:10:25| budget. So, John Troyer? It's under contract. I understand. How much have we actually cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:39| out of other areas of the budget that we could now possibly put somewhere else, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| a contractual or obligation or a grant or to schools or roads or anywhere else? You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:57| know, one of the only problems with that is we still haven't voted on the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| and that's a pretty... Well, that actually comes within the whole... I know, but we haven't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| Right. Let's just say, for instance, we get through all this process where we've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| through every amendment. All of that comes back to one vote and that's the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| plus all the amendments that were passed to pass the budget. So, when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:29| the inspector general part will be part of that vote. I just don't want to start allocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:38| out dollars somewhere else and not know. I know 15 isn't going to break it. No, if you'll let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:45| We were on contractual funding. Yes. So, on this one page and at the bottom, other county contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| and that's where that 50 was. So, as long as we was on this page, I was, you know, we could reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| that to 45. And I understand where you're going, but since we're just talking about contractual funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| It could be 35, but that's okay. 50 down to 15? No, they're already getting 10, so it's just five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| Oh, you're just increasing it by five. I thought you said they were getting zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| No, 25. 25. And, Mr. Troy, if you would keep a tally of any changes that are made to the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| Yes. The way that, including the inspector general, my tally is 313,308 so far. So, to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7938)|
| 2:12:27| And what about the 600,000 with the hiring freeze? The inspector general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| We're talking about the inspector, but I'm talking about also the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| Yeah, I mean, we have. We didn't, we hadn't intended to, but we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| I mean, that's something that we, my thought on that was that we'd leave the budget the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| and expect that we would make savings, and there's no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| We could amend the budget if you wanted to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| But I think our number is like 575 for, if you left in the referee, for half a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7975)|
| 2:13:04| Okay, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Okay, have we completed the contractual list? Can we now go into what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:15| We have a motion on the floor to increase from 10 to 15. It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| We're having discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| I have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| I thought we'd be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| So, if we could hold, we're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Does anyone have anything else to say about the increasing high school 10 to 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| Anyone else? Okay, let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| My light was on, Mr. Troy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| How disingenuous can we be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| We say that the budget projections are unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| We're going to be in a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| We work for an entire day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| We labor and we find a whopping $313,000 out of a budget of $640 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:56| And now we're going to find ways to spend it on good things that have been overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| I think we should adopt a pay-as-you-go thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| If you want to add $5,000 somewhere, you take it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| And any of the monies that we've saved, by golly, if we're going to put them anywhere, let's put them to our overstressed schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| We are just being penny-wise and pound-foolish with this budget, and this is just the crowning glory of a lousy meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:25| Mr. Harmon, we decided early on that we would do cuts first and then we would do additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| If you want to add some education dollars, you can put that up for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| But I think you can do that without insulting the rest of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| especially when we agreed on a process early on that we would cut first and add second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| Okay, gentlemen, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| Well, I just want to throw this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| I want to vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| But in thinking of this, you know, I thought the mayor came to the podium and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:58| and I think McKenzie and Pinkston has agreed to send this back to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| and let him look at it and do the surgical type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| You know, we could always suspend this right at this time and let them do that and bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| If we can save a million or two, it might be a whole lot better than our effort is going to be now or later on in the evening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| So would you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Well, they've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| We have a motion about high school, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| Well, let me be clear that I understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| And if the mayor or Dwight or anybody, did you offer that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:43| Are you talking about the million and a half that we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Well, I was thinking that maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| You know, we've not done a good job today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| If you want to talk about cuts, have we done a good job presenting a budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| Maybe that Knox County can live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| Well, you know that's up in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| I think you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| I mean, I made a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| And if we can live within those revenue projections and don't exceed them, I'm going to be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| I did make the offer, and I'm going to follow through with it, that we are going to make some strategic recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| We're going to withhold some money by executive order to be in the spirit of compliance, which a couple of commissioners had asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:20| But, yes, I think that you've eliminated some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| And if you want to replace it with something else, different expenditures, I think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| Because we think we're going to meet those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| I mean, that revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| Our motion on the floor is to increase the high school fire department from 10 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Clerk, let's call the roll starting in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8205)|

| 2:16:54| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8220)|

| 2:17:02| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| After we do this one, are we going to do this for every single one that each one of us may want to increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:19| We will have to address each one of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| I just had a question, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Was included in your motion was that you were subtracting $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| that you were moving $5,000 from the other column and adding it to the high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| Was that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| Well, I mean, I think that makes sense since the $50,000 is in the contractual funding page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:51| So you're moving $5,000 from the other and adding it to high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| Yeah, just taking $5,000 out of the $50,000 and adding it to the $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Then, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| That wasn't the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| The original motion was just to add $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| Well, wherever you all want to take it from, at the end of the day, I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| I understood it coming from the $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| You know, when I walked in here, I did not see money growing on trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| Is this everyone's understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| Well, this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| Let me explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| This is not a community grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| This is a service that's provided to citizens that don't have rural metro service out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:29| So I think we've always done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| And, you know, so if the $50,000, and I don't know, is the $50,000 in the contractual funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:40| Well, according to our law director, I'm going to rule that the motion was not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| So we'll revote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| The motion is to go $10,000 to $15,000 and reduce the contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| $50,000 to $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| $50,000 to $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| So let's revote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| Clerk, start on the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8331)|

| 2:19:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Motion passes 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:50| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| I would like to recommend that the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| they've been cut $10,000 to have another $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| We have two fire halls over there that represent South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| and it's a non-paid position, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| Nothing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| Nobody makes any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| And I'd like to take $5,000 out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| and give them the same thing that the high school just got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| We have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| Not on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| I had something else I was going to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Ready for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Just a second, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| So you're raising it to $15,000 and lowering other to $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| I don't know what she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:55| They have no paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Retired educators that are, again, doing a tremendous job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| and they're located at the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| the original Burlington post office in that facility after school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:19| They got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Could you tell me where the carpet bag theater is located at, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| I think they're in the arts emporium down at the other end of Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:36| You think that's where they moved in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where they moved in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| They're no longer on Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| That property might be one of the original people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| but they're not housed in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| I'll look to my Chair, but I'm pretty sure they're not in there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| Well, the reason why I was asking that, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| it looks like there's taxes owed on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| And I understand the Bailey and Bailey Emanuel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| and Linda Parrish gave that to the carpet bag theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| And taxes are due on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| And I would like, if this is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| take and give the Crutcher Memorial the $10,000 that we were giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| and raise that to $19,000 and cut out the carpet bag theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| Well, I think we probably need to deal with that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| I'd like to allocate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| Do we have a second to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| Commissioner Dufresne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Is that what they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| I actually was looking over what all these different panelists have contributed their time to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8560)|
| 2:22:50| And what I did is I looked at the overall score and the average funding percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:58| and I thought that probably we should not fund anything that did not get at least a 70 overall score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:06| or a 70% of average funding to honor the time that these volunteers spent in all these different panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:14| And if we did that, then this organization did not make the cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| But I just went through here, and I just feel like we need to somehow honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| and respect and try to value the time that they poured over all of these different grant applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:30| and interviews and applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| So I would not be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| That's what I honestly think that we have by not deallocating a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| I think that says that we honor you, we value what you did for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| and we're agreeing with you on the whole $2 million aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| I don't think that enters into this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| The Crutcher Memorial Youth Center got an overall score of 58, and average funding percentage was 69%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8637)|
| 2:24:06| I mean, it was one of the lowest ones of the youth funding recommendations by that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8646)|
| 2:24:13| I understand that, but I know what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| I know firsthand what they do, and I don't know how they present it or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| But whoever, and there's no disrespect to anyone sitting on that panel, but I challenge you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| I challenge you to come to me and prove to me that they're at the bottom of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| So we can vote on it, but I strongly disagree with that number because I know what they're doing personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:42| But I also challenge anyone to dispute the fact that they deserve this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:50| Mr. McKenzie, I believe this group did, they really worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:59| But the one thing that I see out of this group is that the high-end charities with the professional grant writers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:06| and the professional presenters seem to do really well, and the small pop charities didn't do quite as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:17| Now, I think, you know, I look at their recommendations with a tremendous amount of weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| but I also look at the recommendation of the commissioners that live in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8723)|
| 2:25:30| And I don't know where we got that the recommendations of the grant panel were carved in stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:37| and brought down from a mountaintop like some holy order from God himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| These are suggestions that we carried with a lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| And I'm going to agree with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| This is a charity in his neighborhood that he personally knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| They may not present themselves as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| They may not have a professional grant writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| But I trust him to make that recommendation, and that's why I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| And I don't know where we got, if we take the recommendations of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8762)|
| 2:26:08| and we use only that to make up our minds, then it will be the first time in the history of government that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:17| that a committee's recommendations were treated like holy dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| And I don't know where we got to the point that these recommendations were looked at like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| and I know one of the panel members is about to unload on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| I appreciate the work you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| I honor the work you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| But your work is a part of the overall work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| And the final decision is to be made by the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| and I intend to make that decision as a Knox County Commissioner who was duly elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Mr. Chairman, do we have a motion on the floor yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| You know, here's where I'm concerned with it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| Donna, how many were there altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| How many that you all approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| How many were there total, the ballpark figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| And youth funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| All five panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| Is Eric here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| Ms. McElvis, could you give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| It's Donna McElvis, 12630 Early Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| Eric, real quickly, how many applied and how many did you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| I believe it was like 140 that applied and about 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| That you all approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| It's like one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| I'm pretty sure it was 140 and then about 70 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| So I'll get the exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| Here's what concerns me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| This is where we could be here just all night and for four days because there's 19 commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| and we can everyone pick and choose and find their own favorite charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| This group did their work, did it in a professional way, and I want to try to reinvent the wheel with what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| And, Sam, I see what you're saying, and I emphasize with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Those groups next year will learn from what they didn't do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| And small mom and pop charities will have to go out and hire a professional grant writer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| and hire a professional presenter to put on their presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| Well, Commissioner, another thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| We're not going to have debate between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| And so let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| Ms. McElvis, I want to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| I wasn't through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| You didn't have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:40| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| Ms. McElvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| I had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Well, you were arguing with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| Well, he interrupted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| He interrupted me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| That was my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| Let me go get in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| Both of you get punished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| You know, if the groups did not get what they wanted to get, they've everyone got board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8936)|
| 2:29:04| A lot of these I serve on, board directors with them or have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| and by voting this way with what they, I make more work for me to do by going out here and have to raise these money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| But everyone of these groups have board directors, and it's not Knox County's government's job to just be the free agency out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:23| It's up to the board directors to raise the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| I'll yield if you will allow her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| It's up to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| I'm scared to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| Ms. McElvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| And Commissioner Lampert, I am not going to chew you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| I really am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| I came up to the podium because, number one, I am concerned that it would appear that some commissioners are going to start choosing certain agencies that they wish to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8982)|
| 2:29:54| and that's certainly within your rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| I would point out on Crutcher Memorial, since that's the one that's currently being addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| they requested $9,932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| The panel, had we had enough money, would have allocated $6,870.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:16| That was based on their score and the percentage that we assigned to that particular organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:24| There are a number of agencies ahead of Crutcher who did a better presentation, had a better application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:32| Maybe even they do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| Consequently, they scored higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| If you are going to fund Crutcher Memorial, then I would hope that you would not fund any more than they requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9037)|
| 2:30:45| I heard something about an additional $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| Well, they asked for $9,932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| So if you feel that you must fund them, I would not give them any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| That's all I have to say at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| At the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| I was beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| I'll yield to my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| Well, he's just going to tell you parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| We just look so much alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| Commissioner Lambert, if you look under youth funding, you've got Knox County Schools PTA didn't get funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| Big Brothers, Big Sisters, the Great Smoky Mountain Boy Scouts, Junior Achievement, the Tennessee Valley Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| Knoxville Leadership, UT, Montgomery Village, Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9088)|
| 2:31:33| These are not mom and pop organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| They're professional and they weren't able to get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| And my concern is that there's 20 organizations in front of Crutcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:47| So then we're going to hear from each one of these agencies and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| why did you fund this one when we had a higher score and performed better with these groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| And I don't see how we can justify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| And for me, while I agree that it's a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| I can't vote in favor of it because there's 20 other people in front of them that are just as worthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:13| and scored just as well or actually scored better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| And so I'm going to not be voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9141)|
| 2:32:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| We kept one of our sacred cows earlier and keeping our $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9146)|
| 2:32:32| I would suggest that there's going to be some of these that the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| obviously, you know, we could be here all night trying to figure out how to divvy this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| But if there's something that strikes you as something that you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| then I would suggest you use your $6,000 that you decided not to give up to this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:50| and you use it to fund those things that are personal to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| I'll give them $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Again, and I'm not going to really address any of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| Other than saying that I understand the public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9186)|
| 2:33:13| but when you're dealing with it can't be a popularity contest because ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| and I hadn't heard anything different than they got a score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| and then we showed up one day and said this one gets 50, that one gets 75, this one gets 85 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| based on anything statistical or having anything to do with their application or their interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| I think the process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| It's good to have that as a piece, and this is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| But I challenge the mayor's office and Mr. Hoagland in particular to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| Don't just, you guys are the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| You guys own the office and own the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| Just to pass these on, you all know what the people are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| So, next year, I'm going to challenge you all to take those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| and knowing a little more about the history of the countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| countywide history of how these organizations perform and behave, have some input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Again, this was the first time out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| Whether it passed, I think it passed, but I don't think it was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| Just a comment right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| The city of Knoxville, I don't see where they donated them anything in their community grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| You know, I agree that, you know, there's a lot of organizations I'd like to see funded in the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| But a citizens panel did their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| They sent it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we accept the community grants as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9288)|
| 2:34:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| A substitute motion to accept the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| They were presented to us by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| Do we have any questions on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:10| I have a question, and this is probably for Mr. Hoagland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| Under the youth funding, there is a grant called Project Grad Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| And as I understand it, we fund Project Grad through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| Why are we giving them an additional $82,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9322)|
| 2:35:28| Or why are we funding them an additional $100,000 when we fund Project Grad $2 million through the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| If we're funding them elsewhere in the budget, I guess I can't really speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| I can only speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Well, Project Grad has been funded how many years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Five, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| So I guess that's my concern is why have we been giving them an additional $100,000 in grant money for the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:57| when we're funding them through the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| What's the additional $100,000 for that's not being covered through the school system's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| Mr. Chairman, can I interject something at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| There is a Project Grad, which deals with, Mr. Chairman, that deals with, I believe, is at Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:22| and at some other high schools for kids to earn some scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| Then there's Project Graduation, which is where we have the graduation parties for the graduating seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9387)|
| 2:36:36| And I'm curious if this isn't that where I know they get some community grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| And I think it's a mislabeling to call this Project Grad because it's Project Graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:51| In fact, I know Farragut changed their name of their project graduation to Graduation Celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:58| so that there would not be this confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| Eric, do you think that that might be what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| Let me ask you this, Mr. Hoagland, because we did give a check to Bearden High School for Project Graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9424)|
| 2:37:10| It was a $500 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| And there's only, what, 11 high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| So $11,500 is only about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| And I don't know if this is the mix up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| Then what's the $82,000 then if we're only giving about $500 in checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| I did not bring their application down, so I can't speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| If I can interrupt you for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| I think Cindy Buttrey is here with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| I think the school board has asked for Project Grad's budget for the last, how long, six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9462)|
| 2:37:51| And they have refused to turn it over to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| Now, Eric, have they submitted a budget for this community grant, what their budget is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9476)|
| 2:38:03| Yes, they would have submitted a budget, and that would have been in their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| I can run upstairs and get that real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| And let's see where they're giving their money, because I think it only affects 13 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| And I think the school board had had some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| Since it only affects 13 schools, why don't we just give the $80,000, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| $80-something thousand dollars directly to the schools to let them use it for all the kids that go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9507)|
| 2:38:37| Now, I'm in favor of keeping it for the project graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| I think that that's an important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9520)|
| 2:38:41| Yeah, but this is Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| So it is Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| So it is Project Grad and not Project Graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| Cindy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| For this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Yeah, it's 80-something thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| It's $82,000 this year, but in the past we've been giving them $100,000 each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| Yeah, and I believe, I'm not sure, who is, Russ, who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| We've got two things, and Commissioner Luthold is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| There is a Project Graduation, small letters, and then there is Project Grad, caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| And that is Graduation Really Achieves Dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| That's what that stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| That is, we're in about the sixth year of a public-private partnership with that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9559)|
| 2:39:24| and the school system does fund about $2 million out of its budget to Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| for the services and programs that that organization provides within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| The remainder of its budget is drawn from other sources or public sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| or wherever its board goes to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| So they have a separate board that oversees that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| So that board is supplementing their budget by coming and getting a grant from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| If this is a Project Grad, all caps, application, then that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| It says Project Grad, Knoxville, and Grad is in all caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| That would have been an application from Project Grad, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| and that organization from the public side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| This substitute motion is already a motion that we will go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| That is part of Craig Lutho's motion that he made in the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| to accept all of the mayor's grant proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| So Craig already made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| It was part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| When we were going through the mayor's changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| we agreed that we would revisit those items that dealt with grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:46| So I think before we vote on the substitute motion to close off any further changes in the grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9646)|
| 2:40:55| I think we should go back to what we said we were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| and go back to what the mayor had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| The point is his motion, Scott's motion, is redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| I mean, you've already basically made that motion to adopt the budget as is with one change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| Budget as is includes the mayor's recommendations through that committee process for the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:18| These are amendments to the budget that the mayor is asking today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| and I accepted several of them as part of my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| but I did not accept those that dealt with grants because we hadn't got to grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| and we had agreed that we would come back to those amendments before we got any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:41| So you're voting on the changes as proposed by the mayor today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:45| Well, we haven't got to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| That's what your motion is, Scott, and that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| Are you including those changes that the mayor amendments or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| Hang on, let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| Page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| Yeah, what's left is Dr. Kim's health clinic for $25,000, East Tennessee Film Commission for $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| the Beck Center for $25,000, and the Kumba Festival for $25,000, WDVX for $25,000, Mother Goose for $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:14| and the Sertoma Center for $7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| That's the items that are on my list that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| How much is that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| Is that $180,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| You've got to remember some of those funds were coming from somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| so that they were not in addition to the overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| And that's why we needed to come back to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| Let's see if we can cut enough to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| Well, because I wanted to go through the entire budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| because what they're coming from may have been changed by the time we got here to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9765)|
| 2:42:53| So I guess what I'm going to do is ask Commissioner Moore, were you the maker of the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| if you could pull that for now so we can come back to this and then we can get back to what you're wanting to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9780)|
| 2:43:09| And I'm just asking that as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| Well, what if I just accept the rest of this, page six, and with my substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:22| Your substitute motion, though, is to approve the grant monies as proposed by the mayor's office, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:30| It's just accepted, from what I heard, we're going to just accept it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9810)|
| 2:43:34| as proposed by the mayor's office through the committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| Through the committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| And that's already been done by Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| And the mayor has an amendment to his original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| and that's what Commissioner Leuthold is talking about, is there's another $177,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| So your motion would more properly be to the amendments as proposed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| Well, I think what Commissioner Moore is trying to do, correct me if I'm wrong, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| is I think you're wanting to go ahead and vote and then we're done with community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| and we're not going to be revisiting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| If we go back and we were to find before we voted extra money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| then we wouldn't be going back to community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| I think let's put that thing to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| Well, see, my thing is that, like the Academy of Medicine, I'd like to see them get some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| and we've not addressed that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| So, although I'd like to vote for your substitute motion, I do want to see a very worthy cause get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9872)|
| 2:44:42| Well, I'd like to see a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| And we're going to be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| And the community people that served on the board, you know, next year maybe we'll have a better process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9887)|
| 2:44:56| or a different process, but, I mean, to go against what the people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9896)|
| 2:45:04| and we haven't done a very good job today reducing the spending of this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| So I don't want this thing to get loose like a wildcat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| when we start building up this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| Law Director, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| Well, a motion has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| A substitute motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| But, you know, it sounds to me like the motion had already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| It's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| And Commissioner Moore is suggesting that I believe that we include the other items as proposed by the mayor today as amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9932)|
| 2:45:41| So that would be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| Add that to your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| Or you could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9947)|
| 2:45:54| So we need to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| We'd have to vote on the substitute motion, which I believe he's included these changes that the mayor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| On page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| That's on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| But then we would not be voting on any more changes to community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9973)|
| 2:46:17| Do you need a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Well, if we're not, do you have a second on your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| Does everyone understand what the substitute motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| Not entirely, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| Can I try it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Do you mind, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9995)|
| 2:46:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| We're talking about community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:42| We have within my motion, the original motion was to accept what the citizen panel came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:50| which is what the mayor has proposed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| We accept that as is, except for the items that we have already, you know, through amendments changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| Plus, we're going to add those on page six that the mayor has made as amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10023)|
| 2:47:11| but then we will not make any other changes to community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Is there anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Yes, but you do, you know, in my motion of approving all this is a contractual funding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:25| So that leaves what's left in it, $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| Still $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| But we leave that back up to a citizen's group to allocate that $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:37| No, they don't have contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| We control the contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| They only control the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| We control community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| Well, I'm saying they didn't even talk about the contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| That's why when we changed that, that's not changing the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| That was something that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| So there's $40,000 left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| So I don't know where we can just save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| Let's just put that back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| What is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| Well, let me try it like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| Approve the community grants as a citizen's panel, as the mayor has recommended to us, as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10089)|
| 2:48:16| and adding what's on page six that the mayor is also requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:21| And then the $40,000 goes back into general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:26| Is everyone clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:31| We still have some lights on for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| I got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| Who did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| It wasn't sent to me yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| Did you call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10121)|

| 2:51:31| provide clothing allowance for any other administrative. My suggestion was that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| take that $7,500 and that it be allocated to the Stratoma Center. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| against the Stratoma Center but I just think that those detectives need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| because if they're out there doing investigating. This will not affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10306)|

| 2:52:03| there is a way and I just I don't know how this is all going to play out but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| think that there is a way to strategically do this and I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| Commissioner McKenzie that maybe the process was not perfect and I had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10331)|

| 2:52:20| at the budget hearings. At the same time I've talked to many of the panelists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:23| since then and I think that we can come up with a strategic way to honor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:29| respect the time that the volunteers used in reviewing these grants. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10349)|
| 2:52:36| would pick a number let's say 70 if you picked a number 70 for the overall score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10356)|
| 2:52:41| and 70 for a funding percentage and you went through I know that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| were concerned about the health services even if you didn't want to allocate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| funding to people who had a top or second salary that exceeded six figures I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10370)|
| 2:52:56| believe there's a way to do this and I believe there is a midway road. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| think that this is a lost cause and I really don't think we would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| here all night and I just wanted you all to know that that there is a way to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=10384)|

| 3:38:56| our bonds are interest only bonds or 80% are interest only bonds and I believe I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13136)|
| 3:39:02| discussion with you the other day and I wanted to be certain that I was clear on it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| I believe it was last year the year before last when they issued the sheriff's pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13147)|
| 3:39:12| bond at 57 million dollars there was also a 30 million dollar bond that was issued then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13152)|
| 3:39:17| that was a tax-free lower interest rate bond and the sheriff's bond was taxable at a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13157)|
| 3:39:21| rate and my understanding was is that we would pay off a higher rate bond quicker so we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13161)|
| 3:39:28| have to pay so much interest and that that other bond was an interest only bond until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13168)|
| 3:39:33| the sheriff's bond is that the only bond that's out that's an interest free bond yeah I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13173)|
| 3:39:40| we've got one or two that would be where the county has previously done a refinancing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13180)|
| 3:39:46| many times when we do refinancing and Mr. Ayers is here to address this also we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13186)|
| 3:39:53| refinance years 15 through 20 and replace that with years 15 through 20 and so if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13193)|
| 3:39:59| looked at that one bond issue it looks like we're paying interest only but we're trading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13199)|
| 3:40:04| 15 years for 15 years 16 years for 16 years and so we're not extending the life of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13204)|
| 3:40:10| bonds at all and so what you're asking is that we have those two bond issues that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13210)|
| 3:40:14| issued last year the pension which was more expensive and the capital plan which was less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13214)|
| 3:40:21| expensive and we those really need to go together but we had to do those because of the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| law as two separate issues but we consider them financially as one so the answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13225)|
| 3:40:33| so the answer to that is that 30 million dollar bond is the only interest only bond right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13233)|
| 3:40:40| Mr. Hammond John if you would the 40 million dollars would you break that down as to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13240)|

| 3:51:29| No. 4. 13. 3. Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County Tennessee establishing the Knox County tax rates for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13889)|
| 3:51:51| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I've got a couple of things. And I know there's going to be objections to this. So I'll go ahead and say I'll divide the question. First I want to deal with what's on page 5 in your booklet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13911)|
| 3:52:19| And it deals with removing 3 cents out of the general fund tax rate, which was currently $1.13. Change that to $1.10 and add those 3 cents into debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13939)|
| 3:52:40| I think it better reflects that we have more debt than we have. One thing this does is that when we do allocate a TIF, the only part of the county taxes that we get to continue to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13960)|
| 3:53:04| and keep is the part that goes toward debt service. So that by moving that from 33 to 36 cents, it keeps the money in the county coffers when a TIF is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=13984)|
| 3:53:24| I think it also is a little more honest with the people out there that we do have the debt that we have, and that's how we're going to pay for it out of our tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14004)|
| 3:53:46| The second part of it, and I've heard it all day, I've heard it for months, I've heard it for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14026)|
| 3:53:53| The people of Knox County approved a sheriff pension plan, knowing that there would be an 8 cent property tax impact on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14033)|
| 3:54:03| I don't like property tax increases, but we now have a sheriff pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14043)|
| 3:54:13| Mr. Troyer, we asked you this during budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14053)|
| 3:54:19| What is the impact that the sheriff's plan has had on our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14059)|
| 3:54:27| I think you responded with about 10 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14067)|
| 3:54:31| Yeah, I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14071)|
| 3:54:37| That's what I'm going to propose to do because when I walk into a store and I see something and when I pick it up, I look at the price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14077)|
| 3:54:49| If I want to buy it, then I pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14089)|
| 3:54:53| If I don't want it, I put it back down and I leave the store and don't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14093)|
| 3:54:59| The people of Knox County picked up the pension plan and decided to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14099)|
| 3:55:05| We're going to pay for this pension plan one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14105)|
| 3:55:10| The debt is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14110)|
| 3:55:13| And what I'm proposing to do is to add 10 cents on to the debt service portion of the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14113)|
| 3:55:31| And in doing so, that adds about $8 million into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14131)|
| 3:55:40| Now, what I'm going to do is I want to add that in so that we can, for instance, instead of having interest only bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14140)|
| 3:55:50| we can have bonds that we're actually paying off principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14150)|
| 3:55:57| We've talked about, Commissioner Moore, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14157)|
| 3:56:00| In the future, our capital budget shows not even being able to pave probably one mile of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14160)|
| 3:56:09| or construct it by the time we leave here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14169)|
| 3:56:13| We're getting ready to leave a legacy of debt to not just our kids but our grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14173)|
| 3:56:22| I always find it prudent when I borrow money myself, I try to pay off my debts quickly so I don't have to get eaten up with the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14182)|
| 3:56:31| And I think that's what's happening to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14191)|
| 3:56:35| So what I want to propose to do is to add that $8 million into the general debt fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14195)|
| 3:56:49| But the other thing I want to do is to come down here because I've also heard about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14209)|
| 3:56:54| Commissioner Mark Harmon has talked about it and many of the other commissioners on this body has talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14214)|
| 3:57:02| We need to do more for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14222)|
| 3:57:04| We've heard the school system say we're losing our quality teachers and we need to give them a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14224)|
| 3:57:12| But we can't necessarily do that ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14232)|
| 3:57:14| So what I'm going to do is where they have payment for general purpose schools coming out of the operational fund of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14234)|
| 3:57:23| of $4,369,055, I want to reduce that by $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14243)|
| 3:57:34| That will free up $3.2 million out of the schools operational funds so that they can use that to run the school system the best way they know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14254)|
| 3:57:48| But it keeps it within the debt portion of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14268)|
| 3:57:56| And I'm going to make those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14276)|
| 3:58:00| And I know that you'd want to divide the question on the two of them because you may support one and may not support the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14280)|
| 3:58:06| I'm not pleased with either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14286)|
| 3:58:09| But I just don't see how we can continue to try to do budgets where we've bought a very expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14289)|
| 3:58:18| Knox County has bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14298)|
| 3:58:19| We're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| It doesn't matter if you like it or you don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14301)|
| 3:58:24| Personally, Knox County has bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14304)|
| 3:58:27| And do we want to pay for it for the next 20 years or do we want to try to save some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14307)|
| 3:58:32| and try to get it paid quicker and save some interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14312)|
| 3:58:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14321)|
| 3:58:44| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14327)|
| 3:58:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14330)|
| 3:58:51| John Troyer, if you would weigh in on, first of all, the debt service proposal by Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14331)|
| 3:58:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| Commissioner Leuthold and I have talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| We're putting the pieces that we can into debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14342)|
| 3:59:06| It will reduce the value of a TIF, but it will increase current collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14346)|
| 3:59:12| So I'm very comfortable with Commissioner Leuthold's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14352)|
| 3:59:17| I can also say that as far as dedicating $0.10 to debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14357)|
| 3:59:21| we'll work with our bond counsel and our financial advisors to make our principal as high as we can be to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14361)|
| 3:59:31| or I guess to fully utilize any extra money that goes to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14371)|
| 3:59:37| So as far as the general fund, changing that by $0.03, you don't see that as having an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14377)|
| 3:59:42| Yeah, it's going to be revenue neutral in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14382)|
| 3:59:46| We're going to trade property tax dollars for other revenues, transfers from other funds, interest earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14386)|
| 3:59:53| and move those up to general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14393)|
| 3:59:54| The general fund is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14394)|
| 3:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14396)|
| 3:59:57| Secondly, I'm not so sure in talking with people that they really fully understood when they voted for the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14397)|
| 4:00:05| that there was a possibility of tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14405)|
| 4:00:08| And the reason I say that is when you looked at the advertising that was done by the FOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14408)|
| 4:00:13| and it was pretty extensive television advertising, the advertising stated that this, in their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14413)|
| 4:00:20| could be paid for by incorporating it into the general budget of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14420)|
| 4:00:26| I mean, I remember seeing it very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| That was the message that was sent by the FOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| That's what a lot of people saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| And so even though it was on the ballot and even though it was made clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14433)|
| 4:00:38| and we made clear in our meeting and I remember you had made the motion at that time for the eight cent to be put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14438)|
| 4:00:44| I don't know that people really fully understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| But you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14446)|
| 4:00:49| They did vote for it and we need to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14449)|
| 4:00:52| I can't vote for a property tax increase or any kind of a tax increase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14452)|
| 4:00:56| I am in favor of possibly having the citizens weigh in on something in the fall, which is another discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14456)|
| 4:01:02| But I will not be voting for a tax increase today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14462)|
| 4:01:05| But I do like your idea of the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| And if that works, then I'll be happy to support you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14467)|
| 4:01:13| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| Law Director, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14476)|
| 4:01:20| If the citizens voted for or the possibility of a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14480)|
| 4:01:27| and we're actually deducting funds from the general fund to pay for the part of the pension which we did not fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14487)|
| 4:01:36| are we breaking, I mean I've had several people, several attorneys tell me that we may actually be breaking the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14496)|
| 4:01:42| the charter or something that we're not executing properly if we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14502)|
| 4:01:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14508)|
| 4:01:50| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14510)|
| 4:01:53| I don't think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| We get back to the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14515)|
| 4:01:58| I mean I'm a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14518)|
| 4:02:00| I hate tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14520)|
| 4:02:01| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14521)|
| 4:02:02| Like most of my counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14522)|
| 4:02:04| I hate them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14524)|
| 4:02:07| But if you want to look at the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| Well. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| Dems don't like it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14530)|
| 4:02:12| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14532)|
| 4:02:19| The question that was posed that was put before the public regarding the uniformed officers pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14539)|
| 4:02:25| did address an anticipated property tax impact to be eight cents per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14545)|
| 4:02:31| It did also relate that there was an unfunded liability for the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14551)|
| 4:02:39| which obviously has to be funded at some point in some manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14559)|
| 4:02:43| of $57.1 million as of July 1, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14563)|
| 4:02:47| That was also in the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14567)|
| 4:02:49| Those are big numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14569)|
| 4:02:53| So, anyway, ultimately I don't have. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14573)|
| 4:02:58| So, anyway, ultimately I don't have a major heartburn with the question as it was put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14578)|
| 4:03:06| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14586)|
| 4:03:10| So what you're saying is you see nothing that would require us to have a tax increase to cover this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14590)|
| 4:03:20| Oh, it's got to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14600)|
| 4:03:23| But is it correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| Is there anything wrong with taking it out of the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| I mean, I'm not in favor in doing that for the simple fact that we take it from schools, we take it from roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14608)|
| 4:03:34| we're taking it from wherever to help fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14614)|
| 4:03:38| It's got to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14618)|
| 4:03:40| Yes, it has to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14620)|
| 4:03:42| It is a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14622)|
| 4:03:44| Do you wish to raise taxes or do you wish to make cuts elsewhere and take the funds from elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14624)|
| 4:03:52| Which is what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14632)|
| 4:03:53| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| Tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14635)|
| 4:03:56| Mainly from schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14636)|
| 4:03:57| Mainly from schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| Their budget goes up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| I have my light on first, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14643)|
| 4:04:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14646)|
| 4:04:11| I'm never for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14651)|
| 4:04:14| But if ever there was a time that a tax increase should not even be thought about, it's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14654)|
| 4:04:24| People in the private sector are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14664)|
| 4:04:27| People are losing their homes with the mortgage crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14667)|
| 4:04:31| People are paying several times for gasoline than they were just a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14671)|
| 4:04:40| People are losing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14680)|
| 4:04:42| They're getting laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14682)|
| 4:04:43| Now, we just passed $40 million worth of debt so we wouldn't have to have a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14683)|
| 4:04:49| Now, I reluctantly did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| But I voted for the debt because I certainly didn't have an answer as to what we do with a tight budget year like we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14691)|
| 4:05:01| But the last thing we should consider doing is have a tax increase right now when folks are hurting the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14701)|
| 4:05:09| And I just think it's absolutely ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14709)|
| 4:05:12| I plan on voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14712)|
| 4:05:15| And, honestly, I think if we pass a tax increase in the climate that we have right now with all of the as bad as the economy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14715)|
| 4:05:26| I think you're going to have some citizens that will be up here with pitchforks and torches ready to burn this courthouse down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14726)|
| 4:05:33| And, honestly, I can't blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14733)|
| 4:05:37| If there's ever a time that a tax increase should absolutely not even be considered, it's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14737)|
| 4:05:48| Commissioner Lutho, your proposal is to keep the tax rate the same, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14748)|
| 4:05:52| No, it would increase the tax rate by ten cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14752)|
| 4:05:56| Now, the divided question, the three cents, if the additional ten cents does not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14756)|
| 4:06:04| then the second part of the question is to just move the three cents from the general fund to the debt fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14764)|
| 4:06:11| Now, you've got to remember, a ten cent property tax increase would equate to a $25 increase to someone's taxes on every $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14771)|
| 4:06:21| Your motion is to raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| And it would leave the schools the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14785)|
| 4:06:31| I think it's 123.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14791)|
| 4:06:34| But, you know, Commissioner Lambert, I have heard you talk about debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14794)|
| 4:06:40| I've heard people talk about we've got interest only debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14800)|
| 4:06:46| I've talked about, you know, people have talked about we wish we had more money to do different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14806)|
| 4:06:52| And we've not been able to come up with any cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14812)|
| 4:06:58| I don't know who to blame for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14818)|
| 4:07:00| Well, I was here ready to vote for any reasonable cut that came up, and I voted for quite a few of them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14820)|
| 4:07:06| And I voted for some, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| And, again, I want to say that you're ideal about changing the, altering the amount that can be tiffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14828)|
| 4:07:17| but not raise the taxes for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14837)|
| 4:07:20| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14840)|
| 4:07:21| But raising the citizens' taxes right now when the citizens are struggling the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14841)|
| 4:07:27| And, Commissioner Lambert, that's why I've struggled with this for the last several weeks, because I hate raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14847)|
| 4:07:38| But these are the things that I have heard from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| It's what I've heard from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| The public has told you they need a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| The public complains about our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14865)|
| 4:07:48| The public has complained about not having enough money for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14868)|
| 4:07:52| And this is a chance to try to do a little of both, to try to pay off our debt sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14872)|
| 4:07:58| save some money on interest in the long run, and to help the schools out somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14878)|
| 4:08:03| Now, you're welcome to have your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| You're welcome to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14885)|
| 4:08:08| Well, if you think the public would support this, why don't we put it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14888)|
| 4:08:12| and let the public decide whether they want a property tax increase or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14892)|
| 4:08:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14898)|
| 4:08:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14901)|
| 4:08:22| Going back, the $0.08 that was on the ballot with the Sheriff's Department pension, what would $0.08 bring in, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14902)|
| 4:08:31| Eight times $800,000, so $6,400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14911)|
| 4:08:35| $6,400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14915)|
| 4:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14917)|
| 4:08:38| What do we pay on the bond for the Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14918)|
| 4:08:42| Last year, $3.85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14922)|
| 4:08:44| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14924)|
| 4:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14925)|
| 4:08:46| So I just want to make the citizens at home aware that we're paying this bond back off at $3.85 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14926)|
| 4:08:56| when we had $0.08 or $6.4 million a year on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14936)|
| 4:09:04| And this is all I've heard from people over the last two years talking about appointments and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14944)|
| 4:09:11| Let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| We're going to have special elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14953)|
| 4:09:14| We're going to have all kinds of elections because we want to hear from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14954)|
| 4:09:18| And we heard from the people on the Sheriff's pension, and they said they wanted to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14958)|
| 4:09:22| They wanted to pass it for our deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14962)|
| 4:09:25| And, you know, Commissioner Hammond can sit there and say that people didn't understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14965)|
| 4:09:31| but that's what the voters voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14971)|
| 4:09:35| And now we're sitting up here saying the voters made the wrong decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14975)|
| 4:09:40| I mean, they may make wrong decisions on voting for elected officials because of TV ads and slick talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14980)|
| 4:09:46| but, you know, they still get to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14986)|
| 4:09:49| And to say that now the citizens made a mistake because they got to vote for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14989)|
| 4:09:55| Sheriff, I don't want this sheriff being blamed with a pension plan that we put $0.08 on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=14995)|
| 4:10:05| to try to scare people off from voting for it when it wouldn't have took $0.08 in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15005)|
| 4:10:10| Sheriff, I don't think I could have said it any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15010)|
| 4:10:13| I don't even know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| I sit back here, and I listen to people say that the FOP presented it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15015)|
| 4:10:20| and sure it was on the ballot this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| A third grader could read exactly what was on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15022)|
| 4:10:27| We sit up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15027)|
| 4:10:28| We want amendments on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15028)|
| 4:10:30| Let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15030)|
| 4:10:32| Let the people vote on the charter ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15032)|
| 4:10:34| Let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15034)|
| 4:10:35| And the same people who want the people to vote now say the people made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15035)|
| 4:10:43| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15043)|
| 4:10:44| You can't have it both ways, to quote my good friend Dwight Vanderbilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15044)|
| 4:10:49| Okay, I want to get back, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| If $8 million would bring in $6.4 million, we're going to say if this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15052)|
| 4:10:57| You mean $0.08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15057)|
| 4:10:58| $0.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15058)|
| 4:10:59| If this was to pass and you have $6.4 million, we were going to fund some of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15059)|
| 4:11:04| Well, what I asked for was because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15064)|
| 4:11:07| You asked for $0.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15067)|
| 4:11:08| I asked for $0.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15068)|
| 4:11:09| And the reason for that is the other component of the cost of the sheriff's pension plan was the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15069)|
| 4:11:18| which was what the bond was floated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15078)|
| 4:11:21| But because there is a component going forward that was more expensive than what was currently, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15081)|
| 4:11:30| currently being paid for, that's the additional cost that makes up that $0.10 on top of the part that's the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15090)|
| 4:11:39| Now, you've got to take a look at, you look at our budget and underneath, under general debt fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15099)|
| 4:11:47| we're still pulling $6.5 million out of our bond fund, which is a fund balance, to pay our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15107)|
| 4:12:00| As of right now, we don't even bring in enough revenue to do all that we're going to do plus pay our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15120)|
| 4:12:08| It's like I have an income and I can pay all of my bills except for my house bill, and I'll just pull that out of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15128)|
| 4:12:18| Well, how long do we want to keep pulling out of savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| Because we're still pulling $6.5 million out of savings to pay our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15140)|
| 4:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15146)|
| 4:12:27| And that's exactly the point that I was at earlier today, that we need to cut the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15147)|
| 4:12:33| I've sit here and tried since 8 o'clock this morning to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15153)|
| 4:12:38| to do it in areas that's not going to affect our citizens in a responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15158)|
| 4:12:44| And we've sit here all day and cut $7,600 one place and $50,000 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15164)|
| 4:12:51| And, I mean, the people at home, I say in the morning they're going to be so mad that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15171)|
| 4:12:58| they're probably going to take it out on some of the people running for this commission like they took it out on me a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15178)|
| 4:13:04| So I'm not supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| And I think we should have done some cutting to this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15185)|
| 4:13:09| and sent a sensible budget to the people in Knox County for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15189)|
| 4:13:13| Well, one thing I do agree with you, Commissioner Moore and the Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15193)|
| 4:13:18| the people that I've talked to understood what they were voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15198)|
| 4:13:23| I mean, everybody I've talked to understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15203)|
| 4:13:26| and were curious as to why they didn't get an eight-cent tax increase last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15206)|
| 4:13:32| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15212)|
| 4:13:35| I'm going to have to speak against the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15215)|
| 4:13:38| It's just unfortunate that we've had the convergence of increasing fuel prices, of increasing food prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15218)|
| 4:13:47| an economic downturn, and then also all the events that have taken place with these audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15227)|
| 4:13:54| I'm just really concerned that we would have a taxpayer revolt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15234)|
| 4:14:01| that our dollars haven't been spent necessarily well down here and we're just asking for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15241)|
| 4:14:07| Well, that's, Commissioner Briggs, that's why I'm putting all of this in the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15247)|
| 4:14:13| so that it cannot be spent for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15253)|
| 4:14:16| It's not a tax and spend tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| It's a tax to pay off our debt where we've already spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15259)|
| 4:14:25| The money's spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| We're going to pay for this pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15267)|
| 4:14:28| We're going to pay for the other debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15268)|
| 4:14:31| Do we want to pay for it now or do we want to pay it over the long haul with a lot of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15271)|
| 4:14:36| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15276)|
| 4:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| I'm not speaking for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| I'm just trying to clear up a part that I'm unfamiliar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15281)|
| 4:14:45| In speaking about the $0.08 for the sheriff's retirement fund, is that something that has a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15285)|
| 4:14:54| Is that a four-year, five-year, ten-year, or $0.08 a year for the rest of our lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15294)|
| 4:15:01| Do you want to answer that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15301)|
| 4:15:04| I think this is an ongoing obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15304)|
| 4:15:07| and as long as we have a sheriff's department and sheriff's deputies that are participating in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15307)|
| 4:15:12| they're getting paid, they're earning years of service, they're earning salaries, they're earning retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15312)|
| 4:15:17| The reason I was asking that is I didn't know if we had some shortfall unfunded up front that we had to borrow the money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15317)|
| 4:15:24| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15324)|
| 4:15:25| The day that it was adopted, it went into effect July 1, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15325)|
| 4:15:31| and on that day the county had a prior service cost of $57 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15331)|
| 4:15:37| which is the bond issue that was $57 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15337)|
| 4:15:40| to be able to say that when we started the pension plan that we borrowed the money to be able to say that we're net equity of zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15340)|
| 4:15:48| Our net worth of our pension plan was zero because we borrowed the money to put it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15348)|
| 4:15:52| and now we're making payments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15352)|
| 4:15:54| And every year as deputies get more experience, every year that the deputies get raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15354)|
| 4:15:59| every time we hire a deputy, then that increases our future liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15359)|
| 4:16:03| So we borrowed money up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15363)|
| 4:16:06| We took a loan out up front that will never be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15366)|
| 4:16:09| It will be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15369)|
| 4:16:10| And you heard discussion that it's not being paid off fast enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15370)|
| 4:16:13| but we're on a 20-year schedule to pay that $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15373)|
| 4:16:18| So this $0.08 a year would retire something that we're looking at that's 20 years long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15378)|
| 4:16:26| Well, no, that 20 years just is how long it takes to pay the prior service costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15386)|
| 4:16:33| or what the deputies had already earned before the plan started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15393)|
| 4:16:39| And then once the plan started, then your liability just goes up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15399)|
| 4:16:44| So we've got two components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15404)|
| 4:16:46| You've got to pick up everything that was from the past, and then we also have to pay for everything from the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15406)|
| 4:16:51| And so $57 million was the part where everything was from the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15411)|
| 4:16:55| So then the $0.08 a year that we're foregoing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15415)|
| 4:16:59| we're foregoing next year and for the rest of our lives, we're going $0.08 a year in the hole forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15419)|
| 4:17:07| Well, it's not necessarily in the hole, but what it does is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15427)|
| 4:17:10| and I think Commissioner Leuthold is talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15430)|
| 4:17:13| is that it is crowding out other initiatives or other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15433)|
| 4:17:18| I think Commissioner Moore spoke of it, is that you look at our capital plan, you look at our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| and there's a lot of things out this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15442)|
| 4:17:24| And that's because we're, part of that is we're paying on our pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15444)|
| 4:17:31| So, yes, because there's not additional revenue, we have an additional expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15451)|
| 4:17:35| And that means, you know, it's just like at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| You only have so much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| And so that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| But with each new deputy that you hire, you obligate yourself 25%, the difference of 50 and 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15461)|
| 4:17:51| But with each new deputy you hire, they come more near funding it than the 50 to 75% retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15471)|
| 4:17:59| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15481)|
| 4:18:02| The debt will not go up because the new hires are basically funding their portion themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15482)|
| 4:18:08| And they're also contributing to the overall pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15488)|
| 4:18:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15491)|
| 4:18:12| And so we're very careful to go with the actuary's recommendation that once we've contributed the $57 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15492)|
| 4:18:19| and now we're contributing last year was 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15499)|
| 4:18:22| This year it's going to be 10.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15502)|
| 4:18:24| That's what the actuaries tell us that we need to put in in order to make this a healthy pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15504)|
| 4:18:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15513)|
| 4:18:34| Mr. Owens, I can't believe what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15514)|
| 4:18:39| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15519)|
| 4:18:40| We borrowed this money, and you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15520)|
| 4:18:44| I believe you said we could fund this with $6 million a year without borrowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15524)|
| 4:18:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| No, that's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15531)|
| 4:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15532)|
| 4:18:53| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15533)|
| 4:18:54| I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15534)|
| 4:18:55| I mean before we put it on, you know, I mean before we voted for the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15535)|
| 4:19:01| We heard a number of different things before we voted on the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15541)|
| 4:19:05| We had an ordinance that was also passed that explained it in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15545)|
| 4:19:11| But I thought you came up with how we could make payments on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15551)|
| 4:19:14| It didn't have to be fully funded all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15554)|
| 4:19:16| It did not have to be fully funded all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15556)|
| 4:19:18| And that was also within the ballot question and also within the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15558)|
| 4:19:23| The fact is it was determined that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15563)|
| 4:19:26| The past liability would be funded all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15566)|
| 4:19:30| And so that's where the $57.1 million came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15570)|
| 4:19:35| It was an unfunded liability, and that was clearly laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15575)|
| 4:19:41| And what we decided to do was to pay for that, go ahead and get that more or less off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15581)|
| 4:19:49| but to take care of that liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15589)|
| 4:19:52| But it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15592)|
| 4:19:56| Well, you know, I can't believe that we sit here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15596)|
| 4:20:01| We're coming up now and wanting to tax people and only made about $300,000 worth of cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15601)|
| 4:20:07| and most of that was in one position, the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15607)|
| 4:20:12| Now, I really feel like that this 2% that I asked everybody to take across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15612)|
| 4:20:23| Mr. Briggs suggested it go in a contingency budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15623)|
| 4:20:26| These department heads would have made a surgical cut things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15626)|
| 4:20:32| They would have found the fad in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15632)|
| 4:20:35| But to come back and ask for $0.10 without repealing the wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15635)|
| 4:20:39| when I presented a plan that would have been a burden off of the average everyday Joe out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15639)|
| 4:20:47| he would have saved money and we could have raised the taxes as much as $0.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15647)|
| 4:20:52| I think it's ridiculous to come back and ask for a $0.10 tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15652)|
| 4:20:57| I can't help but say I cannot vote for any kind of tax increase without cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15657)|
| 4:21:03| And I made that perfectly clear that my tax increases included repealing the wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15663)|
| 4:21:10| and there's no way that I can support a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15670)|
| 4:21:14| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15674)|
| 4:21:16| We're going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15676)|
| 4:21:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15678)|
| 4:21:19| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15679)|
| 4:21:21| The first is a tax increase, 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15681)|
| 4:21:24| $0.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15684)|
| 4:21:26| $0.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15686)|
| 4:21:30| Eleven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15690)|
| 4:21:34| Is that the first, your first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15694)|
| 4:21:38| We can vote on it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15698)|
| 4:21:40| Which one do you want to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15700)|
| 4:21:42| Let's vote on the tax increase first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15702)|
| 4:21:45| $0.10 tax increase is the first, starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=15705)|
