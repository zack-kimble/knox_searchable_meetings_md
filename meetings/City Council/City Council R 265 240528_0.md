| 0:09:13| KPD is a great example of doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| It is no secret that we are, not to use this term lightly, severely understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Our current staffing level is 347 sworn officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Our authorized strength at the time is 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Using those provided numbers, we are 69 officers short on our authorized strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| To put that into perspective for you, we currently have 18 squads of men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| working in the Field Operations Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=581)|

| 0:09:48| Those squads range in strength from 10 officers down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| That is an average, a quick average, of 6.6 officers per squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| If you take the average staffing of a patrol squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| versus the level of our staffing and authorized strength now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| we are close to being 10 entire patrol squads short of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| I use the patrol field operations numbers as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| because those officers are the most easily identifiable representation of the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| and are oftentimes the most recognizable symbol of the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=618)|

| 0:14:25| As we talked about Thursday, and Mayor, I told you then that it's not completely your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| Some of it is our fault, because you are not educated on the way we do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| the ranks in which our EMS system works, and the way that we fully operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| So that's on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| You can blame it on me if you want to, but that's on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I also proposed, with the help of President McAfee and Chief Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| to put together a full-on EMS demonstration at the Union Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| and have everybody there so you can actually learn what it's really like out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| what we really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Like a recruit told me in this last Recruit Academy, this is not Chicago Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| This is the real deal, and what we do out there on the streets is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| not excluding basic EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Basic EMTs play a vital role in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| There is not a way in the world we can function without them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| and I'll get to numbers in a second here to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| It's also not their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It's also not the basic EMTs' fault, but that's the level they're trained to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| That is the level we train them to in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| The state made decisions a long time ago, a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| to change from Ivy Tech to advance to basic, and it messed some things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| That is the level we train them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| So they have done everything that is expected of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Our department is getting ready to put on an AEMT class, hopefully this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| for those to transition up from basic to AEMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| It's a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| It's going to involve the state, national registry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| and a lot of instructors and a lot of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| But our department, with the help of Chief Sharp, is willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| and that is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| In the meeting Thursday, Mary said you saw it as an incentive to go on to AEMT school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| That's one way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| But right now they're not really offered that AEMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| The way I see it is a thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| It's not much, but it's a thank you for the work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| They're out there with us every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| and that's just a little thank you and appreciation for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| And trust me, what they do is a lot, and hopefully we'll get to show that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| It also helps with retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| I also mentioned to you that you come into our academy at this pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| BMS goes to this with a basic, and their surrounding departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| I will not name their names out of respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| where our basic EMTs we just trained can leave and go work for $5,000 or $6,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| So just this thank you would help in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| I've talked to a lot of basic EMTs that look forward to going to the advanced EMT school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| but it's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Every single person in this room knows dealing with the state is never quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| It is going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| I brought some numbers. I know you guys like numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| So with KFD, we have 118 basic EMTs, 153 advanced EMTs, 32 paramedics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| and proudly 12 critically care trained paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Total of 315, 118 basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| The EMT class we're going to put on this fall, 16 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| They will attend class two days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| The other days they are going to work their regular shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| So say your shift's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you're in class Tuesday, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| Class, as of right now, will be 20 students apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| If you take 118 basic EMTs, that's not including people we added in the recruit classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| 118 we have right now divided by 20, that's six EMT classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Six 16-EMS classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| If you did them back to back to back, that's one year, 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| That's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| It will take at least, if you did two classes a year, three years to get everybody trained to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you so much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Council members, that concludes the three slots for people speaking in favor of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Just as a point of information, thanks to Chief Sharp and the association's advocacy a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| this council adopted a budget where every single firefighter will get a 4.2% raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| if this budget is adopted, every single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| So I just didn't want to, I just wanted to make sure everybody was aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Even the ones who choose not to get the advanced or paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So, just FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Any comments or questions by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Oh, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Yep, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Are we done with all the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay, just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| I was glad to see in the budget that supervisor pay for KPD remained competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| However, this budget does address patrol pay, which did need an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| And so to remain competitive, I'm really glad to see that the new starting salary will be just a little over $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| That's really important to make sure we can deal with the shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| maintaining folks that we have and be able to deal with recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Also, thinking about what we heard from our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| we need to remain competitive with our fire services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| So certainly, I think a compensation study in 24-25 for our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| to make sure they remain competitive with other East Tennessee departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| is something we really need to be looking at in the next budget cycle after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| When we're thinking about challenges that we have for our uniformed officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| but then for everybody that lives in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| housing, which we're going to talk about a lot in this budget, for having affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| housing is critical on many levels for what we need to do here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| But when you're trying to recruit uniformed officers or people to work for the city, that's a challenge as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| Our estimates had been about 500 units a year in a recent workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| And I think it's critical that we continue efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| and focus on doing mixed use on the commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| because the only place that we're going to be able to address the kind of need we have for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| This budget does not issue any new debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| and it continues the trend that we've seen of meeting our obligations in a fiscally responsible manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| and then steadily decreasing the burden the taxpayers have on any debts that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| and providing for long-term economic stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| You're not seeing any cuts, you're seeing increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| And you're still seeing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| You know, just thinking about sidewalks that you've seen on, I mean, just in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| just on Kingston Pike, we've seen additions of bike lanes and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| That means that people can use the bus more and they can walk more to and from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| And so we need to see more of that continuing, and so I'm glad to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| We're seeing an increase in the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| It's going up about 7.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| We've got money in here for traffic calming, which is really important and necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| And about $175 million is going to support Knox County schools from the local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| That's $175 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Mayor, the only thing I would say is we don't have any money for new sidewalks this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| but hopefully we can see that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| But I plan to vote for the budget, and I just wanted to highlight some of those good efforts that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I have shared some of my concerns at our first reading on the budget, and those concerns remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1348)|
| 0:22:39| I think we have some very urgent needs when it comes to our city staff and the cost of living in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1359)|
| 0:22:59| And I appreciate hearing from both police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| I also keep in mind our other city workers who are at a lower end of that pay scale than the ones that we're even talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1384)|
| 0:23:19| Especially with how we are choosing to pay for the salary increase, it concerns me how we'll be able to address other salary needs in our city in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1399)|
| 0:23:42| And it's changes that are happening so quickly, I haven't fully been able to wrap my head around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| Because when we discussed budget projections in February, we were more hopeful of what we would see from that local option sales tax than what was realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1430)|
| 0:24:10| And after seeing that updated number, choosing to still move forward with the salary increase, I do not feel like it's the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1450)|
| 0:24:25| I'm also concerned, as I said before, that we're not doing a full review of what may be the issues with recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| Whether it is salary, whether it is benefits, whether there are other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| We've been talking about the internal climate, the culture within KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Could that potentially be part of the issue with recruitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| I'm also concerned about our investment in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| I'm glad that that was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And I'm appreciative of this report that was shared with us in February about our various affordable housing strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1503)|
| 0:25:13| I wish the report would start at 2021 when we adopted the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1513)|
| 0:25:24| The fact that the inventory goes back to 2019 makes things confusing because a lot of these projects were approved under a different city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1524)|
| 0:25:34| Or at least the city council that predated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| And we had a prior administration who celebrated on their way out, adding 4,500 units to our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1539)|
| 0:25:51| Now we're double counting some of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| And so it's hard to gauge where we're at with meeting our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| Even the 500 per year investment, which we're not coming anywhere close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| And then if you dig into it even deeper, you might find some apartments that we've provided funding for that are income restricted, but they also have a minimum income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1569)|
| 0:26:27| I think it was Pond Gap Flats, or maybe it was Yonkai Flats I was looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| And you have to make at least $11,000, it was Yonkai Flats, to qualify to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| So if we look back at our chart, the second largest category of renters with a lack of inventory are those making under $10,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1601)|
| 0:26:57| If we look at where our investments are going towards that income range, it's largely Austin Homes, Revitalizing Western, which were projects already ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1617)|
| 0:27:17| We've come in to help with them, but they were already ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Those units were scheduled to be redone, as KCDC needs to do with all of our public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| Council Member Parker, I'm going to give your colleagues who have their lights on a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| Vice Mayor Smith and then Council Member Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| I plan to support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| I just want to kind of call out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| We met a week and a half ago and spent eight hours together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| The public probably didn't have time to watch all that or attend, but some of the things that stuck out to me, some of which have already been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| but recruiting and rewarding both KPD and KFD, continued investment in the Affordable Housing Fund of $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| Again, that's just city dollars, so like Western and like a lot of other developments around our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| our dollars are the smallest dollars that go into the whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| So $8 million won't do a lot, but that's not all we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I'm really excited about the capital investments in East Knoxville, particularly the fire station in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| and additional investments that will be used, again, piggybacking federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| and the investment I think that will happen in East Knoxville in a very careful, thoughtful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| I'm really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| There's significant dollars in different pieces, but in very meaningful ways in pedestrian infrastructure across South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1719)|
| 0:28:48| and I'm just really excited about those items particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| I did have a question that a lot of folks have asked me about housing for those that need it the most urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| The low barrier shelter that we have in the community has closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| and so I just want to make sure while we don't have, at least I don't know of, a new plan for a new location to replace that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| I just want to make sure that the budget can adapt as needed when that opportunity arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Absolutely, and we're working with Aaron Reed and the Joint Office of Housing Stability to try to find a new provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| And I just want to make a plug for, and I was really, really enjoyed the joint housing workshop that you hosted with Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1765)|
| 0:29:36| and I think everybody, most people that have a hand in helping those without homes were there and talking about new strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| but I just want to kind of lean into the need that I heard there for a day resource center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| That's been the one thing I've seen in all the communities that do well in making progress on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| We need a place where we can all as a community point people to during the day and say whatever resources we do have, it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| and every agency that collaborates with the city has a chair there and is willing to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Too many times folks fall through the cracks that are within our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| We all need more money locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| We need things like Medicaid expanded that would help in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| but the things that are within our control are collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| and every agency that serves this population is exhausted and underfunded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| and so they don't have enough energy to make the one more call or to keep staffing in a way that they can work after hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| and transfer a person who needs resources here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| I just think we need a dedicated day center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and so if that opportunity arises as part of Ms. Reed's strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| I would really like to make sure that there's funding available for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| That's all for me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Council Member Hesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| I do intend to support this budget, but I know Boyce really wants to talk to me today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| Don't you, buddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Well, you can pass it on to Ketra and say she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| For the people who didn't get the pleasure of spending eight or ten hours with you the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| could you just explain that we're dipping into the unassigned fund balance to the tune of $15 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| And that normally doesn't happen, so do we anticipate this for next year or ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| I don't anticipate it for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| I mean, you know, you take year by year and you do some planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| but, yeah, this time it's going to be going from $45.2 million down to $30.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| with the use of $15 million unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| But the thing to remember is that that $30.2 million is still a million and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1908)|
| 0:31:57| $1.7 million above like what our past four-year average has been of $28.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| So, you know, it's not something you want to do every year, but we're still in fine shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| And, again, you've got 20% of the general fund set aside in that stabilization account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| 5% set aside in the assigned fund balance as part of best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| So, I mean, we're doing fine, and that was all the preponderance of that goes toward capital is what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| And a lot of it is there's things that we had started on that we needed to take through to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| So that's what that's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| But, no, I don't see that happening in perpetuity or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Okay, so back to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| I'm worried that we're not working to hit our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| If we look back to the ordinance, it requires that we invest $1.5 million in permanent supportive housing each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1982)|
| 0:33:12| There is not $1.5 million indicated in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| I think it's $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| I'm going to continue and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| That's a major concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| When talking about the finances, our regular, our salary increase for all city staff was paid by property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2011)|
| 0:33:47| but that will run out in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It will no longer cover the salary increase in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| But now the projections are that other local taxes will be able to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| It worries me because we also have other additional increased costs to cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| and we have additional salary increases to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| So that does not seem sustainable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| What are the other issues that I had with this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| Those are the main two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Those are the main two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I'll stop there because there are more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Well, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I was wrapping up my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| So those are my main concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| There are definitely more concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| There are not many positives to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| I'm trying to think of what I would highlight as a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| But I'm really struggling to find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I'm very much focused on what funds we are identifying for expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2120)|
| 0:35:30| reoccurring expenses that not only impact this budget but future budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| That's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And the other concern is the ordinances that city council adopts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| should influence this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| So if we have a commitment to Title VI and to adopting programs in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2147)|
| 0:35:57| that will address our anti-discrimination commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| when I look in the budget and I see that work largely underneath the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| Human Resources Department, which is a brand-new department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and I see that that department is very overwhelmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| has had over 80% turnover rate for the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| it doesn't show me that the city is taking that issue seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| or is investing in that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| When I get complaints and hear concerns from our disabilities coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| and I hear that decisions about disability issues are going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| Human Resources Department before they go to our number one expert here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| the city, and that actually has resulted in the city being sued last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| for how we treat our police officers with disabilities and losing that suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| and we're not addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| It brings me concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| There are many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Just as one of the speakers said earlier, you know, this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| a budget process shows you the priorities of a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| And we have major priorities to address that aren't being addressed by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| budget, like the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| I have questions around violence intervention that have come up since our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| last discussion, since the last public forum on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| I have concerns when it comes to the traffic calming that I believe that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| need to discuss as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I have lots of concerns about what's in this budget and what's not in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| budget, and especially when it comes to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| I've heard from multiple people that we can do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I agree that when it comes to those at the lower end of income, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| investing it and we're not getting those assurances during the budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| process that those commitments will be made, that over the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| over the last four budget cycles, 21, 22, 23, 24, that we're committing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2324)|
| 0:38:54| $1.5 million to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2334)|
| 0:39:15| And I was asked when coming to this meeting, what amendments would I propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| for the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And, you know, I had to remind them that we have a process, including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| language that's now in this ordinance, authorizing the administration to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2371)|
| 0:39:40| re-appropriate non-project-related encumbrances at the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| We really have removed city council from this process, any sort of oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| any sort of involvement, any ability to amend or make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| Because even if we make an amendment and we move money from one budget line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| to the other, they can just make up the difference at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| So we just, we really need a better budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| I just want to take a moment, I want to thank those who spoke as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And just to be perfectly honest, I wish we could do it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I wish we had unlimited funds where we could do it all and meet all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| needs of everything that we have going on in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Unfortunately, that's just not the case without exponentially raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| taxes or finding dollars in other spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| What I do want to say, the commitment to housing, I think we are moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| I think that there are a lot of moving pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I also want to recognize a group here today who has been advocates and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| have been, I want to say watchdogs in a sense, and that's Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| And thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| And, Mayor, for your commitment because of this group, I think when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| were campaigning, you made some commitments to this group that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| upheld to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Housing is a basic need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| It is a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| And I think we as a city have to continue on this trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| I don't know if Mr. Bentley is here today or not, but if you could come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| the podium and maybe, I know I'm catching you off guard, but if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| maybe give us an estimate of the affordable housing specifically from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Section 8 perspective that we have projected coming online in 2024 going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| into 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Yes, so Ben Bentley, KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| There are a couple of different sources of Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| One is the voucher program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| So I'm going to paint in broad strokes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Vouchers, there's about 4,200 vouchers that serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Knox County at any given point, so we're funded through HUD for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Those are predominantly individual property owners, so they're spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| throughout everybody's neighborhood in the room has probably some voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| families that live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Second source, there's about 4,000 units of KCDC-owned Section 8 project-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| rental assistance, so that's like First Creek at Austin, Western Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Lonsdale, all of the properties that you all are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| There are also new project-based vouchers that are Section 8 contracts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| properties, so some of them are the aforementioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| There's some of those units at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| There's some of them at Young High Flats, Moss Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| There are a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| So Holston River Park, I may not be getting that name right, but the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| right across from the park there, that is a Dominion deal that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| project-based Section 8 vouchers in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| There's one right off of Merchant, kind of at Pleasant Ridge and Merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Grosvenor, I always mess up the name, but that's what that one's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| There's quite a few coming online that will have Section 8 project-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| voucher contracts, which do serve the extremely low-income families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| so those are subsidized and the rent flows and moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| with the income of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Does that make any sense, what I've just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Is there any guesstimate on the number of units that are projected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| I think the ones across from Holston River Park, is that either 80 to 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Yeah, so one of those developments is about, at the ballpark that you're saying is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| 80 to 90, the Merchant and the Holston, and I get those flip-flopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| and the other one I think is about 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| So about 250 total between those two developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| There's also, and this is anecdotal, I don't have a number in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Callahan Flats, which you all have supported, has some permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| housing embedded with that, so there are project-based vouchers at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Caswell Manor, there are countless examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| but I think we can get a number of those Section 8 voucher contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| that are coming online to Council, if that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Definitely, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| And then also, someone mentioned the joint workshop on housing and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| I think that we have to keep that on the forefront as far as looking at the day space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| where people do have an avenue to be able to go somewhere to get help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and stay on that path to becoming housed within themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| Also, for the firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| I think that we're going to have to revisit that conversation at some point as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| as it relates to even with the EMT status, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| The gentleman, you know, and I appreciate him having worked 72 hours and cut grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| and then to be here just to speak to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| That's a lot of commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| and so I think that all of our men and women in uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| we're just going to have to find those dollars at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| And just something that we spoke about in our employee rep meeting is the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| that we have to continue to keep our pledge on the compensation studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| both comprehensive ones that are scheduled to happen in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| but also just ongoing market studies like we did when engineering was having a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| with being way below market for some of their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| So just wanted to thank Council Members who were able to make the time to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| Boyce Evans and Ketron Smith to understand that our revenues are able to cover this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| and salary increases for the upcoming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| That's, you know, we anticipate that to not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And also just wanted to say that thanks to Justice Knox and thanks to this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| we have committed to a minimum of $5 million a year towards affordable housing, a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| And every year, this city, with the support of this council, has exceeded that minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| and this budget is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| This contains $8 million towards affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| including over $3 million towards homeless prevention and emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| and permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| If everyone with Justice Knox could raise their hands just to thank you for your advocacy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| I don't think we would have that commitment in writing, but for your support and persistence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| And so thank you for continuing to show up and help be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| So I just wanted to mention that, and then I'll turn it over to Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| I was like, I thought you were going to mention something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Well, I learned that I could have met with Ketron, and I only got Boyce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| so I feel like I got shortchanged, but I enjoyed meeting with Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Just teasing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| A couple of other council members have mentioned it, so Justice Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I will also say thank you as well for the, I don't know if it was called a workshop or the joint housing meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| It was a summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you so much for working and making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| I felt like that was incredibly informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| It really could be boiled down to two key factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| What that lady came and talked about was low barrier shelter is a must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| and a day shelter service is a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And I moved here from Indianapolis and actually volunteered in a day shelter there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and it's really part of a, it's a critical part of the services that have to happen to help people get employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| keep employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| I worked at a shift there where it was like 4 to 8 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| and it was people who were employed who needed to have showers and services and mail and access to computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| and that is at the end of their work day or before an evening shift or before they went to a camp or a shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2872)|
| 0:48:00| or a halfway house, and we are really lacking in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| And that speaker that you brought in was adamant that until we do those things, those are the secret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| is low barrier shelter, and so I am incredibly sad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| and I know that it is not the fault of the budget per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| It's a lack of service providers and someone willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| or able to meet the requirements of the funding and provide the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| but it is really critical that we bring back a low barrier shelter however we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| I felt like that was one step that we'd made in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| and we were able to get that open right as COVID hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| and a few beds for spacing got lost in the mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and it was able to stay open for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| and so it's really important to me that we keep that at the forefront of our viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| because we've got to get that back to be able to make progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| So thank you guys for continuing to work on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Mayor, you touched on compensation studies for employees and the ongoing efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| so I don't know if it's you or Boyce or if Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Dr. Drummond is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| If Dr. Drummond is here, I cannot see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| She is here, our director of HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Dr. Drummond, could you come to the podium and let council know about the compensation studies that we've committed to doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| Can you talk about the ongoing efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| You know, we get questions from employees at budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| and we have concerns from employees about different aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| So what are the ongoing efforts, and when do the compensation studies happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| and when does it happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Can you give us better information about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Dr. Kelly Drummond with the Human Resource Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| Every year, once we have the initial compensation study, we are doing benchmarking annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| But on the fifth year, we will do a full compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| So last year, department heads reached out and said their issues or concerns about specific positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| and we did a benchmarking study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| In addition to that, we looked at police and what was going on with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| For the new year, we will look at KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| There are some issues with compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| And so we've already spoken to the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and we will look specifically at their pay and pay issues with compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| And then we will also open it up to general government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| So it's an ongoing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| It's not, oh, it's been seven years, it's time for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| In the past, it was done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| But you all, as city council, approved when we did the initial compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| and we made the major pay changes, and with the step change, was to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| And actually in ordinance, we must do it within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| And throughout those five years, we are doing benchmarking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| So we are looking at it annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| You're looking at neighboring comparable cities within our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| And then also, a comment was made about employees or post-compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| and where in the range people were paid weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| After the compensation study, wasn't the goal to get people to midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| not necessarily the bottom of their range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| When we look at the pay band is what you're talking about, that grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| what we needed to look at was what was the initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| what was actually the midrange for the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| And we got everybody in all of those positions, if you remember a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| we got all of those individuals to a basic range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Now, with the 2.5% that we are asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| we move up the pay grade or that band by 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| So what you will find is that individuals will no longer be always at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| That's what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| where individuals will always be at the starting point of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| By doing 2.5%, everyone gets an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| but the pay band increases by 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| It assures that everyone moves up in the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| But at the end of that five-year study, we have looked at other positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| and we will continue to look if there are any positions that are significantly out of pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| and we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| But at the end of the five years, we will do a whole comprehensive study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| which includes all of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| I just wanted to clarify with the affordable housing study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| because I feel like we keep having these really unproductive conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| where it's like, no, we're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| No, we're not doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I'm saying I would like to be able to track what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| And so when we approve a project, I want to be able to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| okay, in this budget year, FY24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| we approved, let's say, $8 million in funding for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| That went to XYZ projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| It produced XYZ number of units of housing in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Now, that housing might not be built out and ready for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| but we know in that year we put money towards 400 units of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| And then the next year we can put money towards another 400 units of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| But when we get a snapshot that goes all the way back to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| it doesn't help me gauge whether we are following the policy that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| When I tried to look at what projects have come before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| not including Austin East, I mean, Austin Homes and Transforming Western,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3256)|
| 0:54:24| I only counted around 594 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| But even within that, it's hard for me to go in and break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| which units are for 30% income and below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| which units are for 60% income and below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| which units are, you know, 100% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| That's what we need to be able to see in order to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| if the ordinance that we adopted is being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| It would also help us understand where are some gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| because we continue to hear from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| especially in, you know, those making under $30,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| that they can't find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| They're losing housing and they can't find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And the, oh, I don't have the numbers in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| but I think when I looked up HUD pricing for one bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| of someone making, you know, under $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| it was more around $600 a month for 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And I am not seeing any projects come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| that are allowing rent at that price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| I keep seeing projects come before us that are at $800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| $1,000, $1,200 per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| and that's supposed to be an affordable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| I would like to know more about the work being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| to identify units of housing for these different income levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| so that we can make sure those investments are being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| in the way that we approve through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| That would be a huge improvement, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| for me to be able to say to the public what we are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| how we're doing it, and just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| that we are addressing the affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Right now, it does feel like more units are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| on that higher end, and there's even discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| in this packet about competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| competition over inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| which just doesn't line up with my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Those who are making $15,000 and less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| are not really competing with those making $80,000 and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| They have different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| They have different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| they're looking for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| The folks making over $80,000 and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| if the housing can't meet a certain standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| those are folks who are more likely to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| or have a longer commute, but they have more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| The folks at the lower end have fewer options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| and so that's why I continue to try to stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| that that's where our priority has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| also because those at the higher end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| even though the inventory might not be there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| that's a price point that the market can address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| The lower end will not be addressed by the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| So that, in my opinion, continues to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| where we have to focus our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I would love to get an updated report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| that gave us a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| of when the projects were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| what was approved, at what income level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| so that we know each year how many units of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and for who we are approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Ms. Parker, I know there's a lot of investments going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| in the city that we hope to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| more investments in housing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and I do want to, again, thank council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| who have made the time to speak to our finance team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| to speak to our housing and neighborhood development director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| Our staff is available to help walk you through these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| so you can understand it as fully as you have time to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| But I do want to just say that we are committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| to increasing the supply of housing at all price points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| but particularly for our most needy people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| unsheltered, homeless people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| people with very, very low incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And this council is investing $26.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| at Transforming Western to complement a $40 million HUD grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| So a HUD, $40 million, that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| The city's putting in $26.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| and that is also complementing other sources of private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| to the tune of over $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| So we have metrics that Director DuBose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| can give a summary of in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| So we have quantitative metrics that are open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| and, of course, to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| and we hope to continue to improve the accessibility of those dashboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| However, it's also important to have that qualitative information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| and I had the opportunity to go spend several hours walking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and talking to the people who live in Western Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| and those who've had the opportunity to move from the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| that are going to be raised and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| replaced with new housing and more units of top-quality housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| They're already moved to the refurbished housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| and the homes look beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| and the people who have moved in feel...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Literally, I said I feel like a rich person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| I feel like the transformation's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| It's the infrastructure, it's the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| it's the high-quality transformation of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| and we're just in the beginning phases of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| So, Kevin, I mean, Mr. DuBose, Director DuBose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| could you share with council some more of the metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| that you and your team are putting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| how we can make sure that we're directing our investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| towards those who need the most help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Kevin DuBose, Housing and Neighborhood Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| I want to make sure that I point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| that there were two documents released 90 days of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| One is our annual affordable housing report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| This one is required by our affordable housing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| and it gives a detailed report on that year's activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| And I'll just mention briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| the last report highlighted the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| that were funded in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Central Terrance, which was 112 units and 28 accessible units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| Callaghan Flats, 32 and three-bedroom multifamily units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| in addition to the permanent support of the housing, 80 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Five points infield, which were larger units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| scattered site and five points, which are 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| It also gives a cumulative report on how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| We've invested $26.9 million in three budget years prior to this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| in the affordable housing fund, which, as the mayor mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| is far ahead of our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| It was also mentioned that our permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| budget number of $1.1 million this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| is different than the $1.5 million commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| and there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We spent more in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| We committed $2.9 million for permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| to contribute to Callaghan Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| And the $1.1 million is just the amount needed to keep us on pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| So we are on pace with our commitment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| And I also will point out we're very proud of our record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| the shocking numbers of $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| $26.9 million coming from the affordable housing fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| $40 million invested in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| in over 2,000 units is the numbers that we've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| We've also been saying that we've leveraged over $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Now, if you take the projects that were approved by the last council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| and subtract them from the report that you're reading from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| that number is still true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| because the numbers were much higher than we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| This report here, the affordable housing report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| which I should mention the official name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Attainable Resilient Knoxville Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| has a comprehensive picture of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| from an affordable housing and attainable housing perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| And I'm a planner, so how I do this is I look back five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| and I hit 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| So the 2019 numbers were going back to explain our progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| And I will report that the 10-year period between 2011 and 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| 2022, we averaged about 800 units a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Last year we were at 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| The year before that we were at 1,344.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| So our trajectory in terms of our housing production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| is headed to doubling our 10-year pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| So we're adding lots and lots of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Thank you, Mr. DuBose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| This report that you're referring to, has it been shared with council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Yes, I put a copy in everyone's hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| I don't believe I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| If you could resend it to me, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Before council, and then also it's published on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Could you get me another copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| I do not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| And, Mr. DuBose, maybe just resend the link to where it's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| Anyone in the public can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| And also, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| if you want Mr. DuBose to go over it with you in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| he's available to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Motion carries 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| 9B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| real, personal, and mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| within the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| to provide sufficient revenues to fund the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| and debt service fund operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| and debt service obligations of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| and ending June 30, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Council members, we have three people signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| First is Detective Jason Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3964)|
| 1:06:14| Jason Booker, 1615 Huron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you for letting me speak on this matter again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| And I've talked about some of our low numbers when I was up here a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| So if you look at the 69 officers, we're short now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| so that equals out to about 10 patrol squads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| That actually has a trickle-down or a trickle-up effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Either way you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Because with these low numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| that literally affects everything that KPD does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| It affects our patrol functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| It affects the folks that call in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| and would like to report nonviolent crimes over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| It affects SRO staffing at schools within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| It even affects the detectives working on homicide investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| In order to continue to address our issues with violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| we must work towards repairing the recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| and retention problems in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| This is not something that's special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| or that's just landed in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| This is industry-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| And so this affects law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| all over the country of various sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| I know each of you recognizes the tremendous responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| that KPD has in dealing with crime in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| and keeping our citizens and visitors safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| With you guys meeting these issues of staffing head-on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| we as a city can continue to ensure Knoxville is a great place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| to live, work, visit, and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| By passing these measures associated with the proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| you can fix the problems that have been years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| And you guys didn't have anything to do with these problems where we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| But you can take a step and fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Next person signed up to speak to Item 9B is Zoe Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Ms. Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| Zoe Scott, Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| In the interest of respecting Council's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| and not repeating myself too many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| I'll just say that this is an important measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| to set the tax rate necessary to fund the proposed operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| that this body just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| And in support of this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| we also encourage you to support this ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| And the third and final person signed up to speak in favor of Item 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| is Reverend John Mark Wiggers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| I'm John Mark Wiggers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| I live at 3704 Garden Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| And I serve as a priest at St. James Episcopal Church in the 1-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| And so I come tonight representing Justice Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| who's been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| We consider the Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| one of our five-year overnight successes in achieving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| as we were advocating for that, for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| And we thank you that there was a response to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| and for the continued work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| And so we want to speak in favor of positively funding those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| In particular, we applaud the continued funding for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| We support naming and implementing reliable and consistent funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| And this crisis of affordable housing has come up again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| in the house meetings that our organization holds every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| as people report to us the difficulty they have, their families have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| of finding affordable and safe places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| And Justice Knox, as you know, has studied the efforts of other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| and we found that initiatives like this Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| have a positive impact in providing affordable housing for members of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| And those funds can't just be applied in the short term to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| They must be in place for the long haul so that people like firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| and law enforcement officers, teachers, nurses, retail workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| some pastors, city employees, to name a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| can also afford to live in the city where they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| In Justice Knox, we support these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| that will fund affordable housing initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| And we also understand that this funding, as has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| is going toward efforts to address homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| We asked for that summit, and we were glad that the mayors came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| to host that summit, that joint summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| We're proud to bring Julie Orlando, who was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| who comes from Bergen County, New Jersey, where they've had great success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| as some of the issues were mentioned by our vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| of the things that are needed to make that successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| We know it's not a cookie cutter, but there's a recipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and there are certain ingredients that need to be in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| to make those efforts successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| At our last annual assembly that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| where we had nearly 1,200 of our members of the over 20 congregations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| that we represent who were there, Mayor Kincannon was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| and we asked her and Mayor Jacobs and Aaron Reid to continue to consult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| with Ms. Orlando from Bergen County, New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| to lean on those resources of those folks who have done successful work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and learn from them what it takes to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| So we definitely support funding those efforts to help house our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| We appreciate that there is data forthcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| and we will continue to ask for data along those points of who's being served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| because we realize that safe, affordable housing is better for all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| It creates better health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| It helps our students get better education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| It keeps us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| It supports our businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| At our summit, it was great not only to see service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| help the homeless, but there were businesses there realizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| that they were seeing needs and how this impacts their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| and the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| We realize that this is a comprehensive need to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| and we're excited to see that there have been efforts to draw in private funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| and we know that that takes hard work of the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| to go and educate folks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| And we stand ready to continue to educate our congregations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Nearly 10,000 members across our 20-plus congregations to educate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| that things like permanent supportive housing actually work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| and it can work in their neighborhood, in our neighborhoods where we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| and that these efforts to provide affordable housing work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| to make our city safer and a great place to live for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| So thank you for recognizing Justice Knox and our work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| and we'll continue to be here to advocate for these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| and we support this budget before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Council, that concludes the people signed up to speak on Item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| There are two comments I wanted to make following up on the public speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| and some of the comments made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| We have folks working to serve individuals experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| all around our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| and many of them come together monthly as a part of the Homeless Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| to identify priorities in the community for this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| These are the folks that I look to for answers on lots of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| and I would hope that those who are also organizing on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| would look to that community for answers and guidance and support on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| because we have to recognize when we have political power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| but we're not necessarily those closest to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| And that's what I'm starting to see, this dynamic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| What I'm seeing are people struggling all around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| to serve this very vulnerable population, and they all need resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| They're all points of contact for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| They're all, for some, the closest point of safety that they could get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| I'm worried about this discussion I'm hearing about this centralized location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| and I hope that there's more discussion before those with political power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| move full steam ahead with an idea because they have the political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| That's what I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I hope our community will collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| and will work with those most close to the issue on what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| It also really throws me off when we have a discussion about the shortage in KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4495)|
| 1:15:06| when it seems we have at least a dozen officers here tonight, maybe 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| I haven't counted everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| If I go out into the hallway, I see another handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| How, with our shortages, do you all have the ability to send so many officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| And it's not just this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| The last meeting we had a lot of officers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| To me, that makes it difficult to argue because based on what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| we got two squads in the building tonight, and I don't even know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| I'm sure there are other departments who would love to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| and advocate for pay increases and additional funding for their department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| but I wonder if they have the capacity to send people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| So that's just one thing I wanted to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Let's make sure, those of us committed to justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| that we are centering the voices of those who are closest to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| and that we're not using our political power for a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Motion carries 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| 9C is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Sections 2-449, 2-450, 2-458,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| and 2-459 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| to adjust the classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| Council members Detective Booker and Zoe Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| have signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| If you want to, Mr. Booker, come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| and Ms. Scott, you may too, if you don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| if you've said what you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| I appreciate the time, and I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| This will be the last time you guys hear from me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| As of today, these numbers are very fresh, and so they are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| We have 13 officers on the drop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| which means they have established their retirement date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| and they have made a clear decision to retire within the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| We currently have 51 officers that are eligible to retire today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and not come back tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| They can just call in and say, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| They've reached that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Not that I'm not going to call in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| but I'm one of the guys that's reached that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Eleven more officers will be eligible to retire in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| and 26 more can retire within three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| Taking all those into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| KPD could lose over 100 officers within the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| To put it into perspective, the exit numbers versus our incoming numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| we currently have seven recruits in the academy that will graduate in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| After that, they face another more than four months in training in the FTO program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| Then we have another 13 recruits that will graduate in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| and after they graduate, they face another four months in the FTO program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| Although recruitment is a major issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| focus should probably be given at this point on the retention of senior officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| and the detectives who possess decades of experience and institutional knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Adjusting the pay plans and current classifications will be a great step in addressing retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| and will assist in attracting quality applicants to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| I want to thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Nothing about this is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| I know sometimes these things are not a very popular political decision that you have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| but I appreciate your time and effort in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| If you guys need me for anything, you can get a hold of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| I'll be happy to talk to you about the ins and outs of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| or any of these issues that I've talked to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Ms. Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Councilmembers, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| People have signed up to speak to Item 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Yeah, I just wanted clarification on a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| Right now we're voting on changes to the compensation and classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| and the preceding agenda items were about the tax rate and the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| And this is, I think, my seventh budget maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I get one more unless something happens to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| So in all of my experience being here, I'm pretty familiar with seeing a lot of city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| and uniformed employees who come to the budget because, you know, it's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4787)|
| 1:19:56| It revolves around your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| So I'm curious, are there, and one thing was made about counting police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| and numbers of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Deputy Chief Powell, aren't many of these folks here on their own time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| They're not all on duty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| It's hard to differentiate because there are other employees here that are also not during their work hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| They're here on their off time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| They don't get compensated leave or anything for the time they come to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| It's just their choice to come here and be part of these proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Yes, ma'am, that's correct, their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Okay, not just KPD but other departments as well that work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I'm assuming, I know there's some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Mr. Henkel, I believe you said you're off duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Okay, so I just, I don't like the idea of making assumptions as to who's here on the clock and off the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| And so just for the public that's watching and for the public that's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| people are here off the clock because they're, you know, concerned about their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| And I just think that that's a fair thing to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| I would love more clarification then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| We have multiple officers in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| I think they're all working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| I would love to know how many officers here who are working and how many here are on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| If we're going to clarify, let's clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| As you know, we have had some recent council meetings where I and other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4888)|
| 1:21:36| and we needed some extra security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| And so just like when the community calls 911 and they need help from police or fire, they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| Even if they're short-staffed, they find a way to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| So in recent weeks, we have had extra police here at some of our council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| Some are here on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Some are here to help make sure everybody here feels safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| I'm not going to ask them to differentiate that at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Well, then let me finish my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Because my point is is that we do have multiple, I don't know how many I counted earlier back in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| It was about nine uniformed officers who have been showing up regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| I called today to see who had signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Once I heard the names, I knew there would be no protest tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| So I don't understand why we can't plan and understand that we don't have to show up, have KPD show up in full force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4954)|
| 1:22:45| even when there's no protest being planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Ms. Parker, maybe you can let us know since you seem to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| You can call and get the list of public forum speakers just like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| That's easy enough to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| It seems like a waste of their time and a waste of city tax dollars to have so many officers here every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4976)|
| 1:23:06| While we're hearing about the extreme shortages, it seems that they have more important things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| It's unfortunate that folks have felt unsafe when we've had really young protesters showing up in flip flops to talk about what they're not happy about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=4993)|
| 1:23:27| That could be something for us to address ourselves so that we don't waste city tax dollars having a room full of police officers when it's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5007)|
| 1:23:37| Now, if y'all wanted to clarify who's in the room, let's clarify who's in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| I don't know why y'all are getting aggravated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| If folks are here to keep us safe, that's a conversation to have because it's at a level that we hadn't seen prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5023)|
| 1:23:51| And that costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| And we're talking about money for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| And my complaint is, I think it's a very valid complaint, that we have numerous paid on-duty police officers at our meetings while we are considering the shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5037)|
| 1:24:12| And that, to me, does not make that a convincing argument when they can easily bring a squad to our meetings when it's not even needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5052)|
| 1:24:26| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Now, asking if there are some people here off-duty does not negate my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5073)|
| 1:24:41| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Well, I'll turn it over to Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Just to interject in the conversation that, yes, we have seen an increase in officers for the last, gosh, maybe month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5093)|
| 1:25:05| We know that tensions are running high, and rightfully so, on a lot of the issues that we're hearing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| People are coming to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| People do have a right to public protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| And I don't think that the increased security was specifically around those folks who were signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| But just even on the aspect of public safety, I do know that we did have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| And you can't not predict the numbers of who is going to show up in peaceful protest or if the protest will turn at any given time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| because these are very passionate and very personal issues that people are here to protest and to express themselves about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5138)|
| 1:25:50| whether they speak at the podium or just in the audience or outside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| So I, in my opinion, I see that as public safety, not necessarily for council and staff, but for the general public who attend here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5156)|
| 1:26:07| And to be perfectly honest, yeah, there was someone who said something threatening as I was walking out of this room probably about a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5167)|
| 1:26:18| I would prefer not to take that into my own hands but to allow law enforcement to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| because if I take it into my own hands, law enforcement will probably get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| and I'm not trying to be on that end of law enforcement if someone is threatening toward me and doing something to my property or my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| Because I think that we all have that, I think, level of respect that people do have a right to protest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| but we also know that it can, when people are passionate, it can become volatile very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| And I see the increased security as a matter of public safety, not necessarily for council safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| And that's just my viewpoint. That could be totally different, but that's how I view it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| I just wanted to share that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie. Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Yeah. So we can't always predict people's behaviors when they're upset and when they're heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5227)|
| 1:27:17| And I'm going to really reel myself in here. I would love to tell the whole story, so if I'm pushed to, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5237)|
| 1:27:26| I do think it's a waste of resources to have this many officers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| but unfortunately things have happened at different times, not just in the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| not just associated with people protesting about a war that we all think is awful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| but we just don't agree with the resolutions that got brought forward, which is not germane to this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| But there was a time, one time, when someone waited for me at the back of the dais back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| to accost me and stalk me to my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| Could you get a line for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Okay. That must have been why they were in my face yelling at me the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| And I said, if you push me, I'll go the whole story. I'll go the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| Because the PBA video of you orchestrating it and watching, girl, I got clips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| I got clips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Let's focus on the class comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| The issue at hand is I appreciate having KPD to watch people's backs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| because that night there was no one from KPD back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| and Councilwoman Testerman was the one who stood up and watched out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| And anybody that wants to see the clips from the PBA videos of what happened is welcome to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5313)|
| 1:28:40| So people should behave themselves, even when you don't like what you hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| I'm glad all y'all are here. I'd like to vote on the compensation plans, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5327)|

| 1:37:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| Since our last meeting, I drove over to the area just to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| a little bit more time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Realized that I had a confused Yellowstone with Beeman Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| but very similar roads either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| And I wanted to speak to my comment that I made at our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| because it caught the attention of some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| When I said that I regretted my vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| I wanted to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| And please feel free to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| You don't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I'm planning to support this again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Just wanted to explain why I made that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| And the reason I made that statement is that changing a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| from single-family residential to R and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| has been a debated issue on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| And it really concerned me that there was very little discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| of this property changing to R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| It was nothing compared to other properties that we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| getting such a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| And when we moved on to the next issue, which was West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| the language for me was almost intolerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| about wanting to support the neighborhood's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| when we were just talking about a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| And none of that came up when we had community members here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| from Beeman Lake who were worried about their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| going from single-family to R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| Not just a duplex, but R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| And we had no one here advocating for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| And that's what bothered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I still am pushing for the city to evaluate the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| to see what support could be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| I'm trying to think about my own criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| that I'll use moving forward for these types of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Should an R and 5 only be on a road with lines on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=5993)|
| 1:40:03| If it's essentially a one-lane road with no lines on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| should we put that much density on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| We need some sort of criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| And I've also been talking with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| because we've got this North Shore debacle coming our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| And my question, in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| it's an area of town that's more well-to-do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| and so they have a road study going on out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| that they can reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| But we don't have those types of studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| to look at in this area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| And so trying to get a better understanding of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| when planning staff, not commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| but planning staff recommend one development but not another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| I'm trying to get an understanding of what their criteria is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| Do they go out to the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Do they do a count of the cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Or is it just based on what that definition of the street is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| So it's something that I have to think through for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| in terms of my own criteria in these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| But I do support this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| with the city making a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| to infrastructure needs in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| But we've got to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| I just challenge us as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| to give the same care to every neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| not just the ones that have a lot of political power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| and they can show up and make us sweat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| but also the ones who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| they love and they care about their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| they don't have the lawyers and the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| and the folks who can do the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| and the lawyers and the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| and the folks who can show up who are a part of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| to argue against certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| And that will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| just not so easily put an R in five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| in a single family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| simply because it's not West Hills or Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| or one of the hills, that tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| Okay, seeing no further lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6134)|

| 1:43:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I'm sorry, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Daniel Smith is here to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Mr. Smith, if you could state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| A physical address or a zip code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| Whatever you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| I actually know where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| I know where you live too, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Yes, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| He's my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| I'm Daniel Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| My nickname is Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| I live at Knoxville High Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| And just to take the edge off things, not on this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| I'm happy to say I've been a volunteer chaplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| with the Knoxville Police Department for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| And the chaplains are not in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| Okay, on the $90,000, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| Is council aware of the ratio of the $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| to the total budget of the VEC Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| And does a three-year option mean that VEC Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| gets the $90,000 for three more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| without it having to come to city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| And by the way, I'm a fan of VEC Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| I've been going there since Bob Booker, rest in peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| was the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| And it is a fascinating place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| and you really can't see it in just a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| I guess I'll stand here and wait to see what the answers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Mr. Smith, we appreciate your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| and then council can discuss that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| and we can answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| during the course of their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Okay, so I can sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Council members, and I think Reverend Kessler is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| if you have questions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| But just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| we, the city, have been supporting the VEC Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| for many years, and it has often in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| been done through a community agency grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| But similar to the way we do with some other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| who do services for us that are just so essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| to the city and to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| we worked with them to do this on a contractual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| rather than asking them to apply for the grant each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| So that is the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| but the amount of money in our pledge of support is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| and I just want to say the VEC Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| has been an amazing contributor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| to so many elements of our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| including just helping us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| the more recent past of urban renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| and the impact that it's had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| the negative impact it's had on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| So that's just a little background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Council member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| The gentleman asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| would this grant come back before us every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| It would or would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| The contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| No, this agreement would be dependent upon funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| being approved in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| but the agreement, as long as the funding was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| would be renewed every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| and it wouldn't have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| every single year to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Okay, that's what I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| because we have the word contract there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| and I don't think it would be any different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| from any other agency that we would contract with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| so I just wanted that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| to award a total amount not to exceed $247,855| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| in historic preservation program grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| to support property improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| to eligible historic properties within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Yeah, I think this is either replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| or using funds that were historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| for a facade grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| Can you talk about how these funds are used differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| or how the city plans to adapt its use of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| for those situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Historically, there are two programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| One is the facade and the other is affectionately known as HPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| Historic preservation is the goal for the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| Different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| The facade is limited at $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| The historic preservation, there is not a limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| because it was created to solve the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| of demolition by neglect of historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| culturally significant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| within urban neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| And so we've, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| been able to help preserve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| What you have today before you is the HPP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| which is going to change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| But right now, as it is, we have these two requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| for funding that we're recommending approval for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| And how will it change in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Well, we'll be working with Urban Design and Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| on a new process similar to the public-private partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| which will get more eyes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| and more collaboration between the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6534)|

| 1:52:00| with the multitude of school safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| that have popped up over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| which have highlighted the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| for further clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| about the relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| Sheriff's Department, Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| and I think I saw on this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| that schools are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| the school department is listed as a sub-recipient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| and I think it's kind of gone back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| on previous requests, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| But that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| a Department of Justice grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| for this city to be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| within the city limits of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| for training for SROs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| we need to know what we're getting for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| And I don't care where the money's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| But we need to know what we're getting for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Well, we know the recent history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| of some schools in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| a lot of schools in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| and in particular I'm going to reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| the death of Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| And what training was going on before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| So that we had a clear knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| and an understanding of what the relationship is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| between KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| the SRO position within the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Knox County School System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| what the protocols are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| so that there would be this ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| to avoid having young people killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| in a school bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| And, you know, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| if you're not going to have accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| if you're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| if we're going to have armed people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| enforcing within and coming to get children in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| yes, he had a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| I'll just get that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| That's what always pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| He shouldn't have had a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| But there are other needs that could have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| you could have put resources toward if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| because repeatedly what I've heard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| that the city of Knoxville is no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| in the school business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| And actually this grant points that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| You're not in the school business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| You're in the enforcement business for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| So the mindset says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| at the end of the day, let's come and get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| If we think they're messing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| let's come and get them and take them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| Or let's lock them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| But let's not educate them, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| And that's the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| Listen, we had multiple children from Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| killed in the community, literally all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| Some of them died over in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| but they were students at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| Yet, we screamed and hollered for more security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| And we got just the opposite, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| And the way it was handled, I want there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| to be some protocols in place that says, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| And the city of Knoxville, in combination, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| you're not in the school business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| but you can do by obligating and prioritizing funding for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| hmm, send some money over to the county school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| to have counselors or support a partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| just like you're doing now on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| with the federal government, Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| maybe to supply counselors, psychologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Never done that before, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| So think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Think about your mindset and what you're mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| about communities from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| Keep that in mind, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| It doesn't matter what you learn if you don't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| Any other questions or comments on Item 11E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| Well, I'll just add to that comment that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| what our public speaker said in many ways is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| in that this funding has become available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| and it has created a program that we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| because the funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| But we don't necessarily stop to assess whether we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| to make changes and whether we need to invest as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| not just as a school system, but as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| and community-based mental health workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| school-based mental health workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| and move away from the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| that we traditionally provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| I wonder, Mayor, if you don't mind me asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| at one point you had considered removing SROs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| from the city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| With making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| was there consideration of other ways that we could support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| the school through counselors or other positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| other than school resource officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| Well, as your colleague, Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| mentioned earlier this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| we pass along something along the lines of $172 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| of our sales tax collections to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| which is something like $50 million more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| than what's required by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| and we welcome them to use that towards things like counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| After serving for 10 years on the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| I'm well aware that the school board is the governing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| over Knox County Schools, and we need to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| but it's ultimately their decision on how to spend the monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| that come to their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| It's projected to be $176 million, a little over that, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Thank you, $176 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| Is there anyone in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| who would proactively look for funding for other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| or is that not something that we are doing as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| when it comes to the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| If the school system has identified an entity from, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| the federal government that would be willing to grant funds for counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| we'd be happy to partner with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| but I'm sure to the extent that that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| they would use the Knox County Health Department to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| The reason this grant goes through us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| is because it's from the Department of Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| and we don't have the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| That's a county function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| I'm curious about our role in the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| and it does feel funder-driven, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| because it's money through the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| That brings the city of Knoxville into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| If this were a health department grant, it would not bring the city into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| And I think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| I think it's reasonable for a community to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| kind of funder-driven initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| I plan on supporting this tonight because it's the same grant as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| I did have a question about it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| There's language within this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| or within the resolution, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| and I wasn't sure if this appeared in previous resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| that authorized changes to be made to the grant throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7264)|
| 2:01:14| Is that the typical language that's been attached to this grant in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Assistant Chief Powell, do you know the answer to that question off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| If not, we can supply it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| I'll have to go back and gather that information and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| Yeah, that's the only thing that stood out to me is in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| there's language that states, you know, that now this is for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7296)|
| 2:01:58| This is F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| No, we're on E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| Let me point out that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| So it's a required local match of $125,000 for a total grant of $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| or in such other amounts or own such other terms as may be advantageous to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7339)|
| 2:02:27| to expand and improve security at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| Council Member Parker, we will ask KPD to get back to you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| They don't have that comparison with you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| And since your five minutes is up, I'm going to go to Ms. Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| and then we can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| If I could just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| So my question is, would this language allow the match of $120,000 to be higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7365)|
| 2:02:55| And you can answer me later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| If you know that off the top of your head, if you're not sure, then we can just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Yeah, I would need to confer with grants and see why there's a difference in the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| Or if there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Or if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| We'll confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| I mean, this is a grant that has come before this council every year since I've been mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| and probably many years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| I don't think there are any differences, substantive differences this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| but we'll confirm and get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| Yeah, so my question was also about clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| because a lot of times when we get these grant applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| they contain little information about what actually happens with the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| because it kind of passes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| Because specifically, I think Councilwoman Parker said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| the agenda item, the AIS, just says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| used for equipment, supplies, travel, and training for school violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| But not a lot of details about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| Look to Google for more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Knox News, there was a 2018 article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| and it shows examples of cameras bought for outside the doors of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| They show a camera system installed at the West High School door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| And it talks about training to prevent violence among students against other violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| or violence from students to other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| So I guess if someone could just follow up with us and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| where has it gone in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| This is a very common grant that we've done multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| It's not actually paying for labor or personnel, it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| It's paying for, like the old article discusses coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| so like I guess radio systems or early alert, describe one as early alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7478)|
| 2:04:45| So just what's it been used for in the past would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| We can ask Knox County Schools to share that information with Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| but we don't have it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| Ma'am, if I could, a lot of grants have that type language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7501)|

| 2:09:41| HLH must first rezone the property from its current low-density rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| to a higher density residential zoning, RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7786)|

| 2:09:55| Number one, the developer's commitment to fulfilling the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7795)|

| 2:10:28| properties that surround us are residential and the wishes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| neighborhood are to maintain a residential character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7834)|

| 2:10:43| adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Number six, access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Both Broome and Middlebrook have unique traffic challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| which we've been assured will be addressed at the proper time following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7851)|

| 2:11:00| Number seven, last concern is street lighting pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| We've requested that the developer work with the community to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| lighting coming into the neighborhood from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| and we've been assured that that would not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| Mr. Grodzewski stated it is too early to have answers to specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7879)|

| 2:11:37| So with that in mind, the biggest question for West Hills and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| neighbors is our confidence in the developer to fulfill their plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7901)|

| 2:13:07| Mr. Shuler cannot be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| He just asked that I express the same sentiment to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| and we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7992)|

| 2:13:17| Members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| I just want to thank the developer and the neighborhood for getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| together last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| I think this is just another highlight of how important it is to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| everybody get together because, you know, the neighborhood and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| property are always going to be neighbors for longer than any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| will be around to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| So I'm really glad that they all got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| I'm glad that the concerns of the neighborhood were addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| and they were restated by Mr. Hume here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| and that Mr. Caducey was able to give him some assurances about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| These are, you know, talking about a commitment to a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| You know, I think what the neighborhood is just saying there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| they're being presented with a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| and they want to have assurance that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| we're really trying to do this project that we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| And so I was glad in our conversations to hear the same kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| from you all as well, that you're doing similar projects, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| and that you've been committed to getting those done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| And, you know, just a commitment to quality of the product that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| going to end up with, that it's going to be in line with what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| neighborhood is expecting to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Seeing traffic concerns addressed, there are challenges on Broom Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| You know, there's certainly some consideration for some investments there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| that have been, you know, probably long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| But certainly as you get to where you're approaching Middlebrook there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| you end up with that hill that can make the turn blind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| and it just presents itself with a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| So in conjunction with this development, it would also be nice if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| you know, look into whether there's some improvements there that need to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| The natural buffer, you know, certainly the surrounding direct neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| I think having a natural buffer makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| And then just considerations for light pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| I mean, that's a normal concern whenever you're seeing something being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| next door to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| So I think all those are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| I just wanted to highlight this is a really great example of everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| getting together and having a conversation and coming up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| And also, you know, Middlebrook is, you know, one of our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| so certainly having some additional housing along our corridors is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| that not only I support, but I think everyone on council supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| And what I'm hearing from the neighbors is the dramatic support for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| So I think all in all this is a good story about everyone getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| and being able to work together on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| So I'm glad the neighborhood supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| And I think it's already been made a motion, so I'll just second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| Did you want to consolidate the items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Let me do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8191)|

| 2:16:42| and we'll just be able to vote on those once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8202)|

| 2:18:43| and aggregates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8323)|

| 2:18:52| recycling them so we can use them again as aggregate material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8332)|

| 2:19:46| I haven't heard any objections yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| It's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| If I hear objections between now and the second one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| we'll bring those to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| But I will be moving to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| I just wanted to clarify, and thank you for that additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| the buffer is one thing I wanted to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| But overall, I do have concerns about this area and the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| that's nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| And I'm sensitive to more heavy industrial being added to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| And one question, I'll go ahead and ask it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| is when we have rezoning requests like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| is there some sort of environmental impact assessment that's made to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8431)|
| 2:20:39| if too much heavy industrial is being added to an area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| Anyone from planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Or anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| Ms. Poirot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| You could just say, since you're new to some of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| if you could just share your name and position with Planning for Us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| I'm Michelle Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| I'm the Planning Services Manager with Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| I'm happy to be here on behalf of Planning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| So we do not do any direct environmental impacts of industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| overall for this city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| If there is an environmental use that's going to a different use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| then sometimes there's remediation and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| but we don't really look at that, particularly not for a rezoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| But there's not any studies like that that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| The motion for the consolidated items was made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Did someone second your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| Then all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| Now we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| First, we have four people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| The first is Ed Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| Mr. Patrick, if you could approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| and start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| This is the, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| The microphone's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| You're at the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| Ed Patrick, 37915 First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| Mayor, if you wouldn't mind giving me an oral heads up with 30 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| before the end of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8546)|
| 2:22:27| I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8547)|
| 2:22:28| Your five minutes starts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| I can't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8550)|
| 2:22:31| First of all, I want to say I apologize for extending the meeting even five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| minutes, but this issue has been gnawing at me, and I need to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Second of all, I'm sorry I missed it last week or last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| I was scheduled to appear, and I ran out of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| But this time I still have a little gas left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| So I want to say first that I drafted a resolution, a draft resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| for this council to consider on Gaza back in late last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| in November or December, and gave it to Mr. Johnson for distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| which I'm assuming he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Councilwoman Parker submitted a far better resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| And I felt that it was a legitimate exercise of the council's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| But when Councilman Vice then Councilman Smith articulated in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| typically elusive way why he was not going to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| I reflected that this was an issue where reasonable minds can differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| And I wanted to just establish the fact that I had submitted this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8618)|
| 2:23:46| resolution to establish my street creds with my young friends who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| aren't here tonight but who have been here and here and here and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| So on the merits, I agree with my young friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| But on the procedural aspect, since this was an issue where reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| minds can differ, I receded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| And I think now is the time to roll up our sleeves and do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| So the second point I want to make is that I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8654)|
| 2:24:27| I apologize to everybody up there on the dais.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| On behalf of no one but myself, my young friends would not support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| But, in fact, I believe that they have exceeded the bounds of reasonableness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| in the terms of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| They have, in fact, way exceeded the bounds of reasonableness in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| repeated vitriolic attacks on counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| You are not human footballs, and you should not be kicked around like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| I know that there may be people who say, well, that's a First Amendment right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| It may be a First Amendment right, but it is a wrong to be disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| Maybe it's not illegal, but it is certainly offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| And people who watch the show on the telly are saying to themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| what's going on at city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| What are these antics of these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| So I want to just say to my young friends who are not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| I'm with you on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| I respect your passion and your intelligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| but I entreat you to keep a civil tongue in your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8743)|
| 2:25:50| You people should not be abused for working as hard as you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8750)|
| 2:25:56| And that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| I want to just say namaste and salaam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| Thank you, Mr. Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| The next person signed up to speak is R. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| Mr. Marlowe, if you could approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8770)|
