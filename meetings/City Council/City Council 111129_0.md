| 0:02:35| Thank you, Father, for this opportunity to gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| I pray that we would conduct ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| in the spirit of openness and honesty and mutual respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| and, most of all, wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Let us pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=172)|
| 0:03:03| Vice Mayor Bailey. Here. Mayor Brown. Here. Councilman Dela Volpe. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here. Councilman Palmer. Here. Councilman Pavlis. Here. Councilman Roddy. Here. Councilman Thomas. Here. Councilman Woodhull. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=183)|
| 0:03:29| We do have a quorum and the Chair will entertain a motion to approve the minutes. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| A move and a properly second. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Are there any items to be withdrawn? Any items for postponement? Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=221)|
| 0:03:51| Councilman Grieve. Has anyone signed up to speak to 9G? 9G? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| The billboards. I'd like to postpone that for 12 weeks until we have an opportunity to have some additional public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=239)|
| 0:04:09| Second. Never mind. Additional input and have a possible workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=249)|
| 0:04:21| All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Councilman Palmer. And I'd like to piggyback on Councilman Grieve and Councilman Roddy's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| but I would like to encourage us to postpone this for six months instead of three and that we have a workshop on this in February or March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| And that would give us plenty of time to have the workshop, get all the stakeholders to the table and understand what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| and then be able to make some reasonable decisions. So that's a substitute motion to postpone for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| And I'll second that motion. All right. I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Well, I have no problem exactly with the motion, but if we have a workshop date that's open in the near future, i.e. next two months or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=300)|
| 0:05:09| why don't we talk about booking the workshop and close the gap a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| I mean, if we put it off for six months, that means five months from now we'll start worrying about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| and we'll have just wasted five months, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| But that's my thought that, you know, a couple of three months, if we have a workshop date available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| we can get stakeholders in here, we can get businessmen, we can get sign people, we can get neighborhood folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| we can get whatever, preservationists to tell us what's good or bad about this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| All right. Councilman Grieve, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| I did check to see whether or not we have open workshops, and we do have open availabilities both in January and February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| So the other thing is if we do it 12 weeks and we find that we don't have enough time, we can extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| Or, vice versa, if we do it six months and find out we get it done sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| But I do like Councilman Della Vopi's idea that if we actually say three months or 12 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| then we know we're working within that time frame as opposed to spreading it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Councilman Powles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Yeah, well, I would tend to, obviously, I seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| And the reason being is because, you know, this is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I just don't think that with the holidays on us and what have you, I don't think that, you know, that's just enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| I think that the six months and, again, if we got it done quicker, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| But the last thing that I want to do as a councilperson is act like we're trying to rush this thing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Because this is a huge issue to, you know, all different facets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| And we've got to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| And I'm not in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Three months, six months, you know, if it gets done, you know, eight months from now, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| But I would rather send the message out, particularly based on the phone calls that I got today from the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| that, you know, they felt like that this thing was being ramrodded through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| And, you know, that's not a good way to start a debate that's going to have the impact that this could potentially have on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| So, you know, I think if we err, we err on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And I would hope that the six months would prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Councilman De La Vova, I appreciate your thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| And I also thought that sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| My suspicion from having spoken with a number of interests in this topic is that we will have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| And we have, I'm thinking of signs 101 so that everybody is on the same level as far as their understanding of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| why we have them, the types of signs, all that kind of thing that we just kind of deal with piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| We might have two workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I'm thinking that it's very likely that we would have one workshop as an informational workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| and then we would have another workshop probably coming out of that for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| And that was why we also have new council members coming on who will have an inordinate amount of information that will be poured in quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| And I know that having been, if we all were two years ago, new to the thing, I think we need a little breathing room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| And that was why I suggested the six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| And like Councilman Pavlis, I have had some concerns that what's council trying to push through this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| And I don't like to be made to feel that way because I don't think we're pushing something through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I have no problem really with the six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| One of the reasons that I asked for the postponement is to I've gotten some calls from business folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| and the last thing I want to do is to have people think that we are pushing this through or that I personally am trying to push it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| So I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| The only condition that I would put on it is that we don't wait two or three months to have a workshop or several workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| that what we need to do is we need to go ahead and schedule in January, you know, to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| And I agree with you, Brenda, that we do need to have kind of an introduction, and then we need to have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| But I definitely want the business community, the neighborhoods, scenic Knoxville, all the stakeholders at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and to give everyone an opportunity to be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| So, you know, I guess we vote on yours and we forget about mine, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| But six months, if that's the way we want to go, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| We can vote on the substitute motion of Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| Do we need to restate that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I think we're all clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| All in favor of Councilwoman Palmer's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Well, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| I'd like to put on the consent 12E, F, G, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| And now we will vote on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| And moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Under the Mayor's report tonight, we have, I want to mention about the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| It's now open downtown at Market Square, and it's open every day, rain or shine, through January the 8th, except for Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=636)|
| 0:11:03| Mission is $10 for adults, $7 for children 12 years and younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| The Christmas parade is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| The annual WIVK Fowler's Christmas Parade will be this Friday, December the 2nd, starting at 7 p.m. on Gay Street in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=674)|
| 0:11:27| Enjoy floats, decorated vehicles, marching bands, dancers, and a special appearance by Santa Claus and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=687)|
| 0:11:37| The parade will be live on Volunteer TV Channel 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| So let's remember those activities that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| Are there any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=706)|

| 0:27:03| I was just trying to see where the access was and make sure I understand his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| His question is that would we require access all the way around the building, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| You've got enough space in the back to fight a fire, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| Well, I think in light of what the applicant has said is that to amend the motion to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| to allow one curb cut going into the piece of property, which I don't know the lot number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| of that particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Mark, do you have that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| You could just refer to it as the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Is this different than your First Amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Did you withdraw the First Amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I was saying that instead of the two, yeah, originally I said just delete the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| But you're not saying that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| What I'm saying now is, according to the applicant, one curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| What we would certainly accept is a modification of the condition so that rather than it addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| both parcels, 107KF001 and 107KF002, that it just address 107KF002, which is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| that we created the drawing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| It's the one that we asked to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| The other parcel is an entirely separate piece of property, and it didn't seem appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| to affect that piece of property when all we asked for was an adjacent piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| So procedurally, do you want to withdraw your first motion and put instead of that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| a new motion to amend that would be what he said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you, Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| We may need some assistance from Mr. Donaldson to word that amendment appropriately because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| I think the city recorder and I are having a little bit of trouble following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| But if Mr. Donaldson is willing to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| You could amend it by just saying no more than one curb cut to Sutherland Avenue will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| be permitted along parcel 107KF001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| It would be 002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Okay, 002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Well, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Now we're back to in as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| We'll entertain a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| We just need vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| So we will be back at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| 10A is an appeal by Richard Cadmus of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| four zoning variances for property located at 2201 Sutherland Avenue to permit the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| of an attached multifamily dwelling residential project in an 01 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| In conjunction, we have resolution 11M, which is a resolution approving the appeal by Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1831)|
| 0:30:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Councilman Delavaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I want to be sure I understand what we're voting on because there was an action by BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| on three or four variances related to setbacks where they approved the reduction of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| of the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I understand Mr. Cadmus is asking us to reverse that decision by approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| Is that what we're voting on, whether we reverse the BZA opinion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| A motion to approve would be to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| And the appeal is to not permit these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Do we approve the substance or just the hearing of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| What are we approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| You don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| The motion to approve is a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| The appeal is to say these variances will not be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| So that's what you would be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| It's really a reversal of BZA's action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| It's a reversal of BZA's action, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| I just want to be sure what we were voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Mayor, has anyone signed up to speak today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| I would like to hear from the person who signed up to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Mr. Cadmus has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| If you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Richard Cadmus, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| I have property adjacent to the subject property on Southern Wind Avenue, next to it and behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1926)|
| 0:32:21| I also have some handouts here that I'm not sure how to hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| What's the proper procedure for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| You can give them to Mr. Steve King beside you if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| He'll bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| There's a gentleman right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Just hand them to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| He'll bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Is this different than the stuff you sent to the city recorder's office before the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| It's only one page, and I believe it's a revision on the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1966)|
| 0:32:59| Anyway, my position is that on the application for the variances to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| on the second or third page, which is, I don't know if you have that in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| but it's on the applicant's hardship page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| He has attested that he has affirmed that the hardship described above was not created by anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=1999)|
| 0:33:28| having an ownership interest in the property since 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| But he hasn't filled in anything about the hardship above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2015)|
| 0:33:49| And according to the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Are we looking at the page that has the little headings on it in this particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| The Board of Zoning Appeals, and on the back side it says applicant's hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and there's the check boxes where it checks size and shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Is that the part you're addressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| I'm assuming the hardship would be the size would have to refer to a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| and the shape would refer to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| I'm assuming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I'm also assuming that the revision to the variances is the correct one to use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| and that means that the Board of Zoning Appeals had to find that the special conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| and circumstances did not result from the action or inaction of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| Well, this is all about the building and its placement on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| so this would kind of have to fall under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2094)|
| 0:35:05| That the granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privileges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| privilege that is denied by this code to other building structures or service systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| Well, this would just open up a whole can of worms because this would apply to virtually everything, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2121)|
| 0:35:33| And that's why I object to the Board of Zoning Appeals decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| and I'm asking to have it denied, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2140)|
| 0:35:50| Mr. Mayor, I wonder because this record is a little bit confusing when you read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| and I wouldn't mind if we heard something while this gentleman is still up there from Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| because it seems like there's two things we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| One is, should this parcel land, because of its size and shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| have different setbacks to allow them to have a multifamily structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| And then there's a second thing, and he has, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| not received permission to change it from Commercial 6 to 01 Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| under which he would be allowed to build a particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| and would be required to go for plan review before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| But I may be reading tea leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I hope that we can understand what we're supposed to be focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| The appeal was to setbacks from boundaries off of Sutherland and the sidetrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Mr. Donaldson, would you tell us how this gets approached procedurally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| in terms of how many times it comes to your organization or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| What are we doing here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| This particular agenda item is an appeal of the BZA decision to grant the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| MPC really has nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| The applicant is in the process of requesting a change of zoning on the property from C6 to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2232)|
| 0:37:23| One of the provisions of 01 is that it allows, as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| the development of a multi-dwelling structure of residences using the R2 regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2249)|
| 0:37:41| So later on in the agenda is the first reading of the request to rezone the property to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2261)|
| 0:37:49| The applicant does not want to rezone the property unless he gets these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| So he staged it so that in the event of an appeal, you would have both the appeal of the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| and the request for the zoning at the same time so you could see it as a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| And he wouldn't be obligated to a piece of property that has 01 zoning if his project doesn't fit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2287)|
| 0:38:17| But one of the concerns I'm hearing, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| is this gentleman is concerned about the size of this building or the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| and 42 units on 0.8 tenths of an acre sounds like a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| But you don't actually, if I understand it, you don't get to that question until they submit plans under an 01 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| if it's adopted, and you might say you can or can't do that or do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| They are still subject to the USUN review approval process to do a multi-dwelling structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| We have not yet received an application for that, or at least we haven't considered it on our MPC agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| So what he's asking is can he build closer to the margins of the boundaries of this property because of its size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2339)|
| 0:39:10| or shape or his desire to do something different than it would otherwise be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Well, as a supporting document to the request for the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| the applicant provided a site plan to show how the building would fit if the variances were granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| One of the criteria that the BZA has to use is that there are unique conditions to this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| that make it difficult to develop under the 01 zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and that's not a common condition throughout the zone district or throughout the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| And this is a fairly unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| It's very shallow, and I just did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| If you applied the standard setbacks to this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| you would reduce its building envelope by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| So more than half of the lot would be required yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| I mean, you'd set back yourself into the middle of the lot somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Right, and that is not a common condition with the 01 zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| Because of the big front yard setback and the large rear yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| and the corner lot condition, which requires a front yard setback on that corner side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| they essentially are locked into three front yard setbacks on the four sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| which take a big chunk of the buildable area of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Let me ask one final question so that I'm sure I know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| If we're inclined, for example, to leave the BZA decision the way it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| is there still leeway for your body or an appeal to this body to say that's too much building on a small track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| In other words, are we pre-termitting the second question, or are we just looking at the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| And we're seeing, well, you can build a little closer to the boundaries, whatever you build, if you're approved to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| That's not the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| That's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| That's your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Yeah, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| My particular issue of 11M is, will we agree with the BZA that he can build further closer to the boundaries or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2483)|
| 0:41:33| And so my question to Mr. Donaldson is, does it still leave open the question that there may be problems with allowing as much building as he wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2493)|
| 0:41:42| Mr. Kamos, he is addressing Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| But he's telling him what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Well, he's addressing Mr. Donaldson right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| So, in fact, you can sit down for a moment, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| Don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| But he's addressing Mr. Donaldson, so let Mr. Donaldson answer his question, if you don't mind, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| In the event that the variances hold up, they would become the new minimum yard requirements for any multi-dwelling structure that is built on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2525)|
| 0:42:18| It still would have to pass muster with all of the other requirements of the R2 zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| and any conditions that the planning commission may want to apply to such an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2544)|
| 0:42:33| And any decision of the MPC on a use on review is appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2553)|
| 0:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I'm sorry, Mr. Kamos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I was trying to make sure that you're telling us about the part that's in front of us right now as opposed to a second piece of this pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| And I think I got it straight, so I'll hear whatever you had to say beyond that if you have something further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Before he comes, let me hear from Attorney Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Charles Swanson needs to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I keep interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| But, again, there's a procedural matter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I do not have an opinion as to whether or not you should grant or deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| And I'm not going to give you any advice on whether or not you should grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| What I do want to give you advice about is the standard you use in making the decision with regard to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| or not you grant or deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| The standard that was provided to you by the appellant here, frankly, when I got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| and I looked at it and I didn't recognize it and I tried to figure out what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| and, fortunately, the law director is here and was able to recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| This is from the Building Board of Adjustment and Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| That doesn't apply to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| These aren't the rules that apply to you in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| The rules that apply to you in this matter are the rules that are in Article 7 of your zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| And let me just read for you, very briefly, the standards that you are to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| in determining whether or not you approve the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| or whether you grant the appeal, which would, in effect, deny the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Those standards are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| In granting a variance, the board shall ascertain that the following criteria are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| Variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or siting, that's S-I-T-I-N-G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| fully described in the findings of the board, do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| Number two, variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| from the particular district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Number three, for reasons set forth, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| Number four, any variance granted under the provisions of this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| And number five, the granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| There is room for debate for you with regard to those standards on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| but those are the standards that you use with regard to this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| and not this set of standards from the Building Board of Adjustment and Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| which were passed out by the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| I think it would probably be appropriate, after all this discussion, to once again clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Well, I mean, just before we actually take the vote, just for clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| to make sure where we're going, a yea vote and a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| What they mean, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| I was going to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| I'm going to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| Meaning there's no motion pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Mayor, is Mr. Cadmus the only one who's here to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| He is the only one signed up for that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| And I would like to ask Mr. Cadmus one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Other than your dispute with the code that you gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| do you have an issue as to how these variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| and the subsequent rezoning will personally affect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| I understand you own adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Do you have a concern about a lack of use or lack of value with your adjacent property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Can you explain that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| Well, this is going to bring the setback right up to Southerland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| The building right up to Southerland, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| In an area where my property is required to be set back, I believe, 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| My building is required to be set back 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| That's not good for frontage foot for a commercial building to be shoved back in a hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| especially at a bottleneck in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| It's just not going to improve the area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2866)|
| 0:47:55| And if this was a good idea, if this was perfectly permissible and everybody did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| then why even have a code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| Why even, you know, this is just throwing everything out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| And also I'd like to say the thing I passed out was a revision on the gentleman at the corner of the desk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2891)|
| 0:48:24| stopped at number five, but number D says requirements for granting of a variance before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2904)|
| 0:48:32| shall have the authority to grant the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| The person claiming the variance has the burden of showing basically a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| I'm paraphrasing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| There was no hardship shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| The Board of Zoning Appeals had nothing to base their opinion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Because Mr. Hill attested that wherever it is, it appears that Mr. Hill attested to the legal hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2929)|
| 0:49:09| He affirmed the hardship described above was not created by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| Well, he didn't describe the hardship above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| The whole process was skewed by the fact that that line wasn't filled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| because the Board of Zoning Appeals has to consider the hardship, and they had no hardship to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you, Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I also have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Mr. Donaldson, is there as this, I think, at 40,000 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| is revitalization of an area that has seen some blight and some disinvestment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| While the southwest corner of this intersection has seen some redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| other areas of this intersection have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| If we're looking at trying to incentivize investment and redevelopment in the city at this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| is there any reason why adjacent property owners or other property owners in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Mr. Cadmus or the owner of the Critter Barn and others, could not also apply for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| if they would make their property more easily developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| I'm sorry, I asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| It's a very complicated question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Is there any reason why other property owners could not also apply for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Is there anything prohibiting them from doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Everyone has the right to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| but you do have to present a case arguing that your property is unique from all of the others in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| and would suffer a hardship if you applied the general requirements of the zone district to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| And were you at the, you were not at the BZA meeting when this hardship was thus described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| I caught the tail end of this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| And as I recall, there was some discussion about the relative lack of depth to this particular lot as a unique condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3058)|
| 0:51:11| Mayor, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| My name is Tim Hill, and I think I've made a procedural misstep here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| I was unaware that the applicant had to sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| I would request that I would have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| If someone wants to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| I'll recognize him, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| My name is Tim Hill, 6807 Sherwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| We are proposing what we think is a very complimentary and maybe even pioneering project for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3096)|
| 0:51:46| We consider this to soon be the gateway to many students and faculty and others as they'll enjoy the new intramural project on the western section of Sutherland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3106)|
| 0:52:03| Quite frankly, shocked that we had any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| This is, I think, would be a dramatic improvement to the area where no one has been investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| It looks as either it was zoning gone wild or zoning gone absent over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| I'm not sure which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| But we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| The hardship is the topography and the unique lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| It's very narrow, and that's our hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Well, if there's no motion, then that item would not hear the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3158)|
| 0:52:50| We'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Vick's Package Store, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission for a license to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| And moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to G.E. King and Kim King Morton for one parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| located at 1208 Beaumont Avenue within the limits of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| pursuant to the Homemakers Program for a contract sales price of $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Councilman Delavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Could I ask Ms. Wade a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Becky, do I understand that this is sort of documentation that's set aside, put in escrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| and if the couple does not develop and put the home back in use under the Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| that it comes back to the city so that you can try again to get someone to develop it and put it back into residential use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| They have 180 days to complete the rehabilitation of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| So no one is technically, what, permanently transferring the property tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| but you're setting it up so that they have a chance to develop it, and if they don't, it comes back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| No, they are being sold the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| However, there is a clawback provision that if they fail to meet the agreements of the Homemakers Agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| then we can take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| That's what you said, they have 180 days to get it under way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Are you finished, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| We have a motion, been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| On the previous item, I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson if he would give a clarification to Mr. Hill and Mr. Cadmus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3285)|
| 0:54:55| in case they may be unclear or anyone in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Certainly, the matter that was before Council was a matter to grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| and the resolution was a resolution granting the appeal, or the ordinance was granting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| Absent a motion, it would die for lack of a motion, and if it dies for lack of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| the practical effect of that is upholding the previous action of the Board of Zoning Appeals in granting the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| So that's the ultimate outcome of what happened in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| There was no motion made, so the variances that were granted at the Board of Zoning Appeals have been upheld by the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3326)|
| 0:55:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| for the Washington Pike Roadway Improvement Project for an amount not to exceed $1,255,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Mr. Councilman De La Volta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| If I could, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to ask Mr. King a question if he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| I see him sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Is this the one that we acted on earlier that has both Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| and the connector from Millertown that will improve that stretch from basically the interstate over towards Murphy Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Is that the section we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| No, that section you're referring to is not in the corporate limits of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| That's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| The section of Washington Pike that we're referring to with this project starts at Greenway Drive in front of Target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| and proceeds to Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| And it does not incorporate the Millertown Pike section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with K&F Construction Services, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3404)|

| 0:57:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| This project goes back quite a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| And I know it was something that former Vice Mayor Becker and Councilman Woodhull were working on together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| And I wondered if Councilman Woodhull could give us a report as to the outcome of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| At the time, there was some concern about the city's plans meeting the neighborhood's needs and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3442)|
| 0:57:32| I actually don't have any kind of update as it's current, at least since Councilman Becker's been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| But I do know that there have been some meetings and that the community, well, Councilman Thomas, you've got something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| But my understanding is that Becker and I went through this long process of visioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| and talking to the community about what they felt like they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| But where we landed when we concluded our round was that the community was willing to get more practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| and build off of what they already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| And that they were OK with that as a beginning point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Pretty much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| I got engaged, of course, after Mr. Becker left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| And at that point, there were several more meetings that involved Joe Walsh with Parks and Recs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| David Massey was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| We had multiple meetings with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| They had a couple of different questions and some possible options that they wanted to run by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| But in the end, the decision was made to go forward with this plan after it was adjusted a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| And the neighborhood representatives felt like as far as the amount of money that was budgeted, that this was a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3525)|
| 0:58:54| I do think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| And I'm actually glad that Councilman Roddy brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| I do think it's fair and legitimate to say that the community still is under a lot of distress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| and does not have the adequate tools to work with their young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| But this is an important step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And I'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Naturally, the community wanted something larger and maybe could accommodate some more activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| But just at that point, with the amount of money that was budgeted and the timeline that that money would be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| the decision was made and it was accepted by the community that this was the best we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| And it's definitely a vast improvement of what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| I wanted to call on Mr. Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Do you have anything that you'd like to add in terms of the timeline with the development of this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| David Massey, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| And I would just concur with Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Basically, really what the community wanted was a full-size, regulation-size gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3595)|
| 1:00:05| And that wasn't in the cards, not only for budget reasons, but also because of site restrictions at that particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| Also, I know that if Joe Walsh was here, he would say that this is a template for some other improvements to other recreation centers of the same size and vintage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3612)|
| 1:00:23| And so we worked with the neighborhood over a number of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| They tossed out a number of things that we worked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| And in the end, I think they're not satisfied that we can't build a bigger building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| but they're satisfied that we're doing what we can within the budgetary and site constraints that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| And, Mr. Massey, KCDC's participation in this goes back to the renovation that KCDC did in Lonsdale Homes and the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3645)|
| 1:00:54| They were kind of duplicate services, very close to one another, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| There was a city-owned rec center and then a KCDC rec center within the Lonsdale Homes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Right, just three or four blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| to get out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| I mean, they're a housing agency, and they decided to get out of providing recreation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| And so the $150,000 from KCDC was in recognition of that withdrawal and support for the city to expand our center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3676)|
| 1:01:25| And the city will continue to provide staffed services at this recreation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| It's not just a blank space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| I mean, it's also programmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Yeah, there are two staff members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| I believe they're full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I don't know about staffing up beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| There's somebody else that wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Oh, Kristen's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Kristen Manuel, 117 Country Walk Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| We do have two full-time staff members that are there at the Lonsdale Rec Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| and they will be running the rec center during all the hours that we do all of our other rec centers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| So after-school needs for the children are addressed and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| That center is traditionally open 11 in the morning until 7 at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| so it does some programming for seniors, mothers, and things before after-school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| Then the bulk of it is the after-school program, 245 to approximately 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| And then from 530 on to 7, we offer more programming for parents, families, teens, middle school, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| I'm in support of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| I know a lot of work has gone into getting, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| this goes back many years, so I'm glad we're finally at a point of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3756)|

| 1:05:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| It's ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| 11J is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to request the public building authority of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, to perform project management services for construction of a replacement roofing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| at the Adaptive Center in an amount not to exceed $155,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Could Mr. King just maybe just very briefly explain to us how are we paying the PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| What is their fee on these particular projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| I think that's rolled into a larger contract that Mr. York may have more information on than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| This is what's already included in the contract that we have with them for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| It's not additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Is that right, Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| That would be correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Mr. King, let me ask you, I asked you earlier, but on these roofing projects, do we use the same contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| or different contractors on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| The PBA will use one of their term contractors that they have already gone through a selection process for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| But it would not necessarily be the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| As have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| 11K is a resolution initiating a hillside and ridgetop protection plan as an amendment to the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4003)|

| 1:06:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| We have three people who have signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| The first person is Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| If you could come down and give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| I've already given your name, but you can give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| I'm president of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County, a nonpartisan organization with 160 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| the majority of whom are city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| The League aims to encourage the best local government possible and the full participation of citizens in their democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4057)|
| 1:07:46| We would like to thank you for undertaking an issue so important to our future prosperity and our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| This hillside and ridgetop protection plan is a great illustration of the potential of good government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| a government that works, that looks after the interests of the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| You created an excellent participatory process that asked citizens to help plan for our future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| We cannot let you forget that the citizens did give three years of effort to participate in drafting this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| and next you hired a facilitator that incorporated ideas from groups that claimed to be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| And this required even more time and effort from dozens of people, including us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4104)|
| 1:08:32| All viewpoints have been taken into account, and the plan was duly modified in your joint process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| The League believes that what happens tonight demonstrates your respect for citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| citizen involvement in government, and for the facilitated process that you created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| The trust of citizens is at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| The League has been involved all the way through this long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| and we watched in disbelief last week as special interests pushed through amendments at the last minute in commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| overturning the rational, open process that you and your colleagues created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| It's time to say no to the chaotic distractions of special interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| and say yes to maintaining the trust of your ordinary citizens and homeowners who live upstream and downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| those who expect their government representatives to function with integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| and make decisions in the long-term best interest of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Vote yes to approve this plan without any further changes or amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| We actually have more than three people signed up for that, so I guess we have five people signed to speak to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4184)|
| 1:09:54| So if council is all right with allowing all five to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| Five minutes each is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| I don't think we have to have a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| The next person is Margot Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4208)|
| 1:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I'm Margot Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I live at 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, and I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| I'm here because I would like to focus on the private property rights of people who live here in Knoxville and in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4227)|
| 1:10:38| and especially the immediate impact on Knoxvillians who live adjacent to slopes and ridges that are under development now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4238)|
| 1:10:47| or that will be in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And specifically, I'd like to offer the example of Cheryl Hill and North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| which are being developed on steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Nobody is saying that these should not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| In fact, we encourage those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| We're happy that those areas are being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| But we want best practices followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| I just saw in the paper today that a large assisted living complex is going to go in at Cheryl Hill, and that's been long awaited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4273)|
| 1:11:24| Neighbors next door do hope that there won't be any further clear-cutting that goes along with that particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4284)|
| 1:11:34| Residents in Lake Ridge, North Shore Landing, Statesview, and Seven Oaks have been affected by clear-cutting at North Shore Town Center and Cheryl Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4294)|
| 1:11:47| And they have lived for years with runoff, lack of privacy, light and noise pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| and in a few cases even real property loss due to erosion and runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| The four neighborhoods that I just listed are active voting members of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| and I'm the president of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| There are 734 households in those four neighborhoods I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| Those neighborhoods contain a minimum of $180 million worth of real estate that currently contributes to the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4339)|
| 1:12:30| I'm basing that figure on a median home value that is actually lower than what is reported in the most recent census figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4350)|
| 1:12:43| Not for Knox County, but for those specific census tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| The Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan, as written without any last-minute amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| provides guidelines, not mandates, for successful and responsible development on slopes and ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| The Council of West Knox County Homeowners strongly believes that property rights must be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| the property rights of existing homeowners, not just land speculators, realtors, and other special interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4388)|
| 1:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| We also have Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| If you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4403)|
| 1:13:44| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| I'm Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I'm the group chair for the Sierra Club Harvey Broome Group in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| We cover 19 counties in this immediate area and have about, in the city, we have about 450 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4434)|
| 1:14:05| We are a grassroots environmental organization, and this kind of issue is exactly what we work on nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4445)|
| 1:14:16| I've been privileged to be in the meetings and watch you all deliberate in the facilitated sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| I felt, personally felt, and I think the group feels that we came out of that session with a stronger plan than we went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4464)|
| 1:14:36| We discussed, you all in the county commission, discussed the issues that concerned you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| We arrived at a decision on those issues and a consensus and put it in the plan, and that plan is what's before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4482)|
| 1:14:51| We noticed with some dismay the motion introduced by Commissioner Briggs in the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4491)|
| 1:15:02| which essentially negates the effect of the plan altogether by its wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| It's very difficult to understand what it actually means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| We oppose that effort, and we favor adoption of the plan as it was finally consented to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4511)|
| 1:15:21| and issued to you after the last facilitated session with Dr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| So with that, you folks have the opportunity to make a, I say, a monumental and historic decision for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4528)|
| 1:15:40| in terms of land use and environmental protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| I don't believe in 35 years that I've followed the workings of county government and the city council to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| I'm a part of that time as a member of the county commission that I've ever seen an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| that it was more important than this one for the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| When you vote on this issue, you're not voting for what's going to happen tomorrow or next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| but you're voting on the long-range development of the city of Knoxville and its area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| And I think 10 years or 15 years from now, you'll look back on this and say that was a very good vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4578)|
| 1:16:27| It's a plan that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| It's led to a protection of our city, and as one prior speaker pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| about the kind of view we have of our city in terms of hills and ridges and tree growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4595)|
| 1:16:44| and just its general appearance, it needs to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| And this issue, this plan will do that as well as solve, we hope, with proper administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| and control some of the drainage problems that we've experienced in the last 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| and are still experiencing them with every new development and with the work or the rain that occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| where the contracts have been let to clear ground without adequate protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4636)|
| 1:17:27| Trees and grass keep the water from running off and keep the mud from running off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| And this plan is a plan that promotes the use of protective features to protect our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| protect the beauty of the city, and make it more livable than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| and thank you for your effort in developing this plan to its current point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| The next person we have is Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| If you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| And I failed to say, but most of you already know, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| I'm Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| I'm here tonight on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| The Chamber, like these other organizations who have been represented here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| is just another organization in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| It's not a special interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| It's made up of people who are also members of these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| It's the people who live down the street from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It's made up of 2,100 local businesses who choose to go together to support interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| matters of interest to the businesses in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| They support many other things, including many worthwhile organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| And that's what the Chamber is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| It's not some special interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| They're also in favor of good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| They're in favor of protecting the hillsides and the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| And they're not opposed to the adoption of the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| They feel the plan could have been better, could include provisions that would make it stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| But I'm not here tonight on their behalf to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| What I would urge you to do, though, is to be sure that you understand the legal impact of what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| to be sure that the plan says what you think it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| and to be sure that the people of Knoxville and all these property owners that everyone wants to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| can pick up the plan and understand what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| County Commission took a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| And after thoroughly discussing the issue and talking to many constituents about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| came to the conclusion that the plan would be improved by the assertion of a short provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| three sentences, that made it clear what the legal effect of the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| This was not new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| This was language that was sent to all of you on November the 9th before the last facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| It was sent to the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| The Chamber at that time urged that this language be included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| It was included in the black line of the plan that the Chamber prepared and sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| The facilitator chose not to present it at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| and the public did not have an opportunity to speak when the facilitator was calling on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| So it wasn't discussed, but it was presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| And subsequently it was presented to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| and they modified the language and approved it as an amendment to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| The next day, as soon as it was done, the Chamber wanted you to know that that had happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and sent you a copy of that amendment the day after it was approved by County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| And what that amendment says is what has been said all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| You've heard at every meeting that this document is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| It's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| It's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| It's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| This document never says it's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| There is nothing in this document that tells anyone what its legal effect is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| To know that, you almost have to be a lawyer because it says it's an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| Well, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| And the answer is, I would urge you to ask your lawyer and have him confirm exactly what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| But it means that it becomes an enforceable part of the general plan that must be followed in future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4885)|
| 1:21:33| It's binding on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| It's binding on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| It's binding on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| That's what the Tennessee Code says about general plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| You're asked to approve this as a general plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| That makes it binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| That makes it the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| The reason they say it's not binding is that it says should in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| And there are places where it uses the word guidelines and places where it uses the word recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| But they tell you it's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| If that's the case, we would urge you to make that clear and include the same amendment the county commission adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| which doesn't change the substance of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| It doesn't address any of the slope percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| It doesn't do anything to densities, to clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| All it says is it explains the legal effect of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| And it says that this is intended to be an advisory plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| And it is not intended to form a legal portion of the general plan that would be enforceable on you and binding on future decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4948)|
| 1:22:38| And the third sentence says, and the provisions of the sector plans that deal with these same issues are also advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| so that every sector of the city and every sector of the county would be subject to the same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| And you wouldn't have someone who happened to have a sector or plan approved last month subject to one set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| and someone subject to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| So that's all that this amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| We would urge you to be consistent with what county commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| County commission didn't try to spring this on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| The language was before you and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| You just may not have known it at the time because the facilitator didn't present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| But we would urge you to amend the plan to adopt the same language the county commission adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| And with that, make it clear to anyone who picks up the plan what the legal effect of the plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| and how it affects their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| I don't understand what the opposition is to making it clear what the plan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| We urge you to adopt that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| And with that amendment, the chamber does not oppose adoption of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| We'd be happy to answer any questions any of you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| The next person we have is Steve Seifried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5030)|
| 1:24:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| I'm Steve Seifried, 1125 Snowden Drive in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| I would agree with all the comments made in favor of approving this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| And I come tonight just to say I've been part of one planning session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| and then watched this issue debated from afar as many, many people in Knoxville have for over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| And I encourage you to adopt this plan as it is being proposed to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| I also ask you to do this as a citizen of North Knoxville, but also on behalf of my two sons, both 8 and 11 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5077)|
| 1:24:48| This place here in Knoxville, we moved here eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| It's a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| It makes great sense for people for this, for our hilltops and slopes to be preserved and protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5094)|
| 1:25:04| And I feel very strongly just for our future and our kids, my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| and many families who really haven't stepped up and said anything about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| please just go ahead and approve this and let's move along and make this positive decision for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I believe that's the last speaker on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| And we have a motion that has been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| I didn't see your light, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| And also we have a light over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| I just wanted to address a few issues here, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| Mr. Donaldson, if I could ask you, you know, the issue of, in your opinion, is this advisory, suggestive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5150)|
| 1:25:59| Is it binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Is it legally binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Is it non-binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| And let me ask you also, well, go ahead and answer that if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| Plans are advisory, but land use decisions must be consistent with those plans according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| State law itself is a bit contradictory in that it very clearly says that the purpose of a regional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| is to convey the recommendations of the planning commission to the legislative bodies for the development of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5190)|
| 1:26:39| And then later on in the same part of the code it says that land use decisions must be consistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5199)|
| 1:26:49| So, yes, it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| Is it legally binding or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Is it regulatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| It's definitely not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| But land use decisions that come before you should be viewed with respect to the plans that have been adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| and, according to state law, must be consistent with those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| Okay, so this plan clearly spells out what the MPC would recommend, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| Yes, we believe it clearly does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| and we believe the language clearly demonstrates that these are recommendations and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5245)|
| 1:27:37| I think that the process that city council and county commission went through with the facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| to reach the version that you've got in front of you did a lot to address those concerns about the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| that might be levied to the legislative bodies on individual site-specific cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| and the language was modified to reflect that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| If a property owner or developer wanted to appeal the MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| with the current plan that we're looking at now, who would they appeal it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| In the case of an amendment to the general plan or the sector plan, MPC adopts or can adopt an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5300)|
| 1:28:32| but it's not operative until the legislative body has approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| So you, as city council, are the ultimate authority on plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| On zoning cases, the MPC merely makes a recommendation to the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| so city council is the ultimate authority on zoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| The zoning ordinance creates a couple of provisions that give authority to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| for what we call uses on review and the approval of development plans in planned zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| but those decisions made by the planning commission are appealable to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| so ultimately city council is the authority on those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| So any MPC or BZA decisions would still be appealed to the city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| Mr. Swanson, I've talked to you quite a bit about this over the period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| In your opinion, if the plan is passed as it's currently presented, is it legally binding or non-binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| Well, so far, I think I agree with all the legal opinions expressed here tonight thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5384)|
| 1:29:54| And the Tennessee Code says that there is a regional plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| and the folks who have said that the regional plan, if it is a part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| there may be no development that is inconsistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| You may not approve development that is inconsistent with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| So the plan has that impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| It says that there is a regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Also, there are accompanying maps, plats, charts, and descriptive matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| So in my view, as I look at this thing, as I look at the plan that's presented to you in this booklet, which is attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5428)|
| 1:30:39| you see section one is background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| You see section two is plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| You see section three is implementation and action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| And then you have appendices A through I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| And then you have maps and tables and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| In my view, with what is before you now, without the Briggs Amendment, you would amend the plan with regard to section two, the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5459)|
| 1:31:12| The rest of it would fit in that category of accompanying maps, plats, charts, and descriptive matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| That would not become necessarily a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| But that part that's identified as section two of the plan, in my view, becomes part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| And thus could not be would have a legal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Now, if you're asking me whether that is different, if you add the Briggs Amendment to it, my answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| Because as I view it, in reading the Briggs Amendment, essentially the impact that that has is it takes section two, the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| even though it says it's the plan, I think it takes it out of being the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| and it makes it part of the accompanying maps, plats, charts, and descriptive matter of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| And it very specifically says it doesn't become a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| It's just advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| So if it's just advisory and doesn't become part of the plan, then it's got to be an accompanying map, plats, charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| or descriptive matter, I guess mostly descriptive matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| So did that tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| You know, in the last joint meeting we had, I chaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| And I listened and it went back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| And the thing that became clear to me is that it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| And that as lawmakers, the one thing that we ought to be doing is we ought to present something to the public that's precise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5553)|
| 1:32:42| and clear and that's easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| And it shouldn't have to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| And that's what happens every time we get to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| And that's been the big elephant in the room all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| And it wasn't until the county commission left and brought it to a vote that that issue was clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| And so I think as a body, one thing I want to say, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| is that this effort over the last three years has brought these issues to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| And so we've come a long, long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| And no matter what happens, I think this is a great step in a number of steps that we've taken recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| in terms of our natural assets and scenery and beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| and some of the environmental issues that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| But I think we have a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| This is a 78-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| And I think we have a responsibility to make it definite and clear to anyone that would want to pursue a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5618)|
| 1:33:47| attempt to develop it, because no one is going to take a piece of property unless they know exactly what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5627)|
| 1:33:56| And then, again, you have property owners who have held on to a lot of this property for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5636)|
| 1:34:03| And there's property rights involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| So I think that the prudent thing for us to do is to move this along in the direction that it was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5646)|
| 1:34:16| that would clearly allow anyone that wanted to develop property to know what's going to be recommended by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5656)|
| 1:34:28| And then, again, I ask the questions of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| I'm not so clear that in the way it's set forth here, if someone didn't like the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| that they have the right to appeal to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| I've heard other legal advice opposite of that, contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| So I guess my point is, and I don't want to talk about the Briggs Amendment necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| but I think we owe it to the public to add a couple of sentences that makes it clear whether this is binding or non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5691)|
| 1:35:01| And my intent is, at some point, to make some sort of suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| and some sort of a substitute motion to add a sentence or two that would be acceptable to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5706)|
| 1:35:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| Councilman Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| Well, before I heard what our council stated, I was, and I still think that the intent of the amendment is honorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5722)|
| 1:35:34| because it's attempting to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| However, I think that it inadvertently creates less clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5737)|
| 1:35:47| I think that there is advisory language throughout this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| And I'm afraid that the addition of this amendment inadvertently marginalizes the work of the people themselves in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5753)|
| 1:36:03| Mark, do you think my opinion is off base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| Or let me ask you this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| Does this amendment help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5770)|
| 1:36:20| Does it help you to see more clearly through the lens of this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| I believe there are phrases within the Briggs amendment that are kind of self-contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5785)|
| 1:36:34| And when viewed by a reader, would certainly advertise the fact that these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5794)|
| 1:36:45| which we would all like to follow, are non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| And I think through that injects uncertainty into the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| Because the reader could then feel that there is a chance to develop his property not following these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5815)|
| 1:37:06| And not only a chance, a good chance, if he simply holds up that paragraph and says this is a non-binding plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| So you're saying that the paragraph is not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I believe it injects uncertainty into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| And the preface to Dr. Briggs' amendment was to try to create clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| And I think it works just the opposite, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Do you think if someone were sitting in your seat in your role with MPC and had not been privy to the whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5850)|
| 1:37:38| and all they had was this plan, would they also have your point of view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| It certainly is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| We work in this kind of an environment every day where statutes appear to be contradictory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| and plans seem to contradict one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| And we do the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Do you think that this amendment marginalizes the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| In other words, seems to kind of overstate a point that's already embedded in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| to the point where it almost is like a warning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I think by creating a paragraph such as this and injecting it on the front end of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| with terms like non-binding and not intended to form an official part of the plan at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| that it says it shall make all of the other plans advisory, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5915)|
| 1:38:44| Even without this amendment, we can celebrate a huge success in terms of the two bodies coming to an agreement over this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| So that's why I'm not in favor of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| So just for clarity, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| You can't have clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Of which amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| There isn't one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| So let me ask this, just a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| If there is language inserted after, if we were to vote this up, it goes to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| and then it would be back to us on the 13th, the final meeting for the sitting council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| Then if new language was injected, then it would have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| Would that be right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| It depends on where you inject the new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| But when it comes back from MPC, you're free to make changes to it if you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| It's going to come back to you with a recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| But because you initiated this one as opposed to MPC, you can make changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| Now, you couldn't make a substantive change to it that wasn't within the consideration of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| I mean, you couldn't just go completely out of bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| and put something in there that MPC had never even considered the topic before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| But if you just make wording changes to what comes back to you from MPC that are not so completely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| than what has been considered before, in my view, I don't think it has to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| You know, I've sat through more meetings than I care to think about on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| It's surprising to me that Dr. Briggs did not bring this up at our last joint meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| where we were trying to hammer out the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| And, frankly, my opinion is that he's a better doctor than he is a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| because what he's proposing here is essentially to say this thing that looks and feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| and smells like a plan is not a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| It's just a report that you look at for guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| And that's okay if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| But it seems to me that the honest and straightforward approach is to say either we think this is a good plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| and we adopt it or we vote against it and we vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| But to say that it's kind of a plan but it isn't a plan and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| it kind of waffles back and forth and it sounds good, it seems to me it just dodges the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| I will submit that the language that we put in the preface in that last meeting addressed the core issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| that we're all concerned about is, and that is, do we have flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| And it did two things, I think, if you turn to the preface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| You'll see the first thing it did is it talked about this plan sets forth kind of an overall vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| of what we're looking at trying to do to have both development but protection of our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| but also recognize that we were going to have a legislative body that would have to put in implementing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| And the last sentence tried to buy what I think we're all aching for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| and that is we can't make a general rule and it fits every single situation exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| It's just not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| It's possible not to do that in such a broad-brush approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| It says the plan likewise recognizes that flexibility will be needed in applying these general goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| and principles to specific proposals and site conditions on unique parcels of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| and leaves room for approval of sound engineering and creative solutions to meet these objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| Between that kind of overarching view that the plan intends internally to have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6162)|
| 1:42:50| and the notion that, in the worst case, we are the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| If this plan gives us problems downstream, we're the ones that can initiate an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| But I think the honest thing on the table now should be after hammering at this thing for more than we all want to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| we either approve it or vote it down instead of saying it ain't what it really looks like, it's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| It's kind of half fish and half fowl and half something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| That's kind of an illusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| And I think we ought to be straightforward and either vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| First, I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| Do you agree with Mr. Donaldson's opinion that everything contained herein at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| lacking the supporting enforceable ordinances that we've talked about that might ultimately need to be passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| that lacking that, everything contained herein that would amend the general plan is appealable ultimately to city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| I think everything that you could do with that plan ultimately is appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Now, as city council, if you're sitting in your quasi-judicial authority, you are confined by what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6237)|
| 1:44:08| And a general plan is part of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| And so if you approve something, if it gets appealed to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| and city council then approves something that's totally outside of the plan, that's inconsistent with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| then somebody could file a writ of certiorari in the chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| And I think the chancery court would review that and say, the state law says you're bound not to develop property in a way that's inconsistent with your general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6270)|
| 1:44:41| You just did that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| Therefore, that's not a valid thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| And so you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| I don't think if you're working within the framework of a general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| I don't think you have complete and total autonomy to do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| But it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| This document can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| I mean, I think this whole thing is about as clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| And, you know, what this council has struggled with, I think, over and over again, at its core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| someone said the elephant in the room, is that we don't have the enforceable ordinances developed yet to execute this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| And so the question is, you know, as Councilman Della Volpe said, is it fish or fowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| Is it something that's enforceable or non-enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I guess because we have heard from two respected sources here tonight that ultimately everything that's contained herein can be appealed to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6332)|
| 1:45:44| understanding the restrictions that Mr. Swanson just set out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| I do agree with Mr. Della Volpe that the preface at the beginning of this plan is very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| that implementation of these objectives depends on future adoption of ordinances and regulations by the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| That's where the rubber's going to meet the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| You know, I'm loathe to adopt something that is not consistent with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| That was my resistance to approving this many long months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| And we never considered this plan for a vote because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| because I don't want to see development in the city become less attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| I don't want to see disinvestment in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| And I don't want to see us out of sync with the county on something that's this important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| But I truly believe that going forward, the implementation of this plan is going to be carried out by the development of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| And I think when we get into those specific rubber meets the road kinds of ordinances and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| that's where it's going to be critical that we hold hands with the county and that it's similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| At this juncture, at 40,000 feet, I feel comfortable that the preface is clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| that there is more work to be done, that new requests and plans need to be executed to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6420)|
| 1:47:10| And that what this plan would do if adopted to amend the general plan is appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6430)|
| 1:47:19| So at this juncture, I support the plan where it is without an amendment that might further perhaps muddy the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6439)|
| 1:47:29| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| I agree with Councilman Roddy and Councilman Delavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| We spent a long time talking about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| We had a facilitator who met with individual groups, individuals who had ample opportunity for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| We had some public input at our hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| So I really left the joint meeting with Commission feeling that we had a document that both bodies were comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6473)|
| 1:48:05| When that change occurred at the Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| I was incredibly disappointed that we had invested ourselves into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| and it seemed to be going in a direction that I don't think we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| To me, it was a breach of trust, and I just had a really difficult time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| I will be supporting the plan tonight without an amendment because I think that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| As my colleagues have pointed out, we will have ample opportunities to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| or deal with anything that needs to be addressed or dealt with that may not have been within our scope of vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6520)|
| 1:48:48| as we move through this for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| I appreciate those comments, and this thing began as a statement of shared vision, principle, and policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6536)|
| 1:49:05| And, you know, Councilman Delavaux, you talk about it being a vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| and that not every situation, not one size doesn't fit all, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| And I think just the vagueness in going back through these six meetings we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| the shoulds and all this sort of stuff, it's just so very vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| and just the opposite of what we ought to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| And while I don't think that necessarily the Commissioner Briggs amendment is exactly what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6570)|
| 1:49:36| I think there ought to be a sentence or two in there that reconfirms that this is what it was intended to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6576)|
| 1:49:45| and what it was set out to be all along as guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| And I don't think it's that difficult to get there, to have a sentence or two in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| which takes us back to what's been consistent all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| And for those people who I know Commissioner Norman's here, I know some of these meetings that I don't even want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6599)|
| 1:50:09| and name some of the names and situations, but it was a pretty bad set of circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| and a terrible atmosphere to try to do something very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| And I applaud you for all that you did and that you've gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| And, you know, you deserve a lot of applause for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| You know, I just feel like I owe it to those folks, those property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| and people that have hung in there for a long, long time for me to make a substitute motion to approve the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6636)|
| 1:50:46| with some sort of acceptable language, albeit a sentence or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| And what I'd like to do is go ahead and make a substitute motion to approve the plan with the county commissioner's amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6651)|
| 1:51:00| which I have here as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| What I'd like to do with council, if anybody cares to second that, is to pick the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| to delete the language out of there, which I think is unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| So I'll start with making the county commission's alternate 11K as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6677)|
| 1:51:27| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I know we don't have a second to get on the table yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| and one of the reasons why I'm not doing that is I neglected to ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| So I think procedurally we're still on the discussion of the plan rather than this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| And I apologize, but one hesitancy that I do have is a discussion that I've had with Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6702)|
| 1:51:50| And in the plan, if you will indulge me and look at page 48, it talks about staff review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| And, you know, again, what we have struggled with is the enforceability of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| and what are the unintended consequences that it might create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| And we are all very aware that we are in tight budget times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| and I would be very reluctant to pass a sweeping initiative like this that creates the need for a number of new staff positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6731)|
| 1:52:21| that it would be difficult for the city to afford to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| Mr. King, on page 48 there are some recommendations there at the bottom regarding staff review and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6745)|
| 1:52:34| regarding a heightened level of review and inspections under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| What are your thoughts about the liability that this might create for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| in terms of the additional staffing necessary to carry this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Well, as you know, Ms. Roddy, typically staff has little input on issues like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6768)|
| 1:52:57| but we have had some internal discussions about what level of review would be required on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6777)|
| 1:53:06| particularly from the engineering side of my responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| And I think there would be some additional review that we would have to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| as we go forth if this is adopted into future budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| So what I hear you saying is this would require additional staff time and perhaps additional personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Potentially support, which, again, I think brings us back to the enforceability of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| You know, are we passing something that then engineering is directed to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| and to execute immediately next year, or is it simply a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| and engineering would not be required to execute that level of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| until the supplemental ordinances are passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| Mr. Swanson, you've given us an opinion about how this falls within the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| In terms of page 48 and 49 and the review level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| do you feel like this is a directive to city government to begin to execute the kind of inspections that are called for here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| I don't think a general plan can require staff changes within a municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| I think that's beyond the purview of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Now, this makes recommendations for additional review and staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| but I don't think through a plan you can compel a municipality to add additional staffing for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6868)|
| 1:54:41| And, you know, it clearly says it recommends greater level of review and inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| but that word recommends, I think, is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| I think a court reviewing that particular sentence, and I'm just sort of narrowing down to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| but I think a court looking at that sentence is not going to say general plan requires more staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| and you don't have any more staff than you had when we started, therefore you violated your general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| I don't think that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Well, but could a court say that the plan requires more inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| and you didn't carry it out because you didn't have adequate staff to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| Could a court say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| That's a loaded question, because a court could say virtually anything, and some of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6917)|
| 1:55:24| But I don't view that as something that a court of appeals is likely to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| So your sense is that, again, carrying out the inspections that might be required to execute some of this is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6930)|
| 1:55:39| dependent on those next steps that are laid out in one of the appendices regarding the adoption of future ordinances and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6939)|
| 1:55:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| To that extent, that would be accompanying descriptive matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| Well, I want to be very clear, because page 48 is in the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| In the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| Reference that's called the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| And I want to be very clear tonight that I'm not supporting something that puts an additional burden on our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| and on our budget in terms of the execution of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| I don't believe a general plan can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| I don't believe under the way the state law is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| I don't think it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Subsequent ordinances and regulations could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| They could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| First of all, I think my colleagues have expressed my feelings on a number of the issues about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| And, secondly, I know I've listened to our council, and I respect what Mr. Adams has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=6996)|
| 1:56:44| and I listen to county commission's council, and I listen to MPC's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| And I think Mr. Swanson was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| If you listen to a number of these lawyers, you'll just get more and more confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| But to me, the bottom line is this, is that there's been a group of folks that have worked on a plan for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7014)|
| 1:57:03| And as Councilman Bailey mentions, we owe it to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| But I think we also owe something to the folks that have worked on this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| And I think, Mr. Swanson, you made it clear that this is a plan that can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| So what I'm saying, folks, is let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| Let's get something on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| Mr. McAdams, the chamber can come back and ask for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| Council can ask for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| But I think it's time that we go ahead and approve this plan, knowing that it can be amended and all parts are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| And so I'm certainly going to support the plan as is, and I hope my colleagues will also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| I won't repeat some of the things that my colleagues have already said either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| But I would like to speak a little bit about the process that we just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| I thought it was a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| The entire city council and the entire county commission were welcome to come to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| Many of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| It was all laid out about there would be an end point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| It was facilitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| At the end point, we came up with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| Is the plan perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| But I think at some point you have to quit tinkering with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| And so having said that, I'm in favor of going forward and supporting the plan as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7095)|
| 1:58:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Well, I did make the substitute motion, and I'll make it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve the plan with the amendment added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| which I would like to share what I would like to take out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| Or what I would simply like to add in there is the plan and the principles, objectives, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| and guidelines included herein are advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| and will provide background and supplemental information as an advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| to serve as a guide to future MPC staff recommendations, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Would you repeat that, Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| It's in the commissioner's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| It's just scaled down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| It's the plan and the principles, objectives, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| and guidelines included herein are advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| and will provide background and supplemental information of an advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| and to serve as a guide to future MPC staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| Well, there's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| So I say that motion has died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| And it has been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| No, it's an old like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| It's an old like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Do you all want to take a voice vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| We're back to the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| That was on the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| I think we had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Who did second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| It has been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| Mayor, I just want to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| I appreciate the entire effort, and I think this is a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| I probably won't vote for it, but I do respect those that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| and all those that put it together and the hard work that went towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Mayor, just to clarify, we're voting on Resolution K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| It has been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| I thought we were voting on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| No, we're voting on the Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Original Resolution K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| I didn't get a second on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| But I thought 12B was the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| 12B is the original plan that was initiated by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| This is to refer it to MPC to consider the one that you all initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| I thought 11K was only the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| That's alternate 11K included the Briggs Amendment with 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| Unseconded motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| And that's what confused me with Chris's statement because we had the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| so I just wanted clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| November book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| It can be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| The Yachtler pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| I'm a Yachtler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Do we need to take that vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| You have the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| 11L is a resolution respectfully requesting the executive director and professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| of the Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission to study, analyze, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| make recommendations to City Council with respect to appropriate siting and permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| within boundaries of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| Well, I'm going to move this resolution, and if I might speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| And I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| We talked about this at our last meeting, and I think it's important since the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7355)|
| 2:02:42| of that facility in Fountain City has caused a fair amount of controversy and concern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| the neighbors as to what's going on, is it an appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| And that debate went on that we ask our professional planners to take a look at our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7372)|
| 2:02:58| It really only talks about permitting undertaking and funeral facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| It never mentions crematoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| There's no definitions in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| And I guess it reflects, in fact, the history that this was a very minor part of how bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7389)|
| 2:03:17| are ultimately disposed and buried or resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7397)|
| 2:03:26| And we really do need to have a little foresight on the front end so that if this comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| in the future, and I think it will because I think if one business has it, another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| will think they need to have it, that our zoning code is clear as to where these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| properly located, if there are setback requirements for proximity to residences or buffer zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| or special kinds of monitoring or equipment or whatever, that this all be thought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| and put in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Maybe it's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Maybe it's some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| But we hire professionals, and this city pays $905,000 a year to MPC to help us plan our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| And I think this is a step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| We ought to get them to go look at other codes in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| and come up with something that is helpful to Knoxville as we face these questions in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2011-2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| It says to cover the cost of acquiring the property near Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| Where is that property located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| Mr. King, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Oh, Councilmember Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Those properties are located on Alice Street adjacent to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| It's abutting the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| 12B is an ordinance approving the Knoxville-Knox County hillside and ridgetop protection plan dated October 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| which amends the Knoxville-Knox County general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| As a matter of clarity, I understand this to be the old original plan without any amendments that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7527)|
| 2:05:34| This is the one that was initiated by the MPC, where having sent the one that you all initiated to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7534)|
| 2:05:43| it would sort of seem inconsistent to me to then turn around and adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| But if that's what you want to do, you can legally adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| but then I don't think there's anything for MPC to do with the one that you sent to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| So if your action is somewhat logically consistent, my suggestion would be that it die for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7557)|
| 2:06:08| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| And to add further clarity, since I was the one that was confused before, we have not adopted a hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| I think that needs to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| We have sent back our version to MPC, but it still will need to come back in front of this body for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7580)|
| 2:06:30| And, you know, I would like to just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| I mean, in the plan it said it could be finalized at the December 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| so I'm assuming that it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| I want it to come back on an emergency basis so it can be finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| That will be up to you whether it gets passed on emergency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| It will come to you as an ordinance on first reading from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| It will not come to you on an emergency ordinance, but you may amend the ordinance to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| And then with six votes we can vote it as an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| I think you just want to make sure that MPC gets it back to us on the 13th, correct, Mr. Padley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| I think he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Right, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| We have it scheduled for our December 8th meeting, so there will be plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| A whole five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| There's no motion and no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| Ms. Mitchell, if we could move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| 12C is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| southwest side of North Concord Street from C6 to O1, Hatcher Hill Properties, LLC, Applicant 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7651)|
| 2:07:41| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| I was going to comment earlier when we were talking about the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| But I think that I want to congratulate Hatcher Hill for the opportunity of going into this area and doing this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7668)|
| 2:07:58| I think that it is a beginning of an area that has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| And I just want to commend them for looking at this, and hopefully this project will become reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| and will really address the needs of Sutherland Avenue from there all the way down to the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| So I just want to say congratulations, and I hope it goes forward and keep us posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| I don't know if Mr. Cadmus is still here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| I'm going to go back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| But one of the concerns that was raised in the record, I think it was a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| He indicated that if there was a residential structure near his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| that he would have a larger setback than he otherwise would if it was simply a commercial structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| It was pointed out during that MPC meeting or the appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| that the zone he will be adjacent to is an Office 1 zone and not a residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| so he would not get a bigger setback than he had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| I think he was concerned about that, and legitimately so, but he may not have picked up on that thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| But I think nothing we're doing right now is going to require him to have more setbacks than he had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| And I think that's important, because that would have been unfair to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| We do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| We have one person signed up for public forum, John Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7778)|
| 2:09:45| If you would come down, give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| No, I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| I heard people do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| We were talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| I met with those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| I already know any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| I was talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| I'm from Pollock, South Dakota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| I used to live here a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| And I'd like to wind this, give a little wind up here, an article dated November 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| from National Public Radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| The title of it is Supreme Court to Weigh Case of False Testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| And I'm not an attorney, and I was kind of surprised to find out that there's total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7823)|
| 2:10:33| immunity to the prosecutor in trial, but that the investigative phase is not immune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7833)|
| 2:10:48| In other words, what, let's say, the police do in the investigation is not immune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7848)|
| 2:10:56| And this particular article was about false indictments for harassment, aggravated assault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7856)|
| 2:11:08| and burglary on a bunch of doctors that were trying to open up an opposing surgical service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7868)|
| 2:11:15| in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| And they were wealthy and politically tied in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| And so they got, essentially, the cops to pull the stunt on these guys that were trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| to open up a competitive hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7887)|
| 2:11:36| And it was called abuse of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| And they're weighing immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| And I never thought that the game was played that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| I thought you had to be completely honest in court at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| and that when you were in front of a grand jury, you weren't pulling any fancy ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| But up until now, and this is what they're trying to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7917)|
| 2:12:04| is the prosecutor, as well as his agent, so to speak, immune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7924)|
| 2:12:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Then I go on to a blog, the law blog from the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| This was dated 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| So that's November 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| This is real new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| And then this one is 11-11-21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| So it was the 21st of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| And in this one, a sitting senator from Alaska was essentially got in trouble with some contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7965)|
| 2:13:03| and some dealings that he had with people that were, well, donors and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7983)|
| 2:13:12| And the senator was in a plane accident and got killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=7992)|
| 2:13:22| But I saw him on TV a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| And they were charging him, and they were after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| And here he was, the senator from Alaska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| And then this report comes out, kind of a preliminary to a 500-page report that's coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8016)|
| 2:13:44| And they kind of summarize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| And essentially they said the Justice Department was systematically permeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| The word was permeated by the systematic concealment of significant excalpatory evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8033)|
| 2:14:01| which would have independently corroborated his defense and his testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| I didn't think that they would be able to do that to a sitting senator from the United States from Alaska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8046)|
| 2:14:16| But they went through this whole procedure and eventually let him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| Now, there's a copy guy over here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| You distribute this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| Mr. Kirby, you have about one more minute for your public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| All right, well, I only have one copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| And this was a high crime that was committed here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| And let me say, I think the cops had facilitated this crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8081)|
| 2:14:53| And I wanted to be advised of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| And I wanted to take the proper steps to let everybody know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| And I would like to say that I would like to do what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8102)|
| 2:15:14| Well, we thank you very much for your statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| This was a serious high crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| And I think you should look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| We'll pick it up if you want to just leave it there on the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| And we'll get it and make sure that we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111129?start=8136)|
