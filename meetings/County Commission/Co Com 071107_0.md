| 0:00:00| Okay, I'd like to welcome everybody to the agenda committee, November 7, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| At this time, I'd like to ask Attorney General Randy Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=10)|
| 0:00:11| He had a couple of comments and concerns, I believe, about the pending office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=11)|
| 0:00:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=18)|
| 0:00:19| And I appreciate you calling me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| I acknowledge my wife, Laura, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| We're on our way to we have a funeral of the mother of my former law partner, Ralph Harwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| My great friend died in the funerals at two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=28)|
| 0:00:30| So I appreciate you giving me consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| Let me address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| I was reading for the first time this morning the opinion of Chancellor Darrell Fantzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=36)|
| 0:00:43| the opinion that talked about the effort for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| And I have even a better appreciation for the circumstances that we're all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| And so I do not envy your task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| And I point out that even the court said that it was he was mindful of the extraordinary circumstances involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=63)|
| 0:01:12| the county government of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| The court is aware that many of the citizens of the county would prefer that these vacancies be filled by election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| rather than by appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| The court is mindful that an election would be more palatable to both the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| and the public and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| The court is also aware that the appointment process places a heavy burden upon the remaining 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| Now, that's a direct quote from the opinion of Chancellor Fantzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| And I have a deep appreciation and respect for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| So I guess I'm here to add to your burden today because, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, we need a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=108)|
| 0:02:01| And I say that with some trepidation in that I hope that nobody would take my remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| to mean any disparaging comment on Tom Spangler, the acting sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| My comments are not to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I've known Tom Spangler for a very long period of time and hold him in high regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| So my comments are not directed to any person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| It's to the larger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I would point out that there are a number of things that are well underway that we have been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| And the sheriff of Knox County is a central player, some of which involve the new safety center that we're designing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=156)|
| 0:02:45| with the help of Helen Ross McNabb to divert the mentally ill from the jails in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| This could be of tremendous savings to these taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| And we'll all be safer if we know where these people that come in and out of the system are and we can direct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| It will be much, much better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| We're talking now about treatment facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| We now have some room at the detention facility out east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| You know, we've merged the ladies have been taken over to the new wing that was recently opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| And we have the annex now that we believe can be used to do anger management, drug and alcohol, GED classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| So when you are a guest of Knox County, we can see that you do something to improve your lot in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| That's underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| We have other things that are close to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| And when we start talking, I say we, that's when the criminal justice part of the government, we start talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| and planning that involves spending taxpayer monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And I would urge you to have a sheriff, an appointed sheriff, not an acting sheriff, an appointed sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=233)|
| 0:04:04| that can be at the table and can make decisions and can stand behind those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| and use the force of the office of sheriff for the betterment of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| It is simply not working very well, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| And I believe that will be to the detriment of every citizen in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| I urge you to appoint a sheriff so we can go back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| and do what needs to be done to see that we're safe and deliver these services at the lowest possible tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you for hearing me this afternoon, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| Okay, Mr. General, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| And our sympathy goes to your friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Mrs. Nichols, it's always good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Does anybody have any questions for the general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| General, on this acting sheriff, you're a lawyer and a prosecutor, too, both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| But this really wouldn't be classified as Knox County having a sheriff, would it, when we say they're acting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| Well, I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| You can't find much law in it that we don't have anything to really go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| and look at strong, Commissioner, to, you know, to make some of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Clearly, there would be a point in time, I would think, to be contemplated for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| There could be an acting sheriff until you could make other arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| But in this situation, with the order of the court as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| then I believe that it's certainly within the power of this commission to appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| And I just urge you to take that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| But what I was talking about, you know, the Constitution says that each county has to have a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| It does not say an acting sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I just want to tell you I really appreciate you coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| I've told the chairman when I called him to ask if I could appear that I'm not trying to put my big nose in your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=353)|
| 0:06:04| That's not my function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| But I believe it is my function when we start talking about public safety in the county of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| to let my views be known to the body that's in charge of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| And I appreciate the opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| And I appreciate the job you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you, General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Yes, I'd just like to comment on the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| You know, I do not want to make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| I do not want to have to go through what we went through with January 31st again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| But I ran for a job, and that job has certain responsibilities with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| And I believe that one of our responsibilities, since we have not been allowed the option of a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| I believe that it's our responsibility to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| I think that in accordance with Chancellor Fensler's ruling, we need to do that in a very open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| where the public and potential candidates have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| But I believe that it is absolutely our job to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| And I believe that if we do not make these appointments, we are neglecting our duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| and not holding up our oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| So I believe that what we need to do is that we need to meet on, I think, November 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| the way we have a meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| And we need to come up with a good, open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| And we need to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| And I'd like to hear your all's thoughts on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| But I just think we're on very, very shaky ground constitutionally right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| The people of my district are partially disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| The way this government is set up, they are supposed to have two voices on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Yet now they only have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Now that might be fair if everyone else, if every district was cut along the same lines, but it's not that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=485)|
| 0:08:14| We have some districts, we have a couple of districts that have full representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| They have both of their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| We have the fifth districts that short one of their representatives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| And then we have the fourth district that doesn't have any representation whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| And so I believe that as uncomfortable as it's going to be, that we need to step up to the plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| and we need to do the job that we were elected to do and we need to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| And, again, I'd like to hear what the rest of you guys have to think about that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| and just see what your thoughts are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| The first item we have is consideration of resolution of the County Commission of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| honoring the Farragut boys' soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Does anybody have any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=540)|

| 0:09:15| Commissioner Hammond put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=556)|

| 0:09:22| The third item is consideration of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=562)|

| 0:09:33| Do we have any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=573)|

| 0:11:06| John, Mr. Owings, I would like for you to comment, I suppose, on these stormwater maintenance covenants in that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=666)|
| 0:11:24| don't quite understand why we get why we're having these right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| I don't understand the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And I'm wondering if, and I'm somewhat concerned that there is some liability to homeowners in terms of stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=693)|
| 0:11:45| facilities that they do not realize in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| And I'm not well informed on this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| but somehow I am suspicious that somebody is going to be stuck with a bill that they're not aware that is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=716)|
| 0:12:09| Do you have any experience with the covenants and what it could, the repercussions for future residents of said timbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=729)|
| 0:12:25| whatever, this timbers outlet, Villas at Timber Lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| Am I being suspicious for no reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| You know, the covenants are whatever they say that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| And if I had one of these in their pretty standard boilerplate, they're required by law to be approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=759)|
| 0:12:50| Pretty standard boilerplate language in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I don't have one in front of me, but we will in our packets on the 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| and we can talk more about it then, about the details of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| I believe whenever I read the charter that this is a matter that has to come before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| and that's why we have them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| But as far as where the responsibilities lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Could you check one of the covenants and with a special eye out for a property owner in one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=804)|
| 0:13:34| And with the question, with that question, is there a liability in the future that is unforeseen or potentially unforeseen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=814)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| We will let you know next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Mr. Law Director, if somebody is buying a house, I'm assuming that's in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| is that fully disclosed with the real estate agent, do people know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| It would be on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| As commissioner, I think somebody is going to buy a house down the road two or three times later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| when it finally happens and nobody knows that they're stuck with that huge bill to clean that hole out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| That would, you know, all future maintenance requirements for the detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| or basins or, you know, things that are not just structurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| not just the structural capital costs up front, just hidden costs or future costs, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=873)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Yeah, I would assume that Timber Outlets Investment would pass that on to the new property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| But they're not going to pass it on to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| Okay, item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=900)|

| 0:15:53| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| Commissioner Ballard, you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Mr. Chairman, I guess this is only for half the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| I mean, are we not going to be doing anything for the last half of our year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| Well, that would be a question to, I guess, maybe we can ask the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Does anybody here from the Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=980)|
| 0:16:30| What it is, it's an increase in the amount from what it is now to the $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| So it takes us through the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| It's an increase for that half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| So it's a calendar year instead of our fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| How much of an increase is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| No, it's about $65,000 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Is that right, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| About $50,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| We believe it's $265,000 now, so we've gone to $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Is there any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| So this contract is a calendar year contract instead of our budgetary contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| Apparently so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| What we have to review and present to commission is just for this period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| and it's really just increasing the amount from what it is now to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| So will we have a new contract starting January 1-08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| This will replace the amount in the contract is what it is from the $265,000 to the $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| It will just be an amendment of that one section in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| It's amendment one to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| Okay, any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1073)|

| 0:18:32| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| And anyone in the audience, if you have a question, too, you can come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| Item number 14, resolution of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1123)|

| 0:18:58| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I guess this is money that's being donated from the good people out there that use the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| It's not county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| We do have $70,000 in our budget for construction of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| We're estimating it's going to be around $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| So the community out there has raised $30,000 to help pay for these facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1166)|

| 0:19:40| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Are you short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Are you just ahead on the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I'm sorry, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Are you just ahead on the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Do you need the money now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Are you shorting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| What they did when they set up the capital plan, they actually had the money spread over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| And amazingly enough, we're actually on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| So we're needing just to tab it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| They figured it would be spread out a little bit longer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| So John Troyer has just moved this money from next year and then we'll reduce next year's amount by the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Item number 16, resolution of the county commission, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1212)|

| 0:20:24| South Knoxville, purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Go ahead, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Mike Reeves, Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| As you're aware, this particular resolution was deferred from October commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1232)|
| 0:20:41| It's of our opinion since the last meeting that apparently there's been a new resolution placed before you by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| Pinkston, number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| And it's of our opinion that perhaps you should consider putting those together as merging those together as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| The first one, number 16, was determining a method of disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| and 29 is approving a lease to Torah Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| If that meets your approval, Commissioner Pinkston or any other member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| Just for your consideration, they appear to be similar in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| Can't sell it if we're going to lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| So do we want the wording to be like 16 or like 29?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Just determining the method, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| You don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Paul, is that all right with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Just go ahead and combine those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| The word disposal means to get rid of and, you know, if we lease it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| if we're not disposing of it, it's still county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I guess what we need to decide is do we want to lease it to these folks or do we want to go ahead and sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| There was some question about whether a lease can be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Right, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| There is, but, you know, I don't know why all of a sudden this question has arisen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| because we've done the same thing for rural high school over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| This school itself was leased to the carpenter's union for years there, and they've moved out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| But it was leased to them for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| So I don't know why all of a sudden we have a problem with releasing it when we've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1344)|
| 0:22:35| Is that okay, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Is it okay if we lease the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| It's not all of a sudden that we've had a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Legally, we've always had a problem with leasing county property because there are a number of liability issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| that you just can't shed by an agreement with any entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| Now, the rural high school situation is a matter that was actually a school property, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| Knox County Schools leased that to an association for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| and that was over the objection of then law director Richard Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| Can it be leased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Sure, you can lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| It would not be your lawyer's recommendation that you would lease the property because of the liabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| that are associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| But you certainly have the power to do that if you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| Mr. Law Director, do we have any property that we leased to anyone that's Knox County property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| We have a school in South Knoxville that we lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| I want to say that they put a roof on the building, and that is to the remote area medical group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1438)|
| 0:24:10| They are a non-profit organization that certainly serves a, I would think, somewhat of a governmental purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1450)|
| 0:24:21| That building is leased to them for a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| That and the rural high school lease are, and someone can correct me on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| but those are the only two that I'm aware of that are leases to non-profit type organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| Didn't we lease some land to the rugby folks last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| I mean, I was just curious as to how those were different or how they were similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Well, I said you had it within your power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| When you start talking about buildings, you're talking about a building, the Galbraith School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| which, as I understand it, has a negative appraisal value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| And part of that is because of the asbestos situation that lies within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| And, you know, there are certain liabilities that go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| Last month, there was a lease that was approved to lease a ball field, as I understand it, to a rugby outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1525)|
| 0:25:36| That lease is still being negotiated, and we have not come to a resolution of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1536)|
| 0:25:46| So that lease is not yet in stone, but we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| There may be other situations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| You know, if the question is, does this body have the power to lease Knox County property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| The answer is yes, so long as you do it in a non-discriminatory manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| You know, I would add that you ought to at least lease Knox County property, if you're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| to an organization that is a not-for-profit, to an organization that serves a governmental purpose or need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1575)|
| 0:26:23| And I think we've pretty much accomplished that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1583)|
| 0:26:33| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Can we not word it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I mean, it's our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Can we not word the lease that it would hold us harmless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Oh, sure, you can say anything in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| But, you know, does it actually do that is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Do you accomplish what it is that you wish to accomplish by the words that you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| And that isn't always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| It isn't always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| That doesn't prevent you from being sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| You can say whatever it is you wish to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| But, you know, everybody who wishes to sue, if it were TOR Ministries or whoever else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| who wishes to sue that organization, that's whether you're an employee or you're a participant through their ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| If they wish to sue TOR Ministries, they're going to sue Knox County, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| So that doesn't prevent us from being involved in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Let me ask a question to Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| In your opinion of the bill, is it what kind of shape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I don't know what the bill is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Do we need to keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Is it in real bad shape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| No, it's in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| But they're agreeing to go in and redo this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| It needs a lot of work done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And they're set up with the electrical union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| They're going to be teaching children how to do crates, how to do crates and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| And they're set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| As a matter of fact, I thought I faxed everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Now, if this property has a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| They've got to reach criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| We want it in the lease where they have to reach certain parts of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| This has to be done at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| The exterior needs to be finished next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Normally, Larry, you've been in the insurance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| When people lease property, whoever owns that property makes these people take out a large insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| To protect theirself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Well, I'm. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I mean, I'm sure that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Like you say, you can sue people for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| But normally, for your protection, you make whoever is leasing the property from you take an insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Well, the way I look at it, I mean, they can sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| If we've got it. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| If our law department has got it worded the way it needs to be worded, then let them try to sue us if we're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| Well, and if this property has a negative value, I'm assuming that means it would cost more to clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| than it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| What if we just gave them the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| It's a big asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| But if it's an asset that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I mean, is it really worth. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Would it really cost more to repair the building than it's worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Would it really cost more to take care of the asbestos problem than. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| If we put it up for auction, would it bring any money or would we have to pay someone to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| I hate to lose any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| I mean, it's going to be worth quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Well, I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1757)|
| 0:29:17| I just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| But, I mean, I just worry that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| They're going to bear the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| That would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| They're going to bear the cost of repairing this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| They're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Repair it theirself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| And we need to set guidelines on they have to have this done the next amount of time, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| And then, still, that would be our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| If they fall short of repairing this building, then it's going to revert back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| And they repair it to our North County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Yes, it will have to be brought up to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Well, that's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| City code, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| It's actually the schools in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| They're in for a fun time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Well, then, if that's what this body wishes to do, I mean, there needs to be some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| And speaking of meeting, a meeting of the minds where, you know, what does this body wish to impose upon Torah ministries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1794)|
| 0:30:05| Do we want them to fix one room at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Which one room at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| What do we want to require them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| And if they don't fulfill those requirements, then what provisions do you wish to utilize to reclaim the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| They're going to have an investment in the building at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Are they going to surrender their investment if they haven't fulfilled all of the timelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Or, you know, we can do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We can accomplish all that, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| But it's going to take a couple of meetings in order to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| That will be your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| I expect you to protect Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| And that's exactly what I've been sworn to do, which is what I will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| But you're not going to do that in a couple of days, a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| We need to know from this body what it is that you expect for Torah industries to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| So it starts here and it starts with guidance from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| This is certainly a worthy project, and I've talked to the gentleman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| But I'm going to come to the defense of the law director a little bit since I do handle claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| Oh, I'm okay defending myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| He certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| But really what he's saying in layman terms is you cannot absolve yourself of inherent future risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| If you go over here to the fair and make something simple, you buy a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| On the back of the ticket it says, not responsible for injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| That will not hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| And this is a situation that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| If the property can, you know, you have a duty to warn the, I guess, leaser of any risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| And property like this, you can't possibly know all the risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| And you can put in any known, unknown, foreseen, unforeseen, and all these hold harmless agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| And if they choose to sue, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| And a lot of this is not based on legalese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| If you have a young person that's hurt, brain trauma, damaged, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| juries are sympathetic to something like that, and the judge may be too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| He won't let you out even though it's legal to let you out in these catastrophe type of injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| So a lease is not the most favorable way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Now, we may decide to do that, but you will not absolve yourself of all liability if we choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1953)|
| 0:32:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I definitely think that we need to keep these as separate issues, but discuss them close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| But one thing I'd like to know before our committee meetings is I'd like to know the actual value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| If it has a ñ when I hear negative value, what I'm assuming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| and I've went out and looked at a few cars that had a negative value where, you know, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| you know, I wouldn't pay you for it, but if you'll give me $50, I'll have it hauled off for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| And I'm wondering, is that the situation this property is in, or does it have any monetary value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| Mike, what was the appraisal for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| There was an appraisal done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| No, I don't at this point in time, but I certainly will get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| And I've made note of that, and we will provide that before you meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| It was a negative 20-some-odd thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| In that range, but I don't remember exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| $26,000, negative 26, somewhere in that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Which if it, you know, if it, I mean, this property would probably certainly qualify for a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| so that some value could be brought into it to help repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| And I will provide that for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| If it would be okay if we take number 16 off and we leave 29 on, would that serve the same purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2047)|
| 0:34:16| I wonder if we could get an appraisal, the county could get an appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| and see if they might like to buy it if it's a very nominal amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| Well, we would have to auction it off, I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Go to the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And with a negative value, the highest bidder may be, I'll take it if you give me 20 grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| We can put an RFP out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Yeah, an RFP would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Is it all right with the commission if we take number 16 off, withdraw it, and we leave 29 on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Yeah, let's take 16 off and leave 29 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| That way we can, if we decide to do the lease, we do the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| If we decide not to, we can bring back 16 in the December meeting, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| Well, I mean, it was deferred from October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Sixteen was deferred from October, so it is automatically on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Well, we can take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Can we withdraw it at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Well, we could defer it in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| You don't have a vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Could we just leave it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| We withdraw both of them, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| until you get a chance to see about a lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| I thought the chairman could take things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| This is an item that was deferred and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It has to remain, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| I think it remains on for the commission to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Well, why don't we just have Joe Lee make sure that this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Or else you would have just withdrawn it at the last meeting and not deferred it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Well, what if we just leave both of them on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Just leave them both on is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Leave them both on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| If we can have Joe Lee make sure that they're next to each other and be a packet on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| so that they're items next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| We'll just leave both of them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| And we're on number 17 in the Resolution County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2157)|

| 0:37:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2231)|

| 0:37:17| Back up to number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Do I understand this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| We're going to buy somebody a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Looks like we're going to construct a house for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| It's federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| It's federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| It's pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I mean, they're going to pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| I just think that would be better done by a private charity like Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| But if it ain't our money, I guess we'll pass it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| Does that need to be in there that they're going to be paying it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| It is a private charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Is it Habitat that's doing this or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Tennessee Conference Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Who is Tennessee Conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Who determines who gets to buy this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Tennessee Conference Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| I'm sure if they go through the same qualifying provisions that you would with a Habitat house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Do they have public funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Most of us have been involved with that to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And you have to work on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And you end up, you know, paying back, at least according to your income, most of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2305)|
| 0:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Do we have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I'm just saying that there were several organizations that applied for the grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| and they were the ones that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Cynthia will be here Monday or Tuesday to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| I think it's still her department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2333)|

| 0:41:26| is that it's Zero Dandridge Avenue and Zero Valina Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| I don't believe everything you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2491)|

| 0:41:50| It makes a horseshoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| It goes in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Right there, right across from Marybeth's, the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| As long as we get a map of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Now, Commissioner Pinkson may take a picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| We really need to know on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| You know, they tell you lots of times it's a small, partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| We need to know, and I stress this once in a time, we need to know how many square feet are in these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| You know, some of these lots could possibly be buildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| that we're giving away for a little bit of nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| and then some of them could be useless to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| You know, so we really need to know the square feet they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| And the value of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Item 26, approved contract with the Community Television and Auxilio Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| for Community Access Programming, Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| We got money going out to that or just a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| It's a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| It's a five-year agreement with two five-year renewal periods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| very similar to what you have approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| 27, resolution of the county commission approving an actuary study in the amount of $350 for TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| for those elected officials considering transferring to TCRS in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| 28, resolution of the county commission approving a contract with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| to lease a portion of the property located at 400 State Street for downtown recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| 29, consideration of the county commission approving a lease with Old Gilbreath School to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2612)|
| 0:43:44| We've already discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Number 30, resolution of the county commission directing the remaining funds appropriate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| South Knox Senior Center to remain in the senior center fund for their use, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Do we know how much that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| I've been checking into it, and the most I can find out is it looks like we still have somewhere around $115,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| to $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Now, we got $250,000 from Duncan, Jimmy Duncan, and the lady at ADA helped some over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2653)|
| 0:44:23| and she got us I don't know how much money, but I think there's about $115,000 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Now, we only got South Knoxville through the county $1,225,000 appropriated for our senior center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2668)|
| 0:44:37| in which all the others got quite a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| So I do want to say that since we went to the government and got these monies to help us with ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| that it stays with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Do they have a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Yes, we're doing things over there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| We're studying about building a pavilion over there, which the state had offered us a grant on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| but somehow it fell through the cracks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| But the county, they didn't apply for it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And we're wanting to build a small walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Maybe use some of this money to later add on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| We may have to add on to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| But we need an awning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Isn't the South Knoxville, aren't they the one that got the swim pool for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| With no lifeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Swim pools are expensive to operate, and I just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Well, we put a salt system on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Yes, they're still expensive to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| I was just wondering if they needed it for that or the operating costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| or if they actually had some capital they were going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| What we're wanting this for is to be sure that it stays with our senior center because it is our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| I'm just curious if they had a plan for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| Yes, we have some plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| As a matter of fact, the mayor, you're welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| I'll be addressing some things over there at 330 today that we're going to use some of this money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Item number 31, resolution of the commission, Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| requiring commission to choose the appointee when a commissioner is to be appointed to a board or committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| How is that different from what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| What the commissioners pick some now and what the mayor has at work now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| No, I think this is when a commissioner is to be appointed to a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| What kind of board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Any board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| This is like the 9-1-1 board tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| You know, we nominate and select who we want to serve on the 9-1-1 board as our representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| And I think that any board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| You mean county boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Yes, county boards, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| But I think that any board here that any commissioner is going to serve on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| that every district should be allowed to vote for the person they want to serve on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| instead of somebody else picking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| We have a lot of these boards that different people just pick and say they want so-and-so on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| But everybody in every district should have a say-so on who they want to go on these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Do we not vote as a group, though, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Normally they're just picked and, you know, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| We have no say-so on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| I think that what I'm trying to say in this resolution here is if you want to pick so-and-so for X amount of board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| instead of that, you just need to tell the chairperson that they want a commissioner and us select that commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| Well, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| I'm just trying to figure out how that's different from when we appoint someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Well, normally we're told who people want, you know what I mean, that are picking the boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| And this way it just keeps everybody straight and everybody in every district has a say-so on who goes on these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| Well, I think that ought to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| You know, when they're going to be representing the commission on that board, they need to be approved by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| Paul, could you give another example besides 9-1-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| Like what's another board that where a commissioner is appointed to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| and that becomes an issue for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Right now we have the, let's just take the ethics deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| The ethics panel, that's a board, too, that we've got people on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| But we appointed, didn't we appoint the commissioners that were on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Not every commissioner, no, sir, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| But you and Mike Hammond were appointed by this commission to be on that ethics committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| I believe that if you check into it, you'll see that Commissioner Hammond was selected by someone else, and we voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| But personally, I don't like being on the ethics committee, and you're welcome to take my place if this committee will elect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| Not a chance, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| I just feel like that everybody on any board that serves off this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| it should be the commission's responsibility for us to pick who we want to go on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| where that way they're represented, every district is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| That would only be where it doesn't conflict with the charter, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Under the charter, there is a list of boards and commissions that are appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2942)|
| 0:49:13| Some we have to serve on, like Scott has to serve on some of these things because he's a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| But we can't rule against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| I'm just talking about anything that we have coming up in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Under the mayor's duties, he appoints members of all boards, authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| and commissions not delegated by the charter to appointment by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| There are a few requirements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| But then there are other requirements in the charter, like a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| which the, you know, there is a process that we go through in that instance where the mayor appoints by proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2982)|
| 0:49:57| The mayor would appoint nine, you know, a commissioner from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| So you couldn't conflict with that provision because that's the mayor's appointment unless you wish to change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| Well, we can with charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3011)|
| 0:50:20| Well, until then, you've done a wonderful job on ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Now, remember, I want you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| I want everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Everybody needs to come to one of these ethics boards committees and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Every commissioner here needs to be there to see what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Knox County Sheriff's Department Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| I don't see 911 on here for a commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| CTV, isn't CTV supposed to have a commission representative on their board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| We do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| You know, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Mark Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Mark Harmon is on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I want to say Hammond is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| I don't remember voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| I know Harmon is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Hammond is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| There's somebody else at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| I'm on it, but I'm from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Which board are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| I don't remember voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| I'm thinking about the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| I'm on cable TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I serve on the TTCDA and I believe Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| I was interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Appointed me to like the TTCDA because we get one commissioner that gets to serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| And I don't remember if I was, if we voted on that as a body or if it was just chairmen appointed me to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| And the governor appointed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Yeah, and you haven't darkened the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Got out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| John, this question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I don't want to go against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I don't know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Any of these new boards that are formed, which we seem to be forming them every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| that don't fall under the charter, I just think that we should have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Anything that goes against our charter or the Constitution of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| I'm expecting you to inform us of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| But we create a lot of committees and boards here all the time that don't fall in under these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| And I just think that we should have the say-so on who goes on them if there's going to be someone from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| I just want to add the language that for those boards that don't already have conflicts with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3150)|
| 0:52:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| No, I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And I still want to know how, but when we voted on the CTV appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| And when we do it, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| But let's list, Mr. Law Director, if you'll give us a list of which boards that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| They're in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| I'll tell you exactly where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| It is in Section 2.02i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| How many are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| A lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| But if anything comes up, you'll inform us whether or not it's in the charter that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| we're basically going to be talking about any new boards or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Are you talking about a special committee somebody would form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Is this outside the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I mean, you're on the committee within the commission already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I'm talking about anything that they come up here and they're forming another committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| or a board that they ask the commissioner to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| I think the commissioners here could vote on who they want to serve on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| I'm on a lot of these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I'm sure people would rather I not be on, you know, so this will be your chance to get rid of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Let's talk about this one more second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Section 3.03h of the charter provides that it is the mayor's duties to appoint members of all boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3237)|
| 0:54:08| authorities, and commissions not delegated by the charter to appointment by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Well, we know what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| All appointees shall be residents of Knox County at the time of their appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and at all times while serving on said board, authority, or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Such members may be removed and discharged for good cause shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Now, there's no requirement right there that the mayor has to delegate his responsibility of choosing commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3266)|
| 0:54:40| to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| And I'm afraid what you may run against there is a separation of powers argument where your legislative body is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| going to impose on your county executive some of the executive's prerogative by the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3289)|
| 0:54:58| So, I mean, I think the resolution is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Let's change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| We may have some charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| I think there will be a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| We can always put together a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| We've got one that's going to be considered this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| It goes on automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Number 32, consideration, resolution, Knox County adopting recommendations of the ethics committee regarding nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Mr. Law Director, do you have a copy of that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| It is very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| It is almost precisely what is in the, yes, I do have it, but I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| It is almost precisely what is in the Knox County employee's handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| But with this resolution, it would require, it would impose this requirement on elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3352)|
| 0:56:01| Would it make it, would it limit who was eligible to run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| No, not this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It just, that's a different provision that will be coming up in later months, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| But this one is strictly a nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| And like I say, it's almost precisely what is in the handbook now, the Knox County employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| except this will only apply to elected officials that you cannot supervise, superintend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| that you cannot in any way assist a family member, and that is defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3395)|
| 0:56:44| It's well defined in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| You can't assist them in any way or help them gain employment with the county or a raise or anything of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3409)|
| 0:57:02| So it holds elected officials to somewhat of a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| What if someone in your family got a job and people say, oh, he done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| This would be a, it's an amendment to the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| And it would make it a violation of the ethics policy for any elected official to try to assist a family member in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3440)|
| 0:57:30| gaining employment with or continued employment with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| And that's some of the things it would inhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Is it clear on what you could do and what you could not do or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| You can't do anything to promote family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| You're saying that they could be somebody and how far does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| Second cousin, third cousin, divorced wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| You know, I mean, I don't know what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| But if it did happen, you're going to have some people in this community say, he must have called somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| So is there a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| And they could file an ethics complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| That's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| But it does make it clear on the relationship to the official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| It's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| And it gets into foster parent-child relations and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| How does this relate to right-to-work laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Is there a conflict there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| I mean, if a grown person is seeking employment, do we have the right to bar them from having employment with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3504)|
| 0:58:36| Because they may or may not have a relative that happens to be an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| And would this prevent a potential employee from using an elected official as a reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3525)|
| 0:58:54| Only if you're a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| You'd be held to a different standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| Or foster kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Or foster kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Or you could be a guardian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I believe that is also in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Someone living in your household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Would it have to be someone living within your household then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Because even the conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| No, it could be any of those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Because the conflict of interest disclosure form that we have to turn over to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3562)|
| 0:59:30| when it talks about dependents, talks about, or children, talks about those living in your household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3570)|
| 0:59:38| Like my son has a part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| He lives in my household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| I disclose where he works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| And, in fact, I just updated it because he got a new job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| So, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| You could not, under this nepotism policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| you could not in any way try to influence any hiring decision of your family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| Well, would that include even school personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I mean, that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Well, now, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I guess they can still apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| You just can't be a reference for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I guess if you're not a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| I guess you get into this whole thing that says, how do you prove a negative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| How do you prove that someone didn't, that you did not help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| And you become front story on the new Sentinel front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| You're arguing with a nepotism policy in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| I mean, we have a nepotism policy already for the employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| You do in the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| You do in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| And that is you cannot supervise a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| So, we already have a nepotism policy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| We already have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| We already have a nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| This is an additional policy that imposes a requirement upon elected officials that are covered by the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| to not in any way attempt to influence any employment decision related to their relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3664)|
| 1:01:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Let me see if I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| So, just using this as an example, a director in the administration could have, say, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3678)|
| 1:01:28| He has two sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| He could have them working in parks and regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| He's not an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| That's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| But these are still people who could influence people to give their people jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3693)|

| 1:01:43| He's not an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| This policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Advisors or directors of any office could have them working somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| This policy applies to elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| That's what is on your plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| What if someone becomes an elected official and they already have a relative working for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3716)|
| 1:02:07| Somebody's got to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I don't think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| I think you're going to find yourself in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| That's not what this provision is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Oh, but to one coming, maybe you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Well, I don't think you can bar someone from running for office either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| Basically, we're just taking the existing Knox County policy and applying it to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| or other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| And extending that policy to any and all hiring decisions, employment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| Which we don't do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Related to their relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Is this similar to the city's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Is that where this came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| I do not know if it is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| I haven't looked at the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| This is a policy that was created by Commissioner Hammond for review by the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3776)|
| 1:03:09| It has been reviewed and approved, and it is being submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Did they have discussion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Could we have the minutes of the discussion put in our packets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| I don't know if you could or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| I don't know that their minutes are typed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| There will be a tape recording of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Could we get somebody to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| See, they're going to meet tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| If they approve the minutes from the previous meeting tomorrow morning, then we'll have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Have somebody, I guess, put them down on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| The minutes will be on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Since we're having a meeting tomorrow, we should have the minutes in time for your committee meetings next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| If they could go out in our packets that we'd have over the weekend to see exactly what their comments were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| If the Secretary of the Ethics Committee has put together the minutes, we'll have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Number 33 is a consideration resolution of the county commission instructing the Knox County Law Director to prepare a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| charter amendment to be presented to Knox County Commission at its December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| outlining a procedure for a special election option should commission be presented with the appointing two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| or more elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Based on this right here, how can we go against the Constitution on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3878)|
| 1:04:49| The state of Tennessee calling for a special election when you've seen this judge just rule that we can't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| The Attorney General in Nashville ruled that on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| And there's three places in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| We go back to Article 7, Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| It tells you that we're to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| You go down to Section 4 in the same article there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| And it says the legislature does not have the power to go against anything that's specified that we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| in this Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| And the word shall means that we have to appoint these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| It doesn't say may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| It says shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| So that's a directive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| And then you go back to Article 11, Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| And it states the only way they can do anything like that is to have two-thirds votes in Nashville to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| If they amend, alter, or abolish anything in the Constitution, they have to have two-thirds of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| And then it has to be bought for the people to vote on to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| So how can we pass things like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| My understanding is that Knox County cannot go against the Constitution, even though we are a charter county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3953)|
| 1:06:02| just like the state cannot go against anything in the United States Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| And we're not going to go against the Constitution of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| This definitely requires more study than we have already because this has never been proposed as a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3972)|
| 1:06:20| But it will get back to, you know, what are the county's powers through the enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| It gets back to the Jordan decision where the court, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| sheds more light on what the powers are of counties to impose additional requirements on the citizenry of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=3992)|
| 1:06:45| And it's going to take more study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| I don't have an answer for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Well, the Jordan decision did not go against the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| We know we're in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| It actually cited the Constitution and said that this was the responsibility of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| This is just outright against what the Constitution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| Well, now, we could combine this with 35 that is requesting that Senator Burchett attempt the same thing on the state level, couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| Senator Burchett does not have the power to do that, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| He has to get two-thirds of the vote to change the Constitution down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Then it has to become before the whole state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Well, yeah, but that's what 35 is in reference to in asking him to pursue this within the state senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| Well, it says to mandate a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| They cannot mandate one until the Constitution is changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| You just went through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| How well you should know it on what pass or rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Well, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| I mean, I understand what our responsibility is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| What I'm saying is that while I have a question like the law director of whether we can do this with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| we have a similar amendment with a similar thing on the agenda with 35 basically having a resolution asking Senator Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4077)|
| 1:08:09| and I would hope we would include Senator Woodson in that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| and ask them to see if this could be changed everywhere on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| And I think that might be a wiser way to pursue this since the state has the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| Commissioner Lambert, it can be changed everywhere on the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| but the people of the state of Tennessee have to vote it in after the legislature gets two-thirds of the vote down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| It has to go on the ballot for the whole state of Tennessee to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Yeah, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| I understand that, and that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| But I think that in place of 33, we should look at 35, because 35 is pursuing a, is pursuing this on the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4119)|
| 1:08:50| and the state is where the authority lies for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| I'd like to add that I like Paul's argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| I feel like he's been studying under Murphy and Kleinfelder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| No, I mean, Paul's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| We do not, I don't see that we have the authority to do this with the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| This is going to have to be done on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| You know, in my mind, I think we're spending a lot of time on something that's probably never going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| You know, we have a lot of things we need to be helping our kids in this community with schools, law enforcement at parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| and recreation, and, you know, we've got work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| And we'll have plenty of time to discuss this come Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I'll be glad to do the research on it and give you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| 34 is a resolution of the Knox County Commission accepting a report of the Pellissippi Research Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| It's Commissioner Hammond and the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Do you know anything about that, Mr. Aldrich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| 35 is a resolution of the county commission, Tennessee Colony and Foreign State Senator Tim Berger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| to introduce legislation in the next legislative session to mandate special election specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| Those elections procedures when it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Go back to 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| 34, that's the Blount County money, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Isn't that the Blount County money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| That's the $5 million that Knox County committed to Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| So there's going to be a report on how that project has proceeded and how Knox County's money has been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| That's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| And the other one is procedures of an election or vacancies that occur in elective offices of any Tennessee county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| Commissioner Harmon put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| And, you know, that's one of those things where I'm sure Senator Burchett and Senator Woodson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| they're going to be looking at the Attorney General to see what guidance they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Obviously, they could put this on the agenda for the state on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| I feel that it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| This would just be us expressing an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Number 36, Resolution of the County Commission, placing a recall amendment to the Knox County Charter on the August 2008 ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Commissioner Lambert and Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| That will be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| That will not be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| That will be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| John, you know, we have a recall amendment in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| It's specified for county commissioners to be done by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| How is this going to differ from the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Well, but there's not a state law that, I mean, there's a state law that says you can adopt a recall amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| in accordance with the language that's in the state statute, which is what we intend to put before you is what's in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| It's not going to be exactly like that proposed by this gentleman right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| The city of Knoxville has a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| The city of Knoxville doesn't fall in under the constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| I know, but they do have a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| And I was just wondering if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Well, our charter says we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I don't know what it is, but it says we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Yeah, I'm just wondering if we have the authority to take a look at theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| and see if that's something that we might want to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Also, we have an ouster law, too, in Knoxville here that we have a way to throw people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| And I've been reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| It looks like you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I'm one of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| And the state attorney general, if any citizen will spring a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| you all have to show them the process about how to go through it and do it and help them with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Or the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I said the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| I thought I did anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Well, the attorney general and the district attorney are different, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| But there are, yes, there are three officials that may bring an ouster action or ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4365)|
| 1:12:54| Well, I'm for a recall amendment if we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| But I want to know what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| I want to know the specifics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| The gentleman that's at the mic, are you, is it Payone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Mr. Payone has emailed me a copy of a recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| And we've been looking at that as well as the statutes that apply, the charter, the state constitution, the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4391)|
| 1:13:22| And we'll be able to advise you next Tuesday as to, you know, all the legalities of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4402)|
| 1:13:33| But there is a state statute that lays out kind of a basic boilerplate recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| And I think that we want to closely track what is in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| what has been established by our legislature as the method of recalling officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4427)|
| 1:14:01| And we'll talk about all that next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Well, I definitely want it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I've talked to Mr. Payone before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| But I definitely want it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| If it's a district race, only the people in the district can bring it forth and vote on, you know, recalling someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4451)|
| 1:14:20| I agree with that because we do not need people maybe not liking the way you vote on something up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| bringing up charges for you or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| It needs to be something that we've done illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| And if it's a district race, only the people in the district should be allowed to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| And we need to set these recall amendments probably, I guess, with some kind of election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| because we can't just go out here and have an election every time we turn around on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| It needs to be tied up with some kind of election, too, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Well, after a recall amendment, that would be placed on the ballot and the person is recalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| I mean, under our charter, we require primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| That's what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| It needs to be with something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| We can't just call a special election every time we turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| All of that is something to think about, and it becomes extremely time-consuming in order to, you know, have those elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| Well, we could word this to where the next regularly scheduled countywide election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| couldn't it be worded to where we would have the special election to coincide with the next election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I mean, like, for instance, if we had just had a, if someone had done a recall a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4532)|
| 1:15:42| a special election would be in February and then in, I guess, November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| as opposed to having to stop everything and put together a, you know, a whole new election at taxpayer expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| Couldn't we word this to where it just goes to the next election anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| You're going to have to address the requirements that are already in the charter one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| And I've just simply said that our charter requires a primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| and it lays it all out pretty specifically on what needs to be done if you're going to have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| And you couldn't do it like, take my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I've got half city and half county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| So in the elections they just had yesterday, those were city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Yeah, that could not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| You couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| You could tie it in, like John said, with just the primary county election, couldn't he, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| You had to have a primary and a general one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Under the charter as it exists now, unless we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| And this would basically give the citizens an option to challenge someone with recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| and put them in a recall election at the midterm election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| To challenge someone for any or no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Any or no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Any or no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Whether they've actually violated the law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Well, Mr. Paon is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Is it your intention of your group to recall every elected official that gets voted on in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| We want to leave it open to any elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Do you know that there's limitations to even what the voters in Knox County and who they could recall would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| even if the voters approved it overwhelmingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Which would those, which would are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Mr. Law Director, would they be judges or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| Through our charter, through our enabling legislation, we certainly know that we cannot affect judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| We cannot affect the judiciary, which the Supreme Court told us in the Jordan case that also means clerks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4660)|
| 1:17:48| clerks of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| And one of the things I've been looking at is whether it, which officials that it could apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| We know that through the Jordan litigation that you cannot term limit school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| But this appears to be a provision that you could recall school board members because there's no, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4688)|
| 1:18:19| the reason that you couldn't term limit school board members is there's a little state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| that said that they could succeed themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| And that's what the Supreme Court alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| And that's what they used as a basis for not allowing the county to term limit school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4710)|
| 1:18:38| I don't believe there is a statute that deals with school board members as far as protecting them from a recall provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| So they would be susceptible to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| It applies to Knox County elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Now, those are the elected officials that are covered by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| And it would not include the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| No, it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And, you know, the term limit provision, I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| They, the voters of Knox County wanted it to apply to state legislature, to the U.S. Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4750)|
| 1:19:21| and, you know, to everyone who was in an elected position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| We know that it cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| So there are limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| And I've just kind of expressed my opinion about a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| But it does look like that it could apply to school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| That's why we put in the, I believe it's section F, our severance clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| just to go ahead and make sure in case we ran into anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And we have that same provision in our charter as well as within the term limits provision of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4787)|
| 1:19:56| You know, somewhere down the way there will probably be a court review of all that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| This is my issue with the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| When the people voted on term limits in 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I think on the ballot it was something like all elected officials in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| And I think when people went out and voted, they thought it meant state senators, state reps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| anybody that was elected in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| And we find out that term limits really don't apply except to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| And I just want to make it clear to the people in Knox County, if they want a recall amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| it can apply to certain people and there's other people it cannot apply to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| no matter if every person in Knox County voted for it because there's limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| And I have some reservations about putting something on some people and not on other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4848)|
| 1:20:57| and certainly on people who are closest to the people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| I mean, you know, a lot of this stuff started in the legislature last year when a senator was caught taking bribes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4861)|
| 1:21:10| And we passed ethic reform and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| But even at that, if one of our senators or one of our reps took a bribe, we couldn't recall them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| I mean, they might go to jail, but we couldn't recall them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| They'd be under an ouster anyways, wouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| I'm still not used to speaking to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Wouldn't they be under an ouster provision anyways since what they did was criminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| They probably would, but so would us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| If a county commissioner got caught breaking the law, we would be probably on an ouster suit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| It's just provisions to get rid of people who do things wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| Well, criminal anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| There is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| I mean, take, for example, the Sunshine Law trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| What breaking the Sunshine Law wasn't criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| It was a civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| It was a civil trial and there were, well, I guess there were civil penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| But it's for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| And you realize the Sunshine Law applies to a quorum in probably more than 70 percent of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| It's 30 percent that it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| From what I understand, it doesn't apply that way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| And it doesn't apply to the state legislature either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| As a matter of fact, we'll be discussing that with Senator Birch at Monday on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Mr. Payne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| This Sunshine Law, how does that affect the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| How does it affect the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I can't say I'm quite clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Well, the reason why I said this, you know, this mayor of the city is a voting board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| He votes on things and he sends letters out all the time to the council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| He actually has lunch with just about every city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| And, you know, that, with him being a, he's not like our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Our mayor does not have a vote, so he can call us in and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| But it appears to me that the city council breaks it regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| When he's a voting member, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| As a matter of fact, I believe he just voted on a situation last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| But the city council, the city charter has their own recall provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| So if the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| But that doesn't have anything to do with the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| But if the voters find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| And this really doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| This charter amendment doesn't have anything to do with the Sunshine Law whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| Now, I think some of the members of Mr. Payne's organization, and there's several people in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| are ticked off about the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| But there's others that, you know, have no opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| In fact, there's folks that are within his organization that don't believe we did anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| I mean, it's a huge organization with a lot of folks that are interested in a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| And whatever the motivations are, I don't think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| It's a bad thing for citizens to have the opportunity to challenge any elected official that it could apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5041)|
| 1:24:12| with potential recall as long as there is a burden, there's a mountain to climb so that this can't be done on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5052)|
| 1:24:22| And as long as there's some provisions that keep us from having an election every month at a huge cost to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| I think it is a good thing for citizens to have this opportunity for a variety of reasons that Knox County has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5070)|
| 1:24:40| even experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| And I would like to point out that the city's provision has only been used once, and it was unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| So it's not like they're going to be using it every time it's Tuesday and the sky is blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| Well, in the ordinance, I would like for it, you know, when it comes to us to have who it would apply to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5091)|
| 1:25:04| because we know there's limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| The grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| The grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| I've got a meeting at the senior center at 3.30, which you know the mayor will be there and I have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| Actually, on that, we would prefer to leave it as is with the all elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| because we have left the severance provision in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| And we're well aware that the law can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| I mean, the Constitution was amended twice in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| So we would like to leave it in there so we won't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Well, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| And amend the provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| But I don't want to fool the voters in Knox County when they say all because I have gotten calls about term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| And they say, we went and voted and they pulled up the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And it says we voted for all elected officials in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| We want our senators, our congressmen, everybody to have two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Well, I'll certainly be doing my part to inform people of that, as I have been with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| I know, but I don't think you can inform 410,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Well, they didn't think I'd be standing here before you with an amendment so soon either, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| Well, as long as we're truthful and honest with the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I don't think if we put on the amendment who it would apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| So when they vote, then they would know for the sheriff, trustee, county commission, and whoever else it would apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5172)|
| 1:26:21| I mean, I don't think that's asking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| We would prefer to leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Well, I mean, then I would have to be opposed to your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| Well, we can, you can, Mr. Chairman, you know, he's bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| And then once we start working with this, we can tweak this however we see fit before we put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| So, I mean, if you, you know, I would encourage you to draw up your ideas as an amendment and present them at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5205)|
| 1:26:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| We'll see what you want to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Well, my proposal is nothing other than who it would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I mean, it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I think when you go out and vote for something, tell people the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| It's going to stand for the county commission, the county mayor, the sheriff, the trustee, the registrar of deeds, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| who it would apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| And that way I don't have to stand before people again and say, well, we voted for term limits in 1994, and it said all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| And these people run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| But if we're going to sit there and specify people what happens later on when the charter law changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| or the state law changes and these people lose that protection, and they are being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| and they can't be held subject to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Our charter amendment would specifically exclude them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| Well, you could probably put the ones that affect and then put at the end if something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| if the law changes that all officials would come under the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| We could put a clause as of now this would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Under current state law, this would affect and have the following offices that it would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| Well, I'll ask the law director here because I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| If we just left it as is and we left the severance clause in there, wouldn't that be the same effect anyways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| Oh, as far as who it applies to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, but?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| There's always a whole lot of gray and there's very little black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| If you don't, I mean, it was spelled out in the term limits provision, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| I mean, it talked about members of Congress and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| And it took a court case to basically tell us, well, it can't apply to all these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| Right now, that was a provision that was placed on the ballot by the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5318)|
| 1:28:55| I think it was unwise as far as who it applied to because we know that we can't affect members of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5335)|
| 1:29:03| Congress and the President of the United States and so on and so forth with our charter provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Who we can affect are persons that are covered by our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| The district attorney, we know we cannot affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| And we're not about to get the authority to affect the district attorney of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| That is strictly a state office and it's going to be from now until probably the end of my days and probably yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5363)|
| 1:29:34| So I certainly see the commissioner's point when he says, let's don't fool the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5374)|
| 1:29:43| Let's don't mislead the people of Knox County into thinking that this is going to apply it to every elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| that has set foot within Knox County or that is touched upon by a Knox County voter because that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| But what I'm going to bring to commission is what has been proposed by two commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| and that is Mark Harmon and Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| And I assume that is your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| So that's what's going to be before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| And if any of the commissioners wish to amend it, that's fine so long as they have the votes to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| It is going to be an ordinance and has to pass on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Mr. Payone, I have a question about why given your apparent success at bringing this before the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5432)|
| 1:30:42| or really I just want you to update us a little bit in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| how you don't really need the commission given where you are in your petitioning efforts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5446)|
| 1:30:56| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Well, I'm not one who likes to predict the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| but we do have a strong network and I like our chances if we were to go to a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| I just don't want to collect on two petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| I've never been through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| So if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| I actually have been through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And while I believe that Mr. Payone would have a shot at getting his petition signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| it is a tremendous amount of work for the volunteers involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| And I believe that the concept is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| And I believe that we need this kind of provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| And I don't think that we should force citizens to go out and spend the amount of time it takes to compile these signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| And trust me, I went through this with the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| I don't think we should force these citizens to go through this amount of work simply because we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| And I think that we need to support this and we need to put this on the ballot ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| Well, that may be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| And I may be in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| But I still wonder about Mr. Payone's process that if it's before the commission and he relies on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5526)|
| 1:32:15| we're almost taking some momentum away from his efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| In some way, I would think that Mr. Payone might see some of the success of his referendum tied to the ability to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5541)|
| 1:32:34| and petition and be successful in the petitioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| So I just wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| I mean, I'm just curious your view and your take on what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| And, you know, do you think you're successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| Do you think you will be successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Do you really want us to go ahead with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| In the process of taking it before the commission and before the law director, it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| it's not going to be as you think it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| I don't know, you know, because I'm brand new at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Well, let me see if I can answer that because I'm brand new at this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| Before, I don't know, before six months ago, my take on civics was to go out to research on the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| and the people who were running and vote, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| I never attended a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| I didn't even know where you guys met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| The reason I decided to take this route, and I talked this over with the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| and I have their blessing on this, is that after the Sunshine Law trial, and I won't lie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| this was a motivator for a large part of the group was the aftermath of the Sunshine Law trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| the aftermath of Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| We wanted to see if the government would be as good as it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| We wanted to see if you commissioners up there would back up what you were saying after the trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| of we want more open government, we want more accountability, we want the people's voice to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| This is your opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| We want you to sit here and not have us sit out there in the cold because it gets bloody cold out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| collecting those signatures, and we don't want to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| we don't want to collect these signatures any more than you want us out there collecting those signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| because if we're forced to go out there and do that, people are going to think it's us against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| I really think that you do want to collect those signatures because it's bloody cold to get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| And I really, I mean truly, Brian, when we're going to talk and have coffee and talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| I think that possibly the success of your effort may be tied indeed to the petitioning effort itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| And that's just a gut feeling about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| People want to be contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| People want to be solicited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| I never wanted to be solicited, to tell you that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| If Mr. Payone wants me to withdraw this, I'm, you know, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| And that's what I was going to say is, Tony, I mean, I can understand you going, and I got elected too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| and I knocked on a lot of doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| What we went through getting elected was nothing compared to what these citizens have to go through to collect this level of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5721)|
| 1:35:31| It is a tremendous, a tremendous amount of work for a lot of volunteers for something that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5731)|
| 1:35:41| I don't have anything to be afraid of from this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| I know there have been times that people may have been unhappy with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| that people may have disagreed with me on one thing or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| But for the most part, I believe that my district supports me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| And if I did not believe that my district supported me, I would not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| I would resign because I only want to be here as long as I have the blessing of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| And I think that something like this is extremely important in an era where term limits are being upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| Because a lame duck elected official, an elected official who does not have the ability to run again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| if there is no recall provision that can be used against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| they can do anything they want to do without any repercussions whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| I believe that we need to pass a common sense recall amendment and put it on the ballot for folks to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| I believe, like the chairman, that they probably need to know exactly to the letter what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| But I think that we need to pass this because I think at the end of the day this gives more power to the average citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| It gives them another check on our checks and balance system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| And I think at the end of the day it's going to be much better for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| Besides, in the end, I don't know if any of you gentlemen have read The Art of War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| It's one of my favorite books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| The Art of War?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| The Art of War, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| That's what I had heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| I actually prefer Musashi's Book of Five Rings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| It's a bit more in-depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| But The Art of War is a close second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| I certainly like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5844)|
| 1:37:24| But at any rate, Sun Tzu once said that no entity had ever benefited from a prolonged war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| It's not going to benefit my health any to go out there and collect signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| It's not going to benefit you guys any for making us go out there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| I would prefer to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| And a lot of the other group would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| There are some of the people who said, let's just go ahead to the petition drive and pass what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| But I've always believed in cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Brian, how did your group start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| I mean, who picked the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| The group kind of picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Is it from all over Knox County or is it from a community or neighborhood or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| We're pretty much from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| I think the only districts we don't have officially represented are 5th and 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| We have people working in the 5th and 9th, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| How did you all get together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| I built a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| I mean, adding a paper or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| I built a website and people showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| How did they get directed to the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Knox News Forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Blogging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5902)|
| 1:38:22| How many of you own the blogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Only two of us in Knoxville, and my wife doesn't care about politics, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Over the past several months, we have now, you know, copied off some blogs from a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| And, you know, we want people to help us solve problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| But I think some of the comments that's been made are a little more hateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| You know, saying people is crooked, corrupt, should be put in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| I mean, I don't think that's a way that we solve our problems by going out and name calling people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| So, I mean, that's my personal opinion on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| we need people who want to get serious and help solve problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Of course, Internet Forum is an Internet Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| Yeah, and I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| I mean, regardless of how we feel about some of Mr. Pound's other views, I think he's brought a good idea to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5958)|
| 1:39:26| And I think that we need to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| I think it needs a tiny bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| I don't think this should be able to be used just on a whim, but I believe it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| And I believe that, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I have said things on blogs that are not my opinions now, but at the time, as an e-jerk reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| I got hot under the collar and I've said stuff in this meeting when I had a knee-jerk reaction that I apologized for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5986)|
| 1:39:55| And that's exactly why we have to be careful when we do things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| They're not knee-jerk reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| They make common sense and they're for the betterment of a community down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| And I think that this, that a recall amendment will be better for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| And I believe that we need all the commissioners to have input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| I mean, that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| It comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Amendments can be offered, accepted or rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| And at the end of the day, you know, I think we're going to wind up with something that's going to be really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| and really positive for Knox County and add just a little more accountability to elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| And I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| And, Brian, thanks for taking time out of your day to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| And I appreciate the work you're doing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| I thought my boss feels the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I think I'm a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Do you want us to write you a note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| We can write you a note, like a doctor's note or a dentist's note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| I might go with my boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| He seems to like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| He likes you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| His boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| His boss is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| Mr. Chair, would it be required reading that we read either one of those two books before we can vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I'll be happy to loan you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| It will actually help in your campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| I'm sure you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| Just for the record, he's talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| I have a little girl calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| She just got home from school, and she's called about 14 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Going to item number 38, consideration of resolution, Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| blank commission approval of any hybrid employee, independent contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| or other failing to meet a 30-hour work week requirement and seeking any Knox County benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| It's sponsored by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6109)|

| 1:42:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Go back 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Consideration of resolution, Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| approving a contract with blank to provide an on-site wellness center for eligible Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| I've got a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| In concept, I believe in this type of center, but this type of center is only going to work if it has employee participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6133)|
| 1:42:23| And based on the telephone calls and conversations I'm having with employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| it is not in my opinion at this time at least that the employees will participate in this significantly enough to save any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Okay, 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| We've already read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Commissioner Ballard, do you have any comments about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| The only comments that I have on this, it's a little bit unusual, is that I'm looking at it as liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6164)|
| 1:42:53| and also it's a tremendous loss for taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| And it's something that needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I thought we already had a provision for 30-hour work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| We do, if you're an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| But if you're an independent contractor or some designation by a department head or some other official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6190)|
| 1:43:21| then there have been several that have received benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6201)|
| 1:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| If there's one person who wants to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| A 39 consideration resolution of the Knox County Commission to approve an audit by Richard Wiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| in regards to the health benefits, premiums paid and payable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| or pass due for Knox County contract tax attorney from either the attorney or the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| This sort of goes hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Whenever we pass the budget, and it was my first budget, and it came up, and it sort of goes 38 and 39 goes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| I never dreamed that an independent contractor would be designated as an employee of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| even though there was a letter in 1998 by Richard Beeler suggesting it was an advisement letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| But the responsibility of hiring and designating at that time fell to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| And when we talked about the health benefits for our tax attorney, I assumed he was paying the full premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6264)|
| 1:44:34| Somehow that has got, and I've talked to John Troyer, I've talked to our HR guy, Richard Wiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6274)|
| 1:44:45| and they're in total disagreement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| But Brian on the day of the budget hearing heard that and that we had an independent contractor receiving benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6287)|
| 1:44:58| and he sort of has said that that didn't meet the 202 guidelines of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6298)|
| 1:45:07| and has sought to terminate that type of relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| But when you think of that, in the opinion that was rendered, it is my thought that any independent contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6314)|
| 1:45:23| rural metro, Cherokee health, janitor out here that's an independent contractor, I don't see how that you cut those off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6323)|
| 1:45:35| And let's just say that any of those, you get into a situation like liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| I think that if they were driving in some fashion to a job and hit a busload of kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6340)|
| 1:45:48| Knox County could be brought into that on a liability situation if they did anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6348)|
| 1:45:57| And you sort of get into vicarious liability, you know, I mean, I think in terms of the family doctrine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6357)|
| 1:46:06| Anyway, you can be sued and that would be an element that we would have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| That would be expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| The other thing about it is an independent contractor is a 1099.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| He's subject to a contract and we can't fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| There's nothing that I can see in IRS normal accounting guidelines that says the independent contractor should be eligible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6381)|
| 1:46:31| benefits of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And the benefits that we pay, if I was an employee here, I would be really mad because they're taxed against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| as in health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| The second part that you read there is the reason that I brought that up in trying to track some documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| I've been stonewalled a little bit by the trustee's office, but I have been furnished documents by the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| and they're literally thousands of dollars of unaccounted for premium that has not been paid or can be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6416)|
| 1:47:06| And we're literally talking thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| And it dates back for at least six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| And I'm not going to say it and I don't think any of us are going to take the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| And we need somebody like our auditor to see where those missing records are because if that has been unpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6442)|
| 1:47:31| I'm willing to ask that it be paid back by the beneficiary of the or the recipient of the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6451)|
| 1:47:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| 40 and 41 is closure of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| Item 42 is an ordinance of Knox County Commission amending the Knox County Personnel Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| to establish a health insurance appeal board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| And human resource is bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Is human resource here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| 43 is an ordinance of Knox County Commission, Tennessee, rescinding the approval of Ordinance 78101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| and approving the stormwater ordinance as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| And it's sponsored by Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| John, is there or are there any changes since the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| And we'll get those changes, I assume, in our packet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Right now what is in the packet is the ordinance as it was passed on second reading last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| Bruce, as you've read, I'm sure, has been discussing the stormwater ordinance that we have in place with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6522)|
| 1:48:54| through the city's concerns that they have made no bones about and trying to come to some agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6534)|
| 1:49:05| And I believe that they have reached an agreement on most every item, perhaps with the exception of the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6545)|
| 1:49:19| And so it's being brought back to commission to change a number of provisions that may not matter in the long haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6559)|
| 1:49:33| and that Bruce has reached agreement with the city on and then for a further discussion about the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| So from my interpretation of what took place between the engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| it was there were a lot of semantic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| And this is six in one and a half dozen of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| And they've been able to reach agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| So we'll have those in the document for the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| And I assume they'll give us some kind of summary statement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| But what about the pipe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| What if the pipe is still an issue to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| What are we to do with the pipe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| Whatever it is this body desires, whatever six members of this body desires to do with the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| I think there's going to be certainly further discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| I know discussions with the city, I believe, are ongoing about the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| But there are other recommendations, I believe, that will be coming to this commission on amending that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6633)|
| 1:50:41| But what it also does is, I mean, we already have a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| What it will also do is narrow the scope of that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| It will get rid of all of these tangential issues and basically get down to pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6652)|
| 1:51:01| if they wish to proceed with the pipe issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| I think Bruce has, from what I understand, some very good recommendations to make regarding pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| And maybe the city ought to revisit their ordinance to allow for pipe that wasn't even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6672)|
| 1:51:28| wasn't even invented whenever the city's ordinance was passed in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| I think we've, the pipe industry has made certain strides toward other materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| and the city's ordinance doesn't consider it and maybe they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| So it's further discussion and I know discussions with the city are ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| and hopefully we'll be able to work out all of our issues with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| And so they won't feel the necessity of proceeding with a lawsuit against Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| We can spend our time doing other more useful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Item 44 is an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee repealing Knox County Code 62-333C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6732)|
| 1:52:21| Whenever a usable path for bicycle has been provided adjacent to a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| bicycle riders shall use such path and shall not use the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| And it's on there by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| Item 45 is consideration of acceptance of new county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| And item 46 is a discussion regarding the appointments of 12 offices vacated as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| of Chancellor Fantner's ruling and Open Meetings Act lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| Any questions, comments on that from the commission or any audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| Okay, 47 is line item transfer, 48 change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| And then we have our zoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| Anything else we need to add to the agenda or withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| I've just got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| You said you would accept questions from members of the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| This is under zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| 9C07SP and 9E07RZ, Alex Schubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| That's a fourth district rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Traditionally, we have looked to the members of the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| but I have no one to talk to about that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Will I have one before the November meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| Will you have what, a district representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| A fourth district representative to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Not by the 19th, because even if we said on the 13th we're going to appoint ten days, that would be the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| But you have commissioners from other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Well, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| And I don't think I have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| We had some initially, but we've worked out some agreements and conditions on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6847)|
| 1:54:15| I'll talk to the other people involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| Maybe we can just jointly submit a request for approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| And I'll, of course, send you all the agreements we've reached beforehand then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| You've answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071107?start=6870)|
