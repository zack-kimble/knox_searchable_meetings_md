| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to call this meeting to order. Mr. Watson is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| able to be with us today. I think everybody else is here so thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| being here. I don't think we have announcements at the moment. Anybody have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| any anything they need to announce? All right so we'll just jump right in. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| have two things on our agenda today. We're going to discuss our budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| we're also going to discuss school capacity, how those determinations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| made. So we will just jump right in. Mr. McPherson, are you going to take it away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| for us? Thank you Madam Chair. Actually Joe Snyder, our budget director, and Joni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| Joyce, our budget analyst, will be handling this presentation. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| really the brains and the brawn behind this and and I've said this before. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| have tried to do that job before and they took it to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| higher level. So they do a fantastic job and we're really fortunate to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| them. So I'm going to turn it over to them. They really do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| fantastic job and I'll just brag on them for a moment. I believe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| was at our work session last September and some of you may have seen this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| know the board members have, but they presented us with how close they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| are in their estimates over time on our budget and they were within what one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| a half percentage points for the last several years. So I think that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| quite right. They do a fantastic job of what to us appears like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| guessing game, figuring out what kind of money we're going to have going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| forward. But to them, it's amazing that they come within that close. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| you for your hard work and thank you for being here. Yeah and thank you for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| comments. And Ron does play a big role in this despite his argument there. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| I want to say this again. I do want to say this too about that presentation. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| think I said this the last time we met. So yes, we've been fortunate to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| very close on actuals to budgeted, but a lot of that goes to our departments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| the heads of those departments and that's implementing their budgets with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| fidelity. So and I think I said this last time, we didn't show that to pat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| ourselves on the back. It's more about bragging on the district itself. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| is a number we're proud of. So anyway, without saying anything else about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| we'll go ahead and jump into the presentation. I apologize to board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| members on the committee. This is going to be a rerun of our community budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| meeting. I told Ron yesterday, I'm tired of hearing myself talk, so I can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| you guys are tired of hearing it as well. I'll just give you a kind of an idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| budget in comparison to two things. Historically, the last few years and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| to our peers across the state. A couple of data points on that. And then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| going to look at our projected revenues that are in the board approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| And then look at a couple different, we've sliced the expenditures a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| different ways. One is kind of a high-level, all-encompassing salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| benefit enhancements that are in this budget. And then Joni is going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| about some of the departmental level initiatives that are a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| budget. And we'll leave some time for questions at the end. And I'll say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| as well, if you have any questions along the way about something I'll say, feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| free to stop me. So this is the slide I'm talking about concerning an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| overview of the budget. Just want to point out, just if you look at the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| the graph there, the couple of the ones that jump off the page at you are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| fiscal year 23 and the current fiscal year in terms of how much larger they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| are than the last two historically, the 20 and 21. And if you're familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| our budget and most of you are, typical year-to-year growth is about three to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| four percent. In the last couple of years we've realized a larger growth than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| 7.6 in 22, which is the current year. And then projecting about a nine percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| growth between now and next year. And I'll say a couple things about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| how does this compare to our districts across the state that are our peers. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| we, when we say that they're really six districts that we are a part of, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| would be just kind of working ourselves across the state from east to west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Hamilton, Metro, Nashville, Williamson, Rutherford, and Shelby. When you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| our budget, I'm comparing current year's budget not projected fiscal year 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| because I haven't seen all of their numbers just yet. But amongst those six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| we're the third largest in terms of budgets and general purpose. Also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| third largest in terms of the number of students that we have. Both Metro and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| believe Shelby County's budgets for the current fiscal year are over a billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| dollars. And so we're at 542 for the current year, so we're significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| behind them. And behind us Hamilton, Rutherford, and Williamson all fall into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| the same, you know, within a hundred million or so of where we are there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| just to provide some some context. Any questions on that one before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| So the next few slides we look at the revenues that are in the projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| budget. And so state revenue, and that's of course for the current year and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| next year, is going to be through the BEP. And our typical year-over-year growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| there has been about four percent for the last decade. And this number's in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| because we're projecting, and we actually got our April estimate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| week, and so two percent growth is about what we're going to see between now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| next year. And really, and you're familiar this as well, but the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| that drive this growth are two things. One is how much new money the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| puts into the BEP each year. And then secondly the number of students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| each district has. And I circled that because you'll see there at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| we have seen a bit of a dip in our ADM. If you look back at fiscal year 21, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| our funding for fiscal year 21 was based on 59,000 and almost 600 students. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| compare that to our funding for the current year, our number there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| 57,384 students. So about 2,000 or so students less. That's the first year in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| the last several that we saw a dip in the number of students that we have. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| you look at the next, the fiscal year 23 number, it has picked back up about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| thousand, which is about 1.7 percent or so. So hopefully that progression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| continues because that is an important factor the state uses in allocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| funds. Before I forget about the state portion, it's the single largest portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| of our funding at the district level. It's about 45 percent of our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| fiscal year of funding. The next largest portion, and if you add both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| together, it comprises about 53 percent of our funding. And that's our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| option sales taxes as well as our current property tax. The current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| or the typical year-over-year growth is about 4 percent for sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| And you'll see the 25 percent number which jumps off the page at you. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| said this in all the meetings we've done, this is a bit misleading. That doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| represent 25 percent growth in our sales tax collections. That's just a budget to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| budget number. And so a lot of that was impacted. You go back a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| ago to the COVID year, we ended up under budgeting how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| sales tax we thought we would collect that fiscal year, just based on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| economists across the state and nation were saying at that time. And so really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| since then, we have seen strong growth in sales tax collections, but a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| significant year-to-year change you see here is due to us under budgeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| one year and kind of playing catch-up. Can I ask on the fiscal year 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| projected change for property tax, I notice we've gone from 1 percent to 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| percent. And new builds, I mean, we're expecting enough new builds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| that'll increase that percentage by a percent, we think? Yeah, so and Ron, feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| free to jump in if you have some thoughts on this as well. So what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| typically do there is meet with Chris Caldwell and his team, and we analyze both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| of these categories. What does current year look like in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| the trends? And so I believe that 2 percent number, I think it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| projection. We anticipate what's been happening to continue to happen, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| has been mainly due to, they're going to collect more this year than what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| budgeted, and it's mainly due to new builds and the growth we see. And I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| property tax, I'm assuming, is more reliable number than sales tax. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| we're just at the whim of what people spend. I mean, is that kind of correct? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| mean, property tax, we really can pretty much predict what we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| collecting. It is. And then sales tax, we just have to wait and see. Yeah, so it's good. In good years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| when sales tax is really good, I mean, the district really benefits from that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| think you see an offsetting, the alternative side of that's what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| county is seeing. Their budget is more dependent upon property taxes, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| not as dynamic as sales tax. So during strong sales tax growth, it's great for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| the district, but we've also seen years where it's not been great, and so during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| those times are a little tougher. But yes, to your point, property taxes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| much more stable. Any other thoughts or questions on that? I mean, I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| point out the property tax, but we just discussed that, and that's really all I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| going to touch on that. I'd like to go back to the previous slide. I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| way too early, this new formula that's come out. Have you checked into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Because this $591 million, we're going to have to match that in coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Right. And if this formula that we get punished in Knox County, you know, I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| to say that three-letter word, but something will have to happen. Yes, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| a good point. I actually, I thought of mine was to touch on TISA a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and so I'll give my few thoughts, and Ron, you may want to jump in here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| What we see in the next couple of years, the numbers the state has provided, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| see pretty significant growth just in state funds alone for fiscal year 24, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| we're thinking maybe anywhere between 20 and 30 percent growth over what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| currently have. So compare that to what we historically have seen, 4 percent. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| 20 to 30 percent growth is going to be significant money for the district. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| to your point, that along with that comes maintenance of effort on the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| level. I think when you look at the out years past fiscal year 24, so 25 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| about 29, I think that was the years they provided to us. The year-to-year growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| they show in state funds after next year are going to be one and a half to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| percent, and it's on a gradual decrease, which I do think will increase the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| burden at that point. Ron, if you want to add anything to that. No, thanks, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| Yeah, Joe's right. When we take a look at that, initially the dollars from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| TISA would appear to be very significant. The concern we have is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| sustainability of it. So there is the local maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| requirement. I think, based on what I've seen, I think we're good there, and when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| say we're good, I think the county's good. Because on the local requirement, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| already significantly, the county contributes significantly more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| what is actually required through the BEP formula. So even though the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| amount of dollars would increase and the local requirement would increase, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| we're probably at a safe place to where there wouldn't be necessarily a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| burden by statutory burden, if I want to call it that, on the county. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| concern we have is, aside from that, is the increase in dollars would do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| appear to be even enough to cover inflationary growth. So I think that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| those dollars would come, I think we have to be extremely strategic in how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| spend and budget those dollars for the reasons you mentioned. Because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| yeah, I think we're good from a, I guess, from a law standpoint, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| we're going to be fine. The issue is going to be, though, with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| strategic budgeting, such that we don't over commit when the sustainability may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| not be there. So we're going to have to tackle that for probably next budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| year. So we're already looking at some of those dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Any other thoughts or questions on TISA or BEP? Okay, so the third major category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=807)|
| 0:13:41| of revenue that we have on our revenue overview for the budget is related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| federal programs. It also has more interdepartmental slash governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| type of transfers. So a couple items here I want to point out that changed in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| section. The federal programs, the district is allowed to charge indirect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| cost to any grant that's funded by the federal government. This 1.5 million was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| simply a reinstatement of what we charge the school nutrition fund to manage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| grant each year. At the beginning of this current fiscal year, their reserve funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| were not enough that we could charge that. And so we're just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| reinstating that amount. Then the local grant, that's made up of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| different local initiatives that the mayor's office provides. One is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| kindergarten intervention grant, which is a little bit over a million, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| literacy initiative grant. That funding is reduced, but those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| that we have in our expenditure budget are still in the general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| and will continue. And that goes back to what we were talking earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| property taxes. Just by virtue of their budget being more reliant on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| property tax, they're not seeing the large growth we are. So they asked if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| could suspend that revenue item for the coming year and we'll reevaluate that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| fiscal year 24. But no services or positions are being reduced as reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| of that grant. Are they just reducing that grant or we're doing away with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| grant for next year? So I leave it, I say suspending it for now. I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| room for us to, we always have that conversation with the mayor and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Chris each year. And Ron, you may know different, I haven't heard them say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| is this is done for good. And are there any other line items, because I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| know, I mean my understanding has been the reason we do it as grants is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| it's not seen as maintenance of effort, continuing it and can be looked at year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| to year. Are there any others besides these two that are considered grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| from the county? Those are the only two. Okay. Elevate or is that? Sorry, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Yes, the Elevate grant, which is our high school for students that, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=946)|
| 0:15:56| the right word I'm looking for? Yes, drug recovery. Thank you. So there's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| $90,000 of a grant that was started for the current fiscal year that is still in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| next year's budget. And one thing if I could interject too, you know, so you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| this, the mayor, this administration has been absolutely fantastic as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| being an education supporter. So I know the mayor is completely in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| these, of these initiatives. Something like this is not necessarily unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Like we have, we have gone to the county before and asked for some relief on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| certain things through the years, right? And so when when their reserves can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| maybe help us out, or we can, you know, through the budget process we can kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| we have a really good relationship with the county. And so this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| necessarily unusual. It's, I mean, the mayor is extremely supportive of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| do. So, but we recognize that, you know, as the point's been made, property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| while they are more stable than sales tax, they don't provide the growth in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| good year like sales tax does. And so what we're very conscious of is that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| you know, there may be a time when the economy's going not so well, right? And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| then the county may step in and kind of help us through certain times like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| So I just want to make that point too, that we just have a really good working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| relationship. I think it's really healthy that both bodies can, you know, do, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| work together to make sure that, you know, we do what's right with with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| students and the citizens of Knox County. So, you know, I just wanted to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| kind of put that in there. Thank you. So when you add up the pluses and minuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| we talked about there, it's about a forty nine and a half million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| increase, which is back to what we showed over there, about nine percent over our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| current year budgeted revenues. So I want to pivot now and look at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| expenditures in the budget. The next couple of slides, we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| compensation benefit type enhancements as well as additional positions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| in this budget. Before I get into the line by line here, I do want to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| the budget survey we did this year as well as the strategic plan. If you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| at the top, you know, those are the items that we use every year to help build the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| budget. But you'll see as we talk through some of these, it ties directly back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| especially to the strategic plan and also the survey we did. The highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| responses we got on the survey this year from the community, there were about 4,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| responses, was they value hiring and retaining quality teachers and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| paying our teachers well. And then the third thing beneath those two was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| classroom sizes. They want to maintain our current classroom sizes where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| possible. So I think you'll see as we talk through some of these items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| touch all three of those. So the first one you see is just a salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| step increase for eligible personnel and that means anyone who's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| currently topped out on the schedule gets a step increase. Depending on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| schedule and where they are on it, that can be anywhere from one to almost two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| percent increase year-to-year and that is a part of this recommended budget. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| second item there is a four percent increase base salary, base salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| schedule increase for all certified and classified salary schedules. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| you'll see the third item, this is the second year in a row that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| superintendent board have had made what I call a targeted approach to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| specific salary schedules which are our educational assistance, school clerical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| and our custodial positions. And those, if you think about those two things we come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| to mind, one is they're typical on our lower end of the wage scale so they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| some attention. So that's why we've done eight percent for two years in a row. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| in the second part of that too is just vacancies. The last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| we've ran probably 70 to 80 vacancies custodial year-round and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| same with educational assistance. So there are positions that are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| budget but we just can't fill them because we can't find people to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| those jobs. And to that point, I think, can you talk, one of you talk about we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| going to do the salary schedule? Yes, thank you. Yeah, and so it's a good point. So we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| have in the budget $300,000 slotted for a consultant, someone outside to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| and look at our salary schedules in totality and give us a recommendation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| how to address the issues we're talking about and try to provide a path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| on how to manage the salary schedules and targeting these areas where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| a hard time finding employees. And I'll just say one of the issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| I brought up during my budget meeting that would also be addressed in that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| we have a lot of teachers or staff members who've been in with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| district for more than 20 years and they get to the top of that salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| and then they, you know, there's nowhere to go. So that would also be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| this review because we've tossed around in the past couple of years that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| so that would be addressed in this as well, which I think is important to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Yeah, and we've looked at that a couple times in the past and going back, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| think Ron, you were doing this job at the time, but I think we thought then was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| how to get people to the top quicker so they collapse the five steps down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| step 20. But now we do hear a lot of what Ms. Horne's saying, which is folks who top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| out at step 20. I think in our teacher category, I think we have about 20% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| our teacher base is at step 20 and above. Yeah, so I think, you know, just I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| they're feeling like they're being penalized and we certainly need, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| now more than ever, we need those mature teachers. So we, you know, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| definitely a concern just so that you guys know that that I brought up and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| know other board members have as well. Well, and I really support doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| too because I feel like we anecdotally talk about all the time, like our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| surrounding counties, and we need to base it on factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and be able to have a report that I think truly can tell us, and even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| can't get there right away, it's something that we can sort of aspire to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| and start working for and actually have tangible numbers and stuff like that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| I agree on the, because what I have a problem with right now in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| schools is we're almost encouraging our really good, experienced teachers to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| out of the classroom and go into central office and things like that because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| only way they can increase their salary is to get out of the classroom, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| really don't, I mean, we want people who want to aspire to do that to do that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| if it's only for money, you know, we're losing some great people over salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| and, you know, right now we don't need to lose our good teachers. Yeah, I agree. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| think we see that end of it. They need to make more money, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| therefore they aspire to be something outside the classroom, which does hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| the students, and then we also, historically, have been a training ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| for surrounding districts. You know, that's another way to make more money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Knox County doesn't pay as well as Maryville or some other districts, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| I'll spend a couple years here, get some experience, and then jump to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| higher-paying job there. So both of those need addressing. So jumping down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| student transportation, so anytime we do a base salary schedule increase, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| try to add money to the bus contractor pay, and just for those of you who aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| aware of that, we don't hire our own bus drivers, so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| have our own school buses right now. We contract that out, so our way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| trying to ensure that bus drivers receive additional pay is to put more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| money into the bus contracts, and I think that contract we increased by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| about 1.6 million dollars for fiscal year 23. And then the health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| contributions, we anticipate the state's, we're on the state's health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| plan, we anticipate that increasing by about 6% for next year, so when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| price that out, it's going to cost the district about 3 million dollars to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| maintain our current level that we cover for each employee, and I think on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| it's about 72% of each employee's health insurance the district covers, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| on plan selection there. And then the last one we talked about at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| budget voting meeting was the extension of TCRS, which is state retirement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| those classified employees. Historically, we've had any classified employee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| been on our county's local retirement plan, which is what they call a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| contribution, which means it's defined how much you're going to contribute out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| of your paycheck each month or each every couple of weeks, whereas the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| state's has been more of a traditional pension type plan. So Mr. Thomas talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| about at the meeting about how this has been a goal of his for a long time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| get classified employees on this plan as well, and the board agreed with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| And so just to kind of put it into perspective, we see it as a small cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| the district, but a big gain for our employees. It's for the current, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| next year budget, we're anticipating a little bit over a hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| dollars of an impact to the budget, which is not insignificant, but when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| compare it to five hundred and ninety million, it is. And then you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| what's going to happen for those employees. So if I'm hired as a TA next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| year, it can help, it can help recruit TAs to the classroom, because if they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| start as an educational assistant, they will already be on the TCRS retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| plan. And so let's say after a couple of years as a TA, you decide to become a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| teacher, put the work in to become a certified teacher, you maintain your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| years of service and contributions in that same retirement plan. That's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| case currently, so they would have to change retirement plans. So see that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| win-win for the district. Is there any discussion, especially in this 8% base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| salary schedule increase, for increasing salaries or payment for substitutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| Because I know we were hurting significantly for them as well. That has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| been part of the conversation, and I don't have the scale right in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| me. And if you all are aware of our subschedule, it is quite a range of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| depending on which day of the week you work, whether it be a Monday or Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and which building you're working at, you can make decent money being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| substitute. And I say that because a couple years ago, or a few years ago, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| changed to this plan, what we realized immediately was we lost a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| educational assistants because they can make more money being a substitute. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| the other thing that they didn't receive benefits, of course. But back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| your point, that's not part of this projected budget. I think our hope is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| that as part of that salary schedule study we're doing, we hope to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| analysis on that. But one thing that is part of the budget is adding a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| substitute to each school. So that's part of the budget. And then secondly, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| according to Scott Bolton, we have more substitutes now than we did prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1611)|

| 0:27:02| leave, like deciding on a Thursday to take Friday off, so there's not a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| notice, which is creating gaps in the classroom. So it's kind of, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| I'm told, is you know there's a couple of things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| Any other questions on the compensation or benefit enhancements? So back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| I said earlier, those tie directly back to our strategic plan in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| creating a positive culture. I think most employees would be happy with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| 4% and the 8% and maintaining health insurance contributions, along with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| other items. And it also, I think, goes directly to the salary, the survey, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| you know, one way to show teachers that you appreciate them is to maintain 4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| or, you know, where possible, more salary schedule increase. The thing I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| touch on here, just thinking about inflation, and we all know that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| issue right now. We were asked in an earlier meeting, are you concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| inflation? And there are some items in the budget that are directly tied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| inflation. Gas prices, building materials, things of that nature. But that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| concern going forward for salary schedule increases as well. And if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| look back at the last 10 years of salary schedule increases the district has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| able to put in place, the three of the last four years, the 4% is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| time we've done that as a district. Historically, and you all have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| around, know that usually 3% is kind of the max you get. In some years it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| that, and in a lot of years the certified would get 3%, classified 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So that is stabilized, and that's a good thing. We're meeting that MOU that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| have. But the problem is, if inflation is above 7% and you're giving a 4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| raise, you're still going to get pushback from your employee base because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| they're losing money in that equation. So something for us to keep an eye on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| While I'm out and about, I get questions and they'll, once they see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| $591.5 million, they're going to say that's a lot of money. It is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| money, but a lot of that money is going towards compensation. Do you know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| that number is? When I say, yeah, but that $591 million, $400 and some odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| million is going for benefits and compensation. Do you know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| number is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I'll tell you the percent of, if you're talking about the total $591.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| million, 83% of that number, and I don't have that number off the top of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| head, but 83% of that number goes directly to salary and benefit. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| significant, significant number. We typically say, you know, most of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| expenses are in people because we are in the people business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1786)|

| 0:29:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Joe, you and Ron probably know I'm the type of guy that lays in bed at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| and watches economic news and financial channels. A 9% growth in budget with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| budget that derives a lot of its revenue from sales tax, which is a consumer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| driven instrument. How much, I know in the past we've always been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| conservative in how we approach this, but this is a large increase in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| turbulent time. How much confidence do you have that projections will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| to meet numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So I'll give you my few thoughts on it and Ron chime in here where you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| So it's a good question. It goes back to that 25% number I showed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| sales tax growth budget to budget. So in looking at that, and I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| through April's collections sales tax for this current year. Chris Simons does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| both a five year trend analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Chris is really good too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| He is. And an eight year trend analysis. And so we take the average of those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| and then meet with Caldwell and his team and just to give it a sniff test, so to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| speak, to make sure we're going down the right path there. When you look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| current year collections through April, we're trending to collect about 216| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| million in sales taxes for the current fiscal year. And so if you take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| number and look at what's in the budget for sales tax collections for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| it's about 220. So the growth there, if you look, if you take out the COVID year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| and look at the year to year actual collections prior to COVID, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| looking at three to 4% growth. So we feel like we're still pretty, pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| conservative based on what our actual collection is going to be this year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| what we budgeted next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| No, thanks, Joe. I'll chime in on that, too. And also, I think we're trending a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| little higher on property tax, too. If you look at the total, like just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| total amount, so what we're projecting in total revenue this year, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| there's some months left, so this is a projection, where we think we'll land in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| total revenue. If you factor all of these things together, it's more, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| it's probably about a 2% increase. I'm going to use the word projected actual if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| there is such a thing. Projected actual 22 versus budget 23, it's probably 2% or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| less. So we think it's still a pretty conservative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| That's a good question. I guess the thing I'm concerned about is we use a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| trends and models, and we're in territory that's not trended and modeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| True. Yeah, that's a good point. And so I think our work on that side, in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| to what Ron said earlier about TISA and trying to make sure we build capacity in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| the budget in terms of anticipating that large state growth and the out years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| that, is also paying attention to this sales tax number. We're all cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| about that because we know how things work. And to your point, no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| no matter what the actual year looks like, that may drop off the face of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| earth next month. We may be back at the drawing board. With that being said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| think we'd have to go back a few years to find a budget where the, and I hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| say this because I made jinxes here, but I don't think, I think you'd be hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| pressed to find a year where we budgeted a sales tax number that wasn't surpassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| in actual collections. I think we're all, we always try to be on the conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| side because we're all nervous about that number. I just know this year with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| our budget has been a bit of a struggle because our revenue streams are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| different than yours. Yeah, true. It's a good point. Carson, that number with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| including taxes, employee taxes and benefits, is $492.7 million. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| 83.2 percent of our budget. That's what this says. And then, and if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2029)|
| 0:34:04| like areas of utilization, they give us all these cool little charts, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| really like. If you combine student instruction, school management and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| support, student support services, instructional staff support and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| curricular and student body support, that's 74 percent of the budget. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| doesn't include district office employees, which a lot of them are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| out, you know, in the schools, but it doesn't include them. Yeah, so, yeah, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| facilities is only, you know, less than 11 percent of the budget. It's labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| intensive. So people that, and I remember, you know, people that want to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| the budget, it's like, well, then you have to cut employees because there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| that's, that's what we have. We're very, you know, people intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| business. So that's where the, that's where the money is. Joe, I don't know if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| wanted to, if you're through with this part of the presentation on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| revenue and expense side of it, if you wanted to perhaps get into the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| budget, that might be a good segue into our next item. So I have a couple more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| slides, so let me finish those, and then Russ is actually the expert on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| capital budget, so and that segues, because I think he's doing the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| presentation as well. So the rest of this slide, I'll say this ties back to, in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| minds, to the classroom size equation we talked about, which the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| also indicated they value. This slide represents positions that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| added in this budget. There's really three main categories of that. Every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| once school starts, we always end up adding what we call unanticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| positions, no matter how much we try to anticipate and budget for those. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2146)|

| 0:36:00| we, to carry those over into the next fiscal year, of course, has a cost with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| it. So that's the first item you see there. We did see a significant cost tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| to the second one here, which was, remember, last year we started the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2168)|

| 0:36:15| Initially, we were able to cover all that with ESSER funds, but once the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| made those official schools and just assigned a school code to those, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| required, as part of the general purpose budget, to staff those the same way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| would a brick-and-mortar building. So because of that, we had to absorb several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| of those positions into the general purpose budget, and those are part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| continuing budget for next year. And the last one is where we talk, and we talk, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| think, with the committee about this in the past, our staffing allocation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| in the spring. So as a result of the projected enrollment growth across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| district at several schools, we add teachers, school administrators, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| counselors. And so if you total those three items up, you're looking at about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| 8.75 million on top of the prior slide. So we add just the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| additions we make and the salary benefit enhancements. It's about a 34| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| million dollar total investment of the 49 and a half that we have as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| part of this budget, or about 70 percent if you put it into a percent. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| Joni's going to talk about the departmental level slides for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2245)|

| 0:37:41| So thank you. I'm going to talk to you about the next couple of slides. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| can go quickly if you want to also talk about capital. So this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| kind of encompasses our process that we go through every year when we start our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| budget build, is we actually meet with all of the departments that have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| account in our general purpose budget. We review their staffing with them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| their below-the-line items, which are like their materials, their software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| things like that. And we compile all their additional requests, and we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| that before the superintendent and his team, as well as the Board of Ed, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| that kind of becomes part of our budget proposal. So this one is six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| million dollars, and it's basically the top bullet is our special ed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| student support area. So we'll be adding 42 new positions in that, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| includes special ed instruction, as well as support. Our welcome center for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| community, there's a significant investment in that for more interpreters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| and services to help with the students and families that are non or limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| English-speaking. You hear us every year talk about how we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| add nursing positions for medically fragile students. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| part is, there's some expansion in there, like for pre-k, special ed pre-k| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| programs, as well as enhancing programs that are already existing. And then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| can see in the, excuse me, in the parenthesis, every time we give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| fairly large increase to our educational assistance, we also have to absorb some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| positions from federal funds into that, because the federal funds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| limited, and so the salaries become larger for their budget, and then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| to absorb some positions. So that's the first bullet. The second bullet I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| refer to more as the area that deals with our social and emotional health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| our students. So we're adding 18 new positions, eight social workers, primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2368)|

| 0:39:43| to add additional staff in those areas every year, so that we can lower our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| ratio between those positions and the students that they serve to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| better services for them. And then in school culture, we're adding three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| system-wide positions that will focus in on the whole child, and be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2398)|

| 0:40:25| education. And then the next bullet is, we're making a significant investment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| the music and performing arts area by reinstating a supervisor for the music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2430)|

| 0:40:39| the fine arts program, so that that area will have its own specialist to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2439)|

| 0:41:16| established in the community. And then halfway through the year, we'll hire the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| assistant principal so that they can start building their staff. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| bottom level kind of takes into account all of the additional requests we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| received from those areas for materials, supplies, and some increases in software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| maintenance. So that adds up to six million dollars in that area. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| questions on that? Okay, the next slide is really what we refer to as our fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| increases. So we have to, we really don't have a choice but to program these into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| our budget or, you know, we would be in, we would not be able to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| we're required to do. So an increase of 6.55 million amongst these four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| areas. It's debt service burden we're increasing in our general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2518)|

| 0:42:07| obligation to the amount that we have to pay to the trustees commission. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| was an increase in that area. As our per pupil expenditures increase, we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| to pass that on to the Emerald Charter School. So there was an increase in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| amount. And then we also look every year for savings. So we're not just always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| spending, we also look for realized savings, kind of scrub through every line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| item in the budget. And there was some savings to be had in the district level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| insurances. We switched banks so we were able to save on bank fees and our space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| costs for no longer being in the AJ building. So those were some areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| we we saw some savings in. And then the final slide to share with you is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| grouped it into administrative and operational increases of 2.7. The largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| part of that is the first bullet, which is a significant investment in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| school security and safety. So we'll be hiring 20 new school security positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| that will actually be out in the schools, a new investigator in that area, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| the software and supplies that go along with adding additional positions. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| next three bullets are positions for internal departments. So we're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| some new positions in technology to help with the one-to-one initiative. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| adding a new position in maintenance and operations for asset management, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| like that. And a position in public affairs, as well as we just invested in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| new communication for our students and families that we think will really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| reach them in a better way. And some coupon upgrades so that the schools will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| actually see the full $10 coupons book sales. So that's 2.7 million in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| administrative and operational increases. And so if you add all those three slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| I just talked through, along with Joe's slides, that's $49.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| increase in our expenditures. So you can see we presented to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| board a couple weeks ago a balanced budget at this point. So that's where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| are at this point. And so now we just have time if you guys have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| questions or anything you feel like we didn't cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=2654)|

| 0:51:59| June and if the board approves of that, then we will assess all of our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| playgrounds against that program standard and that program standard would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3125)|

| 0:52:21| make or set some priorities against how we want to address any playgrounds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| don't meet that standard. So, you know, if the board approves that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| approves the process, I think we'll be spending a whole lot more than $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| on playgrounds over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| We approved last month, I believe it was, $400,000 grant type funding for, it could be an outdoor classroom, it could be playground equipment, it could be for any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3164)|
| 0:53:09| any type of thing that an elementary or high school, middle school would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3189)|

| 0:53:19| Okay, so I'm assuming that would be taken into account in what you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| present to the board in June? That's totally different. That $400,000 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3203)|

| 0:53:58| there was a, there was a, and I guess you can call it an initiative approved, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| think, by the Commission, I think it was last month, maybe. And so the county is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| offering, it's essentially a grant or grants up to $400,000. It could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| series of grants. So it's actually to help for situations like, let's say a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| school support organization has raised funds, right, for a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3259)|

| 0:54:40| Let's say it's a $200,000 project. They've raised $100,000. They could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| apply for that grant. There would be a committee, I think, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| established consisting of both county and school staff. And so then they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| assess those applications and then reward accordingly. But again, it's, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| a lot of it is to help communities that, that have partially raised dollars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3305)|

| 0:56:13| And I'll, to segue off of what Commissioner Daly has said, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| requirements. So, if it's, let's say it's a structure of some sort on a school, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| school property, regardless, whatever the project is, it would have to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| it's built into the policy, it would have to be approved by the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Education, and it would also have to be, it would have to adhere to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| policies and procedures of the Moss County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| And so, the principals are already aware of this, or they will be soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| Right. So, I know some with, with kind of projects in the hopper, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| are aware of it. But, yeah, that's probably something, I'm not, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| sure if communication has went out on that or not, Russ, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Well, we haven't seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Okay, no, no, I know you're, yeah. So, I'll, I'll follow up with that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| And the committee has not been set up yet, either. So, it was just approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| last month. So, there's still some steps to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| And, and, and, like Ron says, it's, it's not limited purely to playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| It's, it could be any improvement project that I'm, as I'm aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| and then anything that will have to be constructed, whether it's a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| or some other facility on, will still have to go back through the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| vetting process to be approved before a trigger can be pulled on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| And then, this is to continue on, I guess, we're talking about playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| and stuff, but, I mean, I know a concern with all the schools all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| and so I don't know if this is going to be part of the standards part, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| mulch requirement, because that also tends to always go back on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And so, is that being looked at with this program standards for playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| We've been working on that for several years, and, and we don't, we don't call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| it mulch, we call it engineered wood fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Because, mulch is an agricultural product that has all sorts of stuff in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| But, that's something that, as a district, we can spend several hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| thousand dollars a year on, and, and we have been budgeting $50,000 a year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| us to help, we've been getting an additional $50,000 from the county on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| that, and, and we've been helping schools out with ground cover for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| several years, under the program standard, we would have to pick all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| that up, you know, so that's, that's what I'm saying, if, if the board adopts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| these program standards and wants us to move forward and assess our playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| against this, we're going to have to commit significant funds towards the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| maintenance of playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Well, and I, I just think that needs to be considered, because, I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| great to have a playground, but if you can't use it because you don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| correct mulch underneath it, it doesn't do us much good, so, I mean, I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| it's a whole package, I think there are reasons, probably, why we got away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| funding playgrounds, I don't think it's, because anybody doesn't think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| valuable or see the benefit in them, and, but I'm sure at some point, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| decision was made and it's been continued, and a lot is, it's money, I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| very expensive, and, well, I, and, and if it's a, if a decision was made, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| recent, I mean, I mean, you're talking half a century or more, oh, I mean, I, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| mean, my kids are now in their 20s, and when I was, I was fundraising for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| playgrounds when they were in kindergarten, so I know it goes back at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| least 20 years, but, you know, but I, but, I mean, it's a big, it's a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| financial consideration for the school system, and, and it's not the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| system, it's the county, too, because y'all are our funding body, so, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| while we all think, I mean, I think we all support the playgrounds, it is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| these things, if, if we're going to pay for it, where's the money coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| because, you know, the pot doesn't always get bigger, so that, that is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| these considerations, it's not that, you know, Mr. J came and made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| presentation, and I don't think anybody was against what he said, but it is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| of those things, what do you not fund if you're funding playgrounds? Right, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| I think that's a very good point, I mean, I think that if you ask every board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| member and every, every staff member, we would be all for funding all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| playgrounds, but the problem is, you know, well, then which, which pavement is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| going to get replaced, and which roofs are not going to get replaced, and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| know, so that, I'm sure that's, that's probably where it came, came into play, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| it's, it's going to be expensive, and so, you know, then we have to look at, does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| that go into the capital plan, does it come out of the general purpose budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| are we cutting positions, it's, it's, you know, I think we agree that it needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| be done, but it's going to be substantial. Yeah, and those are questions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| really have to develop some information before we can begin to answer. Even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| defining what is a playground. Yes. And, and Russ, I think you know this, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| you may have shorted the years that we've gone back and we have worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3664)|

| 1:01:20| PTAs, but I think this would be a good time to give Adam Parsons some credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| for all the work he does on your playgrounds and for all the effort he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| put into developing this program that you're currently working on. Yeah, Adam is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3689)|

| 1:01:42| playground inspection process. We started out just trying to look at all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| playgrounds every six months and I think we're doing it four times a year right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| now to inspect them for safety and to make, make repairs on that. And Adam's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| been instrumental in that. I think our maintenance department and grounds crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| have really been helpful in that process too. We've got equipment that some, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| some places you can't get parts for and we've paid to have parts manufactured in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| order to put those pieces of equipment back into service again. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| everybody's gone, gone a long way on this. We'll see where we get to over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| several months where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| Any other questions? All right, so let's go ahead and move into school capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| And I've only got 65 slides on this. No, but do you have something Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3759)|
| 1:02:50| Russ, I want to discuss this because we often get into these discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| capacity and how much capacity do we have. And you know I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3773)|

| 1:03:03| understand it. You know it's a, it's a function of your actual building square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3783)|

| 1:03:17| different with different programmings and have almost the same capacity. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| wanted to give you an opportunity to explain that to me and to everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| so that we could all understand that a little bit better. Yeah, I want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| about it from the 30,000 foot level here and put some information out. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3809)|

| 1:03:40| put together about 15 years ago by an architectural firm that gets really in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| depth about you know how to calculate school capacity and how the use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| school drives capacity and all that. So if you really want to get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| the deep parts of it that's a that's a great presentation to look at. And it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| the concepts that are in that presentation are what we build our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| calculations off of. So let me start, you know, school capacity sounds simple and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3847)|
| 1:04:19| we've got an old saw that we use around the staff. It's like just give me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220511-joint-education-committee?start=3859)|
