| 0:07:36| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=456.0)|

| 0:07:43| And I have some photographs of the property over the course of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=463.0)|
| 0:07:46| that he's been doing the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=466.0)|
| 0:07:47| I don't know if, like, I can hand it and you all can pass them around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=467.0)|
| 0:07:50| so you just kind of have an idea of what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=470.0)|
| 0:07:52| and what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=472.0)|
| 0:07:56| Yes, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=476.0)|
| 0:07:58| Cassie Kiesler, 4712 Hazelnut Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=478.0)|
| 0:08:03| And I think I've got them in reverse order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=483.0)|
| 0:08:06| from the farms back when he first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=486.0)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=489.0)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=490.0)|
| 0:08:12| So do you want me to talk or do you want to wait until you kind of get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=492.0)|
| 0:08:14| chance to look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=494.0)|
| 0:08:15| Oh, look, there it is, part of it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=495.0)|
| 0:08:19| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=499.0)|
| 0:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=500.0)|
| 0:08:21| So I live just down the creek from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=501.0)|
| 0:08:27| And originally it started out that the permits and things that were pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=507.0)|
| 0:08:30| for this property were for a single-family residential dwelling with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=510.0)|
| 0:08:35| detached garage, which from the time he started building that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:39| that was never his intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=519.0)|
| 0:08:42| And he has also changed the grade of the land there pretty dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=522.0)|
| 0:08:47| That's in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=527.0)|
| 0:08:50| And as someone who lives down the creek from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=530.0)|
| 0:08:52| because he's backfilled so much of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=532.0)|
| 0:08:55| it has severely impacted drainage and more flooding on my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=535.0)|
| 0:09:00| and my neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=540.0)|
| 0:09:03| And to my knowledge, he has not pulled any of the correct permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=543.0)|
| 0:09:06| or done any of the things that he is supposed to do to change the land the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=546.0)|
| 0:09:10| way he has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=550.0)|
| 0:09:13| So I have a problem with the fact that he's just kind of doing whatever he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=553.0)|
| 0:09:16| wants and then coming up later and asking for permission after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=556.0)|
| 0:09:23| I just really have issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=563.0)|
| 0:09:26| And he owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:27| You can kind of see the driveway across the street kind of catty corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=567.0)|
| 0:09:31| which is also still listed as a single-family with a detached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=571.0)|
| 0:09:36| And he's run that concrete business out of there for, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=576.0)|
| 0:09:40| four or five years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=580.0)|
| 0:09:42| And he parks heavy equipment and big trucks there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=582.0)|
| 0:09:45| which is the same thing he started doing at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=585.0)|
| 0:09:48| which he said that they weren't going to park the trucks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=588.0)|
| 0:09:52| They might come and go during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=592.0)|
| 0:09:54| But there are large pieces of equipment and trucks sitting there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=594.0)|
| 0:09:58| So, I mean, he just says one thing and then does another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=598.0)|
| 0:10:01| And I didn't think that's how we did things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=601.0)|
| 0:10:05| Maybe I'm just naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:09| Will you please reset your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=609.0)|
| 0:10:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:12| It's Cassie Kiesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=612.0)|
| 0:10:13| Can you spell that, your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=613.0)|
| 0:10:15| K-I-E-S-T-L-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=615.0)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:21| Any questions for Ms. Kiesler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=621.0)|
| 0:10:23| I know the pictures are going around now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=623.0)|
| 0:10:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:28| If not, sir, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=628.0)|
| 0:10:36| If so, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=636.0)|
| 0:10:41| Alvin Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:43| Alvin Austin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=643.0)|
| 0:10:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=644.0)|
| 0:10:45| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=645.0)|
| 0:10:46| 6715 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=647.0)|
| 0:10:48| And if he's going to run it as a business, I've got a small business right up the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=648.0)|
| 0:10:54| And, of course, I've got a smaller lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=654.0)|
| 0:10:56| And one of the things that I had with the county was Holden Pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=656.0)|
| 0:11:02| which I eventually finally got away because my lot was just too small for the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=662.0)|
| 0:11:07| and the Holden Pond, he has adequate room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=667.0)|
| 0:11:10| You know, if you're going to be having tractor and trailer trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=670.0)|
| 0:11:13| large trucks that might have an oil spill or diesel spill or something like that, you need a Holden Pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:20| The number two thing is if he's going to run a business out of there, you've got to have handicap accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=680.0)|
| 0:11:27| This house is not handicap accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=687.0)|
| 0:11:30| So he's already running the business out of there and has been for now for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=690.0)|
| 0:11:37| So, you know, it's kind of the type of thing is if you allow him to proceed, how much farther will he go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=697.0)|
| 0:11:45| You know, where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=705.0)|
| 0:11:48| I had heard rumors that he wanted to put a batch plant in there to mix his own concrete and stuff like that at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=708.0)|
| 0:11:56| So does it proceed into something like that, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=716.0)|
| 0:12:00| And that's what's got us more concerned on it because it's just not a good location for that particular thing, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=720.0)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:13| It also, his property backs up to the creek, and you can kind of see in the very forefront of that photo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=733.0)|
| 0:12:20| where he cleared some of the land out and piled up the brush right against the creek bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=740.0)|
| 0:12:24| and I have a picture of it, and then there's another picture farther in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=744.0)|
| 0:12:27| where some of that washed down across other people's properties and has hit your fence right up against the edge of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=747.0)|
| 0:12:35| And he's never cleared that up, never cleaned any of that up, you know, with the trucks and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=755.0)|
| 0:12:42| And he's got a large commercial gas tank, like, that you would fill a heavy truck with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=762.0)|
| 0:12:47| Like, it's probably, what, 300, 400 gallons that's sitting right at the edge of that graded space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=767.0)|
| 0:12:54| which is in the floodplain, which is kind of concerning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=774.0)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=786.0)|
| 0:13:11| Commissioner, since the applicant isn't here, we just discussed with our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=791.0)|
| 0:13:17| we can't really deliberate this at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=797.0)|
| 0:13:20| It's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=800.0)|
| 0:13:22| They are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=802.0)|
| 0:13:23| We're allowing them to voice their opinion, and you're more than welcome to come back next month as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=803.0)|
| 0:13:27| but since you're here, we wanted to allow you the time to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=807.0)|
| 0:13:31| Do you know why it was deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=811.0)|
| 0:13:37| It was at their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=817.0)|
| 0:13:39| There's a letter he sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=819.0)|
| 0:13:42| Basically, it says they're working to purchase a new property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=822.0)|
| 0:13:46| that would be appropriately zoned for the repair of its vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=826.0)|
| 0:13:50| So, potentially, it's to maybe not be located at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=830.0)|
| 0:13:58| And don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=838.0)|
| 0:14:00| Like, I'm not anti-business, small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=840.0)|
| 0:14:03| Like, I want people to be able to make a living and do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=843.0)|
| 0:14:06| I just want them to go about it in the correct way, following the laws and regulations that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=846.0)|
| 0:14:13| You know, I would do that if I was trying to start a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:16| I would come and do the things that I needed to do in the right order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=856.0)|

| 0:14:23| That is the reason it was deferred to go to engineering, and engineering is checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=863.0)|
| 0:14:28| so you need to come back next month because a lot of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=868.0)|
| 0:14:32| it's what you brought up, already was brought up last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=872.0)|
| 0:14:35| That's why it was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=875.0)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=876.0)|
| 0:14:41| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=881.0)|
| 0:14:43| Just one question to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=883.0)|
| 0:14:47| If, in fact, he is operating a business, though, without a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=887.0)|
| 0:14:53| is that anything that could be taken action on until we do finish with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=893.0)|
| 0:15:03| You know, this gentleman owns a piece of property on the north side of Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=903.0)|
| 0:15:07| that we have him under a notice of violation for that of running a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=907.0)|
| 0:15:12| This particular location, I don't believe we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=912.0)|
| 0:15:16| He has got a permit from our office to build a single-family home here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=916.0)|
| 0:15:21| but it's permitted as a residential structure, not a commercial structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=921.0)|
| 0:15:24| He is currently running his business out of the new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=924.0)|
| 0:15:27| He has his office girls coming and going every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=927.0)|
| 0:15:31| And we can check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=931.0)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=935.0)|

| 0:17:42| We have a concept plan approved subject to rezoning for 47,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1062.0)|

| 0:18:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1086.0)|
| 0:18:07| There's six trailers on the front, and the rest is just open pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1087.0)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1092.0)|

| 0:18:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1096.0)|

| 0:18:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1105.0)|
| 0:18:26| So the residents in the mobile homes are currently on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1106.0)|
| 0:18:29| and have been for the last two years on a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1109.0)|

| 0:18:43| And we have asked since day one for the current property owner to notify his leasehors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1123.0)|
| 0:18:50| that he is selling the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1130.0)|
| 0:18:52| and that the new owner may choose to do something differently than the six trailers that are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1132.0)|
| 0:18:59| And I have a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1139.0)|
| 0:19:00| I don't have it with me, but I have a letter from our attorney I can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1140.0)|
| 0:19:03| But we're well within state statute for tenant rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1143.0)|
| 0:19:07| based on the terms of their lease being month-to-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1147.0)|
| 0:19:09| We owe them 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1149.0)|
| 0:19:10| We're giving them 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1150.0)|
| 0:19:15| I'd like to make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to MDR land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1155.0)|
| 0:19:21| because it provides a transitional land use between the adjacent commercial and single-family land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1161.0)|
| 0:19:31| Motion to approve Planning Commission's recommendation for the sector plan to MDR by Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1171.0)|

| 0:19:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1199.0)|

| 0:20:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1201.0)|

| 0:20:12| East of the trailers would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1212.0)|
| 0:20:14| It looks like three dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1214.0)|
| 0:20:16| East of the property is a rent-assisted elderly apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1216.0)|

| 0:20:28| but now owned by about three other entities that are taking the tax credits or whatever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1228.0)|
| 0:20:34| Is that part of your total 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=1234.0)|
