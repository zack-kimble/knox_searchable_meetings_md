| 0:00:50| At this time, I'm going to ask Grant Rosenberg to lead us in the pledge of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=64)|
| 0:01:20| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=86)|

| 0:01:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| I'm going to ask that the law director's office take over for the swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| We just did the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| We're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=100)|

| 0:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Mr. Chairman, they've been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Clerk, first order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| It's not on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Consideration of suspension, revocation, following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| TRJ Market and Enterprises, LLC, doing business as Pioneer Market, 8119 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:39| Mulletton owner, permit holder shall appear before the Knox County Commission and give good cause why their beer license should not be suspended or revoked for failing to timely pay the fine assessed on January 26, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:53| Such appearance is required regardless if the fine is paid prior to the date of the meeting announced herein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| UK Minot, would you please go to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Please state your name and position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| UK Minot, Knox County Beer Board Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Mr. Minot, regarding the agenda that we have here before us today in printed form, did you, in fact, deliver a copy of this to the party in Item 5A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:28| I delivered a copy when I took the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| And I'll state for the record that we've likewise mailed this, but they did, in fact, get personal service by UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Clerk, have they paid the fine yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| They have yet to pay the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| And I believe the beer board back in January took action to give them a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine, and they have yet to make the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=231)|
| 0:04:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| That is correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| But when I went up there, when I first found out that he hadn't paid it, I went to the law department, and he said, I'll handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:14| I'll write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Well, I went up there a week later and asked the owner if he had a letter, and he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| He wanted to pay me the $500, and I said, hey, I can't take it because they're liable to take your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| So the man offered to pay it, and I told him no, not until I found out from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| There's nothing in the beer laws, nothing in the state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| It's your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Mr. Manning, did you tell him that he'd need to come down and pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Is he here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| He is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| He's here and he's got the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| He's here and he's got the check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| He's a few months late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| We've got a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| I'll just start out with Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Do we send a letter asking for signatures when they send you a letter out, asking them to sign that they got their letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| certified letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| No, sir, not generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Normally, that's not a procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| When we have someone that's unpaid, normally there's extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| We try to attempt to discern why that wasn't paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and that's why we had UK Minot go out there and actually give them a copy of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| which clearly requires them to come forward and give good cause why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| And when they were initially cited, they were advised within seven days to pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| So this is something that is very unusual anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| I think it's the first time I've had it come up since I've been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| UK, you said something about the Knox County does not address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| State law does not address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| It's entirely up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| What were you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Commissioner, the only one that they address, the state law, is on the $100 beer fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| It's due January the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| If it's not paid, it's in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| They have 10 days after you get a certified letter to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| And if it's not paid then, we can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| But we don't have anything that says if they don't come down here and pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| I know what you all told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| They've got seven days to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| But he offered it to me, and I told him I couldn't take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| Well, I think the fact the gentleman offered it to you shows that he was wanting to pay in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| It seems like we've got some ambiguity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Mr. Law Director, should we clarify our rules to say that you will pay within seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| and if not, somebody is going to come out and padlock you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| I mean, if it's not there and if it's not specifically stated, then perhaps we should specifically state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| And that's why I'm asking when he made that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I'm thinking it needs to be clarified if it's not clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Mr. Law Director, in answering Commissioner Hammond's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| when we, by our rules, we give them a $500 fine or 30 days, it's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| And it's my assumption that if they decide not to pay the $500, they've made their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| I mean, that's the way I take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| But if the Law Director would like to address the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Well, I mean, the bottom line is they're advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| They can certainly have even greater clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| but they're put on notice when they're here what the consequences are for failure to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| I would suggest that if you would, Mr. Law Director, let's look at possible greater clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| because if there's any ambiguity at all, it's easier to clarify it and just say if you haven't paid within seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| it's immediate 30-day suspension and you're padlocked on day number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I mean, it would just seem to me that if it's clear, then that way we don't get into lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| and get into all this wrangling about what does it say, what was the intent, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| If you would look at that, maybe we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| And if you feel we don't, if you could report back to us next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Done, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Yeah, I'd just like to make a couple of comments in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| I know this gentleman, and I know that he's had some unusual circumstances and that he's been dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:32| and I know this has been part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| But as the old saying goes, ignorance of the law is no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| But I feel like that since he did offer to pay Mr. Minot, even though I'm not sure what that date was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| that in this case we need to go ahead and accept that and reinstate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| And I would make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I'll second Mr. Brown's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| Would the owner like to address this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| And if you'll give your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| and if you'd like to tell us why that you failed to pay this on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| Jumhur Mutlikan, owner of the TRJ Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Well, circumstances, I had it at the check ready, but I have another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| As soon as I get out of here, I just go to my job, and then just kind of a time got away from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and I'm being shorthanded at the store, so I have to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| And one thing lead to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| The next thing I know, Mr. Minot came up there to remind me, but I asked him if I can go ahead and pay him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| He said, no, you're already on the need to go back to the board and see what happens there, and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| When was the date that Mr. Minot was out there and you offered to make that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| About two weeks ago, I believe, two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| About either two or three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Okay, so not quite a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| So we're still talking, what, first of April, end of March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Yeah, right about there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Okay, so you're still about two months late in trying to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| I just think it sets a bad precedent that if someone fails to pay it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| that we just go back and give them the same fine that we gave them the first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Well, in defense of that, I think that maybe the ball was dropped on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| Maybe we don't have the correct follow-up to see that these things are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and we're not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Who's checking after seven days to see if it's been paid so that we could or somebody could follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| I'm going to ask the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Clerk, do you all notify these beer permit holders if they have not paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:07| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I think that seems to be the question of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Once a possible fine or a suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| who follows up to make sure that these individuals know the consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| Usually they're paid before the seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| This is the first time this has ever occurred, but usually after seven days, UK usually goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:38| UK, did you go out and notify them after the seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| or were they ever notified between the time that they appeared before us in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| and the time that you went out there to inform them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Mr. Chairman, when the clerk's office notified me, I notified the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| I took him a copy in there with the address of the place of business and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| I'll write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| So, no, I didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| The law director is trying to find to see if we do have a penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| or if we're already fairly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| No, Mr. Chairman, maybe we need to have UK to go out if they haven't paid this fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| but at least they, because a lot of these little mom and pop grocery stores, like the gentleman says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| they get tied up, they work 12, 16 hours a day, their health is bad and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| and let him go out and remind them at least by the eighth day that this money is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And if they want to pay it and make the check to Knox County, we should give him the authority to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| Write a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| And write a receipt, but the check be made to Knox County and eliminate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| This may never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Like Angie said, she's been here I don't know how many years, but this is the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| But it may eliminate this ever happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| We had it the first of this year, I believe, Mr. Pinkston, Angie's Market and Deli on Johnsonville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| or Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I had to go up there and she took me back and showed me where she wrote the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| Well, three weeks later, we didn't, it might have been last year, but we didn't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| But she had it in her checkbook where she had wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| We don't know where it's been mailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| We've got seven places in Knox County they can pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| What you need to do in a case like that, Mr. Mining, is be able to take a new check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| and leave it up to them to stop payment on the old check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| That's their responsibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| I've got the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| You can't do it without the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Mr. Law Director, I am concerned that somebody just doesn't pay their fine, just like Chairman Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| But I think, do we have the mechanism here to increase the fine or do anything like that if this guy hasn't paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:20| Currently, as your rules read, you're bound to, when someone has an offense of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| generally you either adhere to your original writings, which is the suspension of 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| or you suspend your rules by two-thirds majority vote, and in so doing, issue a harsher penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| But one thing I do want to make clear, with all due respect to Mr. Minoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| state law does, in fact, outline with specificity what occurs if you do not pay your fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| Tennessee Code 575108 reads that, in fact, you have seven days to pay the civil penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| and if not, you will have suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| And likewise, our new ordinance that the Board will consider today for final reading reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| If a civil penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| that the permittee will have seven days within which to pay the civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| So state law does, in fact, provide the seven-day rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Your new ordinance outlines the specificity of the seven-day rule, that if they fail to pay, you get an automatic suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| Now, whether we need to make sure we have a tickler system within the clerk's office to notify my office on day eight, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| But it is in state law, previously has been for quite some time, and it is in your new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| But it's not in the current ordinance that we're operating under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Under your current ordinance, realistically, you can really go two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| One, for the individual the opportunity to just pay today or, on the alternative, suspend your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| and go for the harsher penalty of revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Do you have the check to pay today, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We have a motion on the floor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Let's offer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Well, before we get to that, just real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| since this is not a hearing where we follow the rules of $500 or 30-day suspension, we're talking about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| We're talking about a gentleman here that failed to abide by the ruling that this body had back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| So I don't know that this is considered a first offense now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| We're talking about someone who has failed to act within our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| So would we have to suspend our rules if someone wanted to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| I think the problem lies in the fact that we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Double or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| I think the problem lies we don't have any facts or anything in our code that allows us or guides us on how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| And so I think following with caution, just let sleeping dogs lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| and then our new ordinance has something to deal with it, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| My opinion is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I believe the law director just said that we could let him pay this fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| It's up to our discretion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Is that the way I'm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| You have discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| When you have a situation like this, generally, as I'm sure you're well aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| you either have mitigating circumstances where you feel that a harsher penalty isn't justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| or you feel the person is being cavalier and merely ignoring the county, and then you can go to a harsher penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| I think what one of the mitigating circumstances you'll have to consider is that your beer inspector testified under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| that an attempt was made, albeit lately in a tardy manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| but nevertheless made an attempt prior to this hearing to pay, and he rejected that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| So, again, these are mitigating circumstances the board can consider, but it need not consider them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| We've got a motion on the floor and probably a second call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Do you want to go through a call or do you just want to go ahead and just vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I'd rather just go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Then you want to take away your call so we don't have to vote on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| If you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| We got Commissioner Briggs and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Any other nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Sir, you need to go pay the fine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| You need to go to the clerk's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| You can't tell him he's got to go to the clerk's office and not pay you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1100)|

| 0:18:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1128)|

| 0:19:10| On March 12, 2009, we conducted an underage beer sting at the Quick Shop 7657 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:20| and our undercover officer was sold alcohol, a six-pack of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| Now, I noticed on the agenda you have this as a third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And according to the records maintained by the clerk, it's my understanding you reviewed this within a 36-month period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| What's the dates on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Do you have the dates on the previous offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| The clerk does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:56| I only have two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| I think she's got all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| August 27, 2007 was one offense and the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| That's the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| That's the second and the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| April of 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| April of 04?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| That's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| That's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Then we're talking, really, this would technically be considered a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It's got to be within 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| The August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| We're having a meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| If you'll just give us just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:50| On the August 27th minutes, which is when they're saying was the third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:59| well, what we're saying is being the second offense was actually at that time their third offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| and they moved it back to only being a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| This has obviously been a business that has offended multiple times, even more so than what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:22| Ms. Clerk, what's the dates of all the offenses, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Whether or not they were ruled first, second, or third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| August 27th is their second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| August 27, 2007 was their second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| It was considered a second offense at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| Mr. Law, could you rule whether or not this, in your opinion, is a second or third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| Sir, did you say you wrote them up again in March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Did you write them up again in March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Well, they paid a fine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| It looks like 8-2707.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| They paid $1,000 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| That was the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Then they had another date they paid here was 1-2209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| That was this one here would have been the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| That's this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| I think what's happened is the time frame between the first and the third has exceeded the 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| It sounds like as they've been here, a previous one has dropped off within that 36-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| So it's a matter of do we go back 36 months from today, how many offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| or do we go back and say at the time that their second offense, there was actually a previous one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| And do we accumulate at that time or do we simply go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| In my opinion, I think you have to go as of today how many offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I mean, in order to adhere, we do process correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| We need three offenses within 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| If we don't have that, we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| While that may be correct, any other instance still sets a precedent for what's been done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| and I think that needs to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| What we're doing today, if we follow our rules, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| is that we're looking at a second offense, which is $1,000 or 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| unless we suspend the rules to do something differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So unless I hear that, I'm going to go to Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I would agree with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| It looks to me like we have a pattern here, even though it's over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| So technically it may be the second offense since the last offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| but I think we should consider revocation this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| I mean, obviously the $1,000 or $500 or whatever is not getting the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| and we're not having compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Well, even with staying within our rules, we could do a 60-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| and not even give the $1,000 option if someone wishes to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Yes, I would like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| So your motion is 60-day suspension of the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Do I hear a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Commissioner Harmon, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| You got my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Did they check ID, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Did they check the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| This one was kind of strange because we had actually done one right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| The people down the street actually called the clerk and told him we were out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and he still sold to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I'd like to make a substitute motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| and to suspend it for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| So what we have is we have a substitute motion to suspend the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| and then what I'll do is I'll come back to you as to what you want to do after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| if we decide to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| We have a motion and a second to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I'd like to make a motion to suspend for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Is someone here from QuickShop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I was going to get to that here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:36| My name is Danny Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| I'm the vice president of Marsh Co. LLC, located in Greenville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| Is there anything you would like to add to the conversation about what you're hearing here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| what you intend to do to make sure this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Well, let me just start by saying we continue to battle this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| We can continue to hire people and train people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| This gentleman was on the job for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| He went through the training process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| This was his first shift alone and made the mistake of picking the ID up and not reading it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:20| Even after he got a phone call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Is he still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| He's terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| He's been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| He's been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| I mean, we continue to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| We continue to hire people, go through the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| It's our industry, and we try to get better in doing what we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| And hopefully, with the economy the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| when we get some of these people off of unemployment, we might be able to hire better people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| That's kind of the goal to look forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Mr. Hammond, are you any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| You're looking at a four-month suspension of your beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| What impact is that going to have on you in that store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I would say that I would do this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| If you proceeded to give me four months, I'd close the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| I would close the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| The revenues that the state's going to lose is probably, in my guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| would be an estimate of $50,000 to $60,000 in taxes, in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| You know, I agree that we need to send a strong message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| but I've been on this beer board now for about six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| We've never considered a 104-month suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| The effect it has on this gentleman's business is going to be catastrophic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| I'm wondering if 120 days is perhaps a harsh penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| even though I know that we're trying to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| I am in favor of a revocation of some period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| but four months is a long time, particularly since, in my memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| we haven't done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Not that we couldn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| but just looking at the ramifications from a business standpoint, too, I'm still thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Mr. Hammond solved my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| You know, we're not up here to put people out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And I realize that employees sometimes make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And I don't know what this gentleman's employment was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| but I'm dead against putting somebody out of business just because we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| And your name again, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Danny Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Mr. Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| We have this problem and have had this problem in several businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| This comes up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Do you have suggestions after you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| How many times have you experienced this personally as the owner of this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| At this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| At this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Well, any location, in any business that you have, how many times have you had somebody fail in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| I guess in my career probably maybe ten times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| In all of that experience, do you have suggestions for us about how to structure our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| so that we can do something about it or make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| It's obviously beyond your ability to address or you would have fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| I think that, like I said, we continue to do training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| We continue to make our phone calls to the stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| And I think we all know here in this room the clientele that we have out there that we have to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and choose from to hire, and it gets tougher every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| I can train this employee for 30 days and never put them on the front lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| If you've ever worked at a convenience store at a cash register at 530 at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| I would imagine it's probably like being in Iraq on the front lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| It's pretty tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| It's no easy job at $7 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| And so, I mean, it's almost like putting your child behind the wheel of a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| and telling them not to speed, not to run a stoplight, not to drink and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| They may come back home and that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| You put them back behind the wheel of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I mean, it's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| We obviously don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| I'm not for putting anybody out of business at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| but I am against young people, especially in Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| where they've had death after death after traffic death, being sold alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| And your store seems to be consistent with selling young people alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:28| You know, I'm torn that we do need to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And I certainly don't want to put somebody out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| but I'm sick and tired of businesses coming up here and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| what do you want me to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Well, what I want you to do is look at the driver's license that stands up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| that says under 21 versus the one that says nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| That's what I want you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I want you to adhere to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And someday somebody's kid that owns a business is going to get killed by a drunk driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| that was sold to somebody else by somebody else that couldn't read a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| And Wednesdays you guys are going to wake up and stop listening to the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| and start using common sense and doing what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| Can I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| First of all, you just said that we sit here and we sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I mean, I'm not going to sit there and say that I sell to minors every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| This gentleman sent a minor in there and the employee made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| That was out of how many customers that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So, I mean, for you to tell me that I'm selling to minors every day, I take offense to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| And I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| You don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Wolfie, can you come up here just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I want to tag on what Brad has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Clarify for me, Wolfie, and the rest of the commissioners and for the people out in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| You come into a store or the person doing the steam whatever and they have the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| Tell us the difference on the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| The under 21 has a red stripe by their picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| I passed one around at the last commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| It's very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| It says under 21 until a certain date, until their 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| All of our undercover people have an ID, has a red stripe, and it says under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| This is what I don't understand from business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| You know, guys, it's just a color code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| It doesn't get any simpler than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| If it's got a red stripe, they need to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I'm with Brad here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| I mean, the state has made it extremely easy to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| And then you've got a counter on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I know it gets busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| We all get busy with what we do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| And I'm like the other commissioners, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I don't want to put somebody out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| But then, especially in the Powell area, too many people have been killed over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| I mean, guys, it's just a simple color code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| It does not get any easier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| You know, if this was one data point, okay, I agree, tough economic times and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| This has been chronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| It meets a sliding scale 36-month time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| This has been chronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| This store has chronically sold to underage officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| And you can't sit here and tell me that the only people that are getting caught are the underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| or being successful are the underage officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| With those data points, I have to come to the conclusion that you are selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| I won't say routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| But you are selling to underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Okay, it bothers me that one of your justifications is economic impact to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| and to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| That's no justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I'd rather have an unbalanced budget and minors not being sold alcohol than to meet the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| because we're just going to keep you in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Okay, if it comes down to your business or minor drinking, because studies show they don't know how to safely drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| in mass, binge drinking is prevalent at that age group, which is why you pass laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| There's a reason for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| They're just not throwing out a number, 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| There's reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| There's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| And you're violating the law, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| You've been caught violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| So I'm not going to say I want your business to stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| I'm going to say if you're not going to clean it up, close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| I mean, we have accident after accident after accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Minors are minors, you know, and they don't have the full capabilities in terms of reasoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| in terms of understanding when they're impaired, and as it relates to their ability to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| They're fairly new drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| So, again, there's all kinds of justifications why they pass laws the way they do, especially with this age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| Am I on a soapbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, I'm on a soapbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| But I'm going to stand behind if Commissioner Anders wants to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| I will vote to revoke your license for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| This isn't one data point because tough economic times in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| This has been going back at least to 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I have an aunt who has spent the last 14 years in a nursing home paralyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| because an underage drinker, someone sold a teenager beer that slammed into the back of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| while she was stopped at a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| I think that's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I'm not going to talk about the catastrophic effects on businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| It has a catastrophic effect on people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| And the second thing is I really don't like you trivializing the service that our soldiers are doing in Iraq| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| by comparing it to working in a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| That's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I appreciate the enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| We're going to move on to Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| I worked my way through college in a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| I understand when people get off from work and they want to buy a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| and they want to buy a cigarette, you've got a long line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Even when I was working at the register, we didn't have the fancy registers with the mount and tendon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I'm going to date myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| I had to make change from just a regular old drawer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| And I had to look at people's driver's license, and I didn't have a red flag on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And I can't tell you the number of years I worked for a prominent convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| that's now sold out in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I never had any problems that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I don't know of any of his stores that I can recall them ever having any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I did a lot of training for that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| But in today's time, and as simple as we have made it at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| I mean, even if you're colorblind, you can see a spot going across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| And I'm hard-pressed to say that there's any excuse that a businessman can make before this body today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| that will convince me that we're trying to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| and we're trying to blame it on somebody that, quote, is maybe functionally illiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| The bottom line is, though, you hired the person, and the responsibility is upon you and your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| Just like when the people hire me, the responsibility is on them for hiring me and making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| We have to live with the decisions we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And as bad as I hate to say it, I'm leaning toward the rest of commission, at least in Brad's motion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| because we get people hurt, we get people killed, we get young people mangled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| This is really a serious thing, and I think we need to do much better, and I'm really disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| As I said at the last beer board meeting, I'm going to agree with Commissioner Norman over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| We have a problem here, and I don't know what the answer is, and apparently he doesn't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| But what you have to realize, this gentleman here didn't sell the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| He hired an individual, and the state has made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| We have to come up with some way to punish these clerks that are selling this beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:52| because I've owned a convenience store, I've worked in one, and you have no control over the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| just like the mayor has no control over everybody that works here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| If you had control, you wouldn't have people stealing from you in these stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I'm talking about the employees stealing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| I don't know what the answer is, but we have to come up with something to punish this employee that sells the beer instead of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| Now, you have a lot of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| It is a red line thing, but they don't pay any attention to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| and this gentleman here has no control over that, and I'm not taking up for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| I realize we have a problem, but I'm looking for the law department to come up with something, like I said last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| somehow to punish the people that are selling this beer, not just the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| He pays the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| He's liable to lose his license for something that he had no control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| and it means the difference in him staying in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| But if we can do something to punish the people that sell it, the clerk that sells it, then maybe we can slow this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| But we already have people in right now that are in business in these convenience stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Believe it or not, they run their own sting checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| I think Mr. Minot will attest to that, that some of these people run their own checks trying to protect themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| and they're still not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| They still get caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| So it looks like a lot of the owners are taking all the precautions they can to try to stop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| but the clerks are still selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Now, what the answer is, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Maybe we need to come down and give the clerks some time or find him big without the owner paying or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| I don't know what it is, but we've got to come up with something to punish someone besides the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| Some of these are chain organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| The guy that owns it may be up in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| But we've asked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| They send them to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| They're doing everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| They're running their own sting operations, and nothing is still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Mr. Law Director, would you like to respond to Commissioner Pink's statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| In the ordinance that I drafted for the Board that will be going through second review today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| in Section 4.9 there is actually a penalty phase directed precisely towards the seller, in other words, the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:11| Now, it does give you the option as to whether or not you want to penalize a clerk, depending upon the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| It provides you with the penalties provided by Tennessee law, which is a fine up to $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| and that's regardless if this person is criminally prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Or you also have the alternative to send them to remedial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| So that is in the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| However, you can't enforce that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| If you pass your ordinance today on second reading, you'll have that built-in protection as provided by Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| Did you want to respond to that at all, or we'll just move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| I have a 16-year-old daughter with an 18-year-old boyfriend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| and my husband and I are very fortunate in that they're very open with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and talk with us freely about their friends and issues and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| And what concerns me about you having a record of selling to underage minors is that kids tell each other where you can go buy beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:13| And I'm concerned that your store may have a reputation among underage drinkers that they can go buy beer there pretty easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:22| Kids share this information with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| And I don't have a problem with suspending your license for 120 days if it protects our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:37| I appreciate your comment, but I will have to say I could go get the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| My turnover at that location is probably 600%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| I've got a new manager back here that I think very highly of who has went in and cleaned the store up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| We have made significant moves to make the store better for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| And we've tried to train our people a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| And yet your store continues to have this problem where other stores don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Mr. Law Director, does this 90-day suspension prohibit a new owner from obtaining a beer license there at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:24| or is that just the revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| No, it won't affect a subsequent owner, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I'll run that by us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I was just making sure that it didn't affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| In the city, if you get revoked, you can't have a beer license for ten years at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I was just making sure this didn't affect a subsequent owner if there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| You know, I do struggle with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| And I don't believe that you have the intention of opening a store and selling an alcohol to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:59| But I do believe that two offenses is a significant amount in my community where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:10| And although I don't want to put anybody out of business, like I said, I don't want you selling beer to underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| And I don't want you to think that, you know, in August of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| you probably wrote that $1,000 check and it didn't affect your beer sales at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| We've got to send a message to businesses that, you know, if you want to sell beer in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| you're going to have to do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| And I don't know any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I'm like Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| I don't know any other way to do that than the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| You know, the clerk gets fined criminally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| They've got a criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| You pay a $1,000 fine, you know, $1,000 is nothing to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| And I just struggle with allowing you to sell beer whenever you come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| and tell us that all I can do is send them the training you required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| You know, you blame us for not having good enough training pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| And I just don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| And I respect Commissioner Hammond's thought on putting somebody out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| and thinking that this could put your store out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| That does bother me somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| But I just can't stand for the kids in my community being able to go up on Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| and buy alcohol there any time they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| As Mr. Pinkston said, we've talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| and I don't know what the process will be legally, Mr. Jarrett, as far as our second reading goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:51| But I hope that when we get to that point we use this as an example and we, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| at least the interpretation of the ordinance is not such that a penalty that is given to the actual clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| is some kind of option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| I hope the understanding is that the ordinance will convey the message that you will be fined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| and you will be fined a minimum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| I thought, and we suggested this earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| that that minimum amount would be something in the area of a $100 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Now, Mr. Jarrett's got to make this all work, and the law department's got to make this all work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| But I really think that if we don't make some kind of change like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| we're just doing the same thing, and the same thing is not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| and it's not working for Mr. Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| That would be an assist to him as a business owner, and I just think it's incumbent on us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| You know, this is a subject that probably hit all of us in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| I know it did with my brother who was killed because of a college student going the wrong way on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:19| You ask what can be done, Mr. Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Let me give you my take on what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| You see, we could sit up here all day and fine these $7 an hour people $100, $200, $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| But people making $7 an hour can't pay a $100 fine, a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| You know, what are they going to pay it with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| They're not working now because they've lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Most generally they're probably college students or some, you know, that type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| The only way I see that you and anybody else in the business can do better is you're going to have to invest a little too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2933)|
| 0:49:03| You're going to have to pay more to get better people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| If you do that, then people who are paid more realize they have more responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| You know, you take somebody out here working $7 an hour, they can make the same thing sitting in a shade pulling a rake for some farmer out here, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:28| I'm not criticizing what you're paying, but I'm just saying that you get what you pay for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| And unfortunately, I mean myself, trying to hire help around my place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| I've paid a lot more than that to try to get people that would do what I wanted done the way I wanted it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| So if you want to have an establishment that can do this, then you're going to have to invest in it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| Now, you've said a moment ago that if you shut down, that's $50,000 a month that the state's not going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:07| Is that the price you're going to put on one human life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| I would agree with the rest of these folks up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| You know, something has to be done, and the state has made it as simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| They don't have to figure the dates and, you know, I just miscalculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I thought that was a six or a seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| That don't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| If it's got that strip on there, you know, you don't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| That's the way it works, and it's the way it ought to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| That doesn't take but one split second to look at that strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| So, you know, I don't have a whole lot of sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| Mr. Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| I just want to make a couple of quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I will also have to back up the rest of my commissioners and vote along with Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| I'm not for putting businesses out of business, but I've had two teenagers, two grown children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| and I've also had family related to drinking and driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| and basically it's like when you put your teenagers in your vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| I was the owner of the vehicle, and I paid the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| and although I tried to teach my children how to drive correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| and I thank God every day that we didn't have any incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| but the bottom line is it comes back, if your teenage driver gets out there and wrecks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| it comes back on the owner of the car and the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| which is, I'm saying the same with your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| I realize it wasn't you yourself that sold, it was your clerk, your employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| And as Mr. Brown said, you're going to have to invest by paying someone to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| if you're not going to be there a little more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| And so, ultimately, you own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| You're the one that's gotten the beer put there, the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| And so it is your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| And so you're the one responsible, just like parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| When children get out and misbehave under 18 or whatever, it's the parent's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| So I have to agree somehow, some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| And we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| You may be selling every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| That just happened to be that one time that the undercover went in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| and this guy supposedly got a call or a woman, and they still sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| So whatever, if you're responsible and you're the business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| you're going to have to figure out a way to make sure your businesses are being operated right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Sir, I'm going to give you an opportunity, last time, to address this board before we take our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:40| I mean, I would want you guys to take into consideration the position that we are in out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:49| The situation you've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| I don't think that I created it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I mean, as I said, we do have training procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| We train these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| We train them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We hire people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| And people quit us every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Our turnover in this industry is 400% and 500% nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| And we continue to do the best that we can possibly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| I mean, I can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I offer health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| I offer 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| I offer all these benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| I mean, we have benefit packages out there for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| And we're out there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| And we try to keep this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| I don't want to be standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| But I feel like, yes, there needs to be a stiffer penalty on the people that do it, that commit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| And, yes, it will affect my business if you close it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Motion on the floor is to suspend for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Do I have any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3254)|

| 0:55:44| This also occurred on 3-12-09 and basically sent an undercover in and bought alcohol, came out, and we went in and wrote a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3344)|
| 0:56:04| All right. Is the owner here or someone representing him? Do you agree with the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:15| Technically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| Technically. So you don't have a problem. Okay. We need you to state your name and address for the record. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3378)|

| 0:56:29| Thank you. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, I'd like to ask these two ladies, how long have you had this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| We got posted on the 11th day of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| That's what I thought. I remembered. It's not been that long since you were up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| You got a good start, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Well, you know, I'm glad I had a lot of money put away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| It looks like you're going to need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Uh-uh. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Make a motion to do you want to do the fine? Is that what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Actually, I'd like to speak on behalf of the other convenience store owners for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you. I've had my own business before. I opened my first business when I was 26, and it was a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:24| We didn't like college kids, so we really worked very, very hard to make sure that our clientele was older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| because we wanted to avoid things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| The day that, well, let me back up just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| The only underage ID that has been passed to our store in the two months that we've owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| has been to the underage cadet that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| The woman who took the ID had been hired the previous day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| She was not allowed to be on the register, but since she's been a customer in the store for 42 years, she wanted to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3476)|
| 0:58:06| So when we were really, really busy in training on the job, 16 and 18-hour days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:15| she took it upon herself to step into the register to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| She's 58 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| She came to me wanting a job because she had $268 a month in bills that she didn't want to put on her husband to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| She was happy to work for minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| She won't pay the fine because she can't, and I haven't asked her to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| I feel that there is a lack of understanding, and before being in the convenience store business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| it would have been very easy for me to sit up there and think the way that you guys think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| However, I have discovered in PAL, and specifically this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| we deal with a level of people that most of us, if we were raised middle class, don't ever come into contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| I suffer every day dealing with children, grandchildren, great-aunts and uncles, dads, mothers, grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:17| who are not only alcoholics but are drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| I have needles in my parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| I've already had to call the police twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I've had someone try to pass off a counterfeit $100 bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| I've had to call the police because someone was doing drugs in my bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| So it is not a lack of desire to placate and abide by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:49| I think it's a lack of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| And when you asked the gentleman earlier if he had any ideas about what we might do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| my suggestion, when we got busted, the 58-year-old woman started crying hysterically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| She's never had a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| She's never been out of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| And when she was asked by the cadet, when the cadet gave her the driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| she said to him, and I quote, she looked at the driver's license and said to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| I don't think you're old enough to buy this beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| And he said, well, yes, ma'am, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| And being the good country woman that she is, she's not going to tell a man no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| So she bagged it all up, and when she sent him out the door with it, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| now I hope you're not going to be drinking and driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| And he said, no, ma'am, I just live right over the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| It wasn't her desire to break the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| I think that when we went through the training for the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| we had every desire to uphold and have a successful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| I feel like having someone come in and do a sting after 11 days of business, we were well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| I mean, the woman that trained us did not specifically say that there would be a sting immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| but she certainly led us to believe that within the first 30 days we can anticipate them coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| Ma'am, if you could just try to wrap it up for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I don't have a problem paying the $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and I don't have a problem paying the $267 that this woman can't afford to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| However, what I would like to see happen is potentially not more training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| It has to be the seller's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| but we're underestimating the desire of the people that own convenience stores to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| We're not looking to create a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| And I just would like very much for people to understand that what happened that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| was extremely humiliating for this woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| and I don't think that that is the way that we want to treat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| So when we do a sting, if you're going to take my money because I broke the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| what I'd really like is for you guys to consider putting new businesses on a probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| And instead of sending someone in to bust us, we can look at it as a test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| and we can spend that $767, and we can all learn how to work together better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| It is not as simple as looking at a red line or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| There is so much more nuance to the situation than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I'll make a motion we do the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| I think you said that the $500 fine was rather than a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| That was okay with you, so I'm going to do the $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| I don't have any desire to lose my beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Okay, $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3795)|

| 1:05:40| I know we're running late, but we've got several of these on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| and we're not getting any reasons from the market side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| Maybe we need to take a second on each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Maybe there's a commonality here that we're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Who sold this and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| One of the employees misread the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| If they've got a strip on it, they don't have to read the date, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| Just didn't look at it close enough, did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| And now you're here before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| So you're going to take this a little more serious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Motion is $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Seven days, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3993)|

| 1:06:36| Big D, 6501 Maynardville Highway, Dan and Sean, Inc., owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:48| This also occurred on April 1, 2009 at the Big D market, 6501 Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| Undercover officer went in, bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| Is the owner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| My name is Rafiq Sumar, and Big D food store, 6501 Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| And do you agree with the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| And you want us to go ahead and proceed on today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| How long has it been since your first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| According to this report, Commissioner Brown, it looks like November 27 of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| so a little over six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I would like to correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| It happened in March, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Well, this one happened, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| March 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Well, I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| November, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| No offense was made on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| So five months later, you're back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Well, the fine was paid, according to this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| The fine was paid in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| In November, but you were caught in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| In February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| In February, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| So it took several months to even get to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| So I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| What was the circumstances here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| Actually, when the guy entered the store, the manager at that time, he shouted to the cashier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| please check the ID correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| That's what the manager told her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| And even though she made the mistake, she checked the ID, she missed the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Again, I say, dates don't matter if they got a strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| Sir, I'm sorry, I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| Did you witness the conversation where the guy ended up with his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Yes, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Well, and, you know, you have two within pretty much one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| She was a new employee, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Every month we hear new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| The detective just showed you, I think, a picture ID of what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| I also, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, well, the one thing you do then, and I'm not directing that at you, but to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| why don't you just have a picture, right and wrong, red strip, a big neon sign pointing to this red strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| You don't have to read the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| I've heard three or four times I misread the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| Forget about the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| The state has done that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| The state has done what they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Well, not what they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| They've gone above and beyond to create a new template.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| You don't have to worry about the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Red strip, inverted ID, no sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| It's basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| So, you know, you've gotten two in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| You have two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| And I sincerely hope they come every month, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| I hope there are 24 opportunities for you to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| That is really what I'm hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| So, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Okay, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Move for a $1,000 fine or 60 days suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Do I have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4225)|

| 1:10:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Kroger Store, 867-6939 Materville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| The Kroger Company owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| This also took place on April 1, 2009 at the Kroger's 6939 Materville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| Sent an undercover in and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| Item of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| All right, is the owner here or someone representing him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| If you'll give name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| My name is Greg Gaylor, store manager, Kroger 867-6939 Materville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| Okay, and do you agree with the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I do agree with the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| And do you want us to go ahead and proceed on today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| I would like to say that, just for the record, we have, that was my second week there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| We have since proceeded and trained to make sure that every single associate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| that is able to run a checkout has been TIP certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| And we do have a new policy in place that no one will be trained to run a checkout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| until they are TIP certified from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Greg, you just got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Where does he live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| They're in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| They're in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| No, Greg Gaylor is a fine, fine individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| You've been with Kroger's for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| What I want to ask is, Wolfie, you jumped this last person real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| You jumped up and put a picture and showed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Do you have something for Mr. Gaylor here, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Do you have a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And the reason I'm asking this is, Wolfie, it would sure help us at these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| if you could forward us the same picture that you've got for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| That way, when they're up here, we've got something right here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| This is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| But, Greg, I will make a motion then that says it's your first offense for the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| I'm assuming you want that versus shutting down the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Greg, does your office register have an override?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Did the employee have to override it when they scan it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| and it locks the register down and they have to hit override on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Actually, the register comes up with a prompt when alcohol is scanned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| and the cashier punched in the correct month and the correct day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| but they punched in the incorrect year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| So she does have an override if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| The motion on the floor is, since it's a first offense, $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4406)|

| 1:13:30| Texaco Food Mart, 7106 Manorville Highway, JIVI, Inc., owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4410)|

| 1:13:42| This also took place on 4-1-0-9 at the Texaco Food Mart, 7106 Manorville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:51| Undercover went in and bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4435)|

| 1:13:59| If you'll give name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| My name is Aziz Karani, Texaco Food Mart, 7106 Manorville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| and I am the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| And do you agree with the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4449)|

| 1:14:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Go ahead and proceed on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Make a motion to fine for the $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Is that what you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I have a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Do I have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Mr. Brown, did you have something you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| My usual question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| What was the circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Well, before we go any further, I want to declare that the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| Okay, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| What was the circumstances of the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I want to start off with saying that working at a gas station is not like working in the front line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| or rather fighting on the front lines of Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| And it just so happens to be that this particular clerk that sold this beer is from Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| And he will tell you that this is a blessing to be here in a gas station and not fighting in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| But, you know, just a very silly mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| I mean, he looked at it and just didn't realize it had the red stripe on it and made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| When you train your people, do you train them by the stripe or look at the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| Well, we actually send them to the class, which, you know, everybody's talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| And, you know, obviously that class covers the entire procedure, looking at the stripe, checking dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| You know, and we even have a system where you've got to put in the physical date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| and then hit enter and the register automatically calculates the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| However, you know, we do have an override switch, as Commissioner talked about just a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| What we have done now since that happened is we've changed the policy of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| to where nobody is to use the override period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| They've all got to put the date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| If they're caught not putting the date in, they're automatically going to be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Maybe we need to send a note to the school that's teaching this to start teaching the stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Update on the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Weigel's, 2729 Ellistown Road, Weigel Store, Inc., owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| I did get a call over the weekend from Mr. Weigel, but if you'd like to go ahead and inform us, update us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| It's Ken McMullen, Post Office Box 650, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| Obviously, we have put our construction on hold to the economy the way the economy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| We're waiting for, like everybody else in the retail business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| or everybody, I'm sure, is experienced in their business, if they're in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| that the slowdown in the economy certainly has hurt a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| Sales are soft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Right now, we're on a holding pattern on construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| That's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Also, talk to KUB and the sewers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| They're kind of on hold out there with the sewers, too, which naturally, when the sewers come, the homes come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| and then the people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| So right now, we're just on a holding pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| UK, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Not a thing, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| When I drove by, I noticed a sign, so I just wanted to get an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| So you'll be building when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Well, if I could tell you that, I'd be rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| I have a lot of crystal balls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| A lot of people will be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| But anyway, right now, I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| I'd be telling you a story if I did, and I just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Mr. Law Director, when we issue a beer permit, pending codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| how long do they have, and is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Is that just good forever, or is it good for a number of years that they can sit on a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| Your practice has been six months, and then after six months, it expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| So if it's another year or so before they build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| and actually have a store there and want to start selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| would they need to come back before this body and get another beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I might ask the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| I don't know if I've asked for a beer permit subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I don't have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| It's subject to final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| So if it's a subject to, does that change anything as far as how long the action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| let's say if we were to have taken it today, or I think we took this back several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| how long is that just open-ended, is it good forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| or is there a time frame that even a subject to runs out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| Well, I mean, technically, you could extend the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| I mean, without us extending, I mean, wouldn't it naturally just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| they would absolutely have to come back before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Your prior practice has been they basically die a natural death after six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| But we have extended them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| We have extended, and I'm not saying they should or shouldn't extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| I'm just asking that if it's another year or two down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| before Waggles decides to open up a store there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| if they might need to come back before this body to get that beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| Mr. Law Director, could we make a motion to approve subject to codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| Well, we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| I think that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| It's just a general question, how long even that do they have to take care of that subject to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:53| But if we make it subject to codes, and it depends on when codes finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| I'm still asking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| Is it 100 years from now too long or 10 years too long or two years too long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Ever how long it takes codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Does the law put a limit on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| You've imposed no such statute of limitations, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Just in terms of housekeeping and monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| you certainly want to ensure that these things do, in fact, get accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| It's not fair to the owner nor to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| if we don't at least have some kind of mechanism in place that we could monitor this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| to ensure that it is compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Is that something that we could work into the ordinance that we're getting ready to work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| Well, we can certainly put it on the application packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Yeah, I've got a question for Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Do you have property right now that you have beer permits inside the city that are not built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| I think, you know, as long as he renews his beer permit, we take $100 a year, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| and we collect from them on renewal of their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| Well, we haven't, according to the clerk, they don't even write this beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| so we're not even collecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Is that, according to the clerk, since it's subject to, we haven't issued it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| so we're not even getting the $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| I'm like Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| We go in and collect these $100 and pending the inspection once he builds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Well, maybe that's what we should start doing is go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| and start collecting the $100 annually in order to keep that subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| We will if we give a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| But we haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| I'd like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Well, first of all, I have to make sure that's property to make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| since that's not part of our agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Mr. Law Director, can we make that as part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| I think to be enforceable, we should wait on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| and we can find a better mechanism to ensure that we have a consistent program that's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| That might be something you might wish to add at next month's meeting, if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| commission meeting, to change either a resolution or change our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| Would that be something that Mr. McMillan would be willing to do, wait 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| we see if we can actually make this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Well, I don't know that there's anything he needs to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| But our law department's got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Well, I'm just saying that in the future, we might want to do something like you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| is to go ahead and issue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| How's my motion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Is it still standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4947)|

| 1:22:38| It's not on the agenda to make a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| If you wish to add that to the agenda today with a two-thirds vote, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| I'll make that motion that we add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=4968)|

| 1:24:31| and he can start selling beer at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5071)|

| 1:24:34| The regular fees it would take to update it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5074)|

| 1:24:56| And does that come due at a certain time every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| Well, you need to restate that motion, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5099)|

| 1:26:35| Have you or any of the employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5195)|

| 1:27:16| I don't own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5236)|

| 1:27:21| Okay, we'll get to that in a moment, but thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Is this application for on or off premises or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| And do you own or will you soon hope to own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5254)|

| 1:27:41| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| And then you'll likewise operate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5265)|

| 1:28:06| a conditional license, that if you do not close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| that license can be revoked and most likely will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I'll defer to the Board for questioning before we go to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5295)|

| 1:29:23| I just wanted to advise Mr. Adams to just be ready for a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5363)|

| 1:29:32| Yeah, I just wanted to say I'm going to vote for this because it's previously been on and off premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| but when you have a place that's both on and off premises in the same spot, you need to be extremely careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| I know what you've seen here today is people getting violations for selling to underage folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:55| but it's also a violation to sell to intoxicated folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| So you just need to watch real close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| and make sure you don't have patrons drinking close to their fill while they're at the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| and then taking beer with them and drink more than they should once they get in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5417)|

| 1:36:10| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| and people in the audience, I'd like to introduce you to my man of the cloth, Mr. Webby. Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| Webby from Fountain City United Methodist Church is going to come and speak to us just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| When Commissioner Smith asked me if I would do that this afternoon, he actually told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I had a couple of hours, and now you've said a few minutes. But I'll try to keep it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| an hour because I know you all have a pretty heavy agenda before you. I got here a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| minutes early and hadn't had the privilege to be downtown in a while, so I decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| walk down toward Market Square and was sitting there on the square just relaxing under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| tree and all of a sudden I felt something wet on my head. It's not too hard to feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| that with my head up here, and I thought, wow, it looks pretty sunny. I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| we were going to have a shower this afternoon. So I sat there a few more minutes and it happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| again. I thought, wow, this is strange. And then I realized as I looked up that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| not raindrops, but one of the native pigeons from the Market Square area was visiting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| me. And so I'm going to go to the city council meeting next time and see if they can do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| to eradicate those pigeons. But I also realized that we in East Tennessee are blessed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| fauna and flora. It's a beautiful part of the state in which to live. So I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| you all, how many of you, I'm going to ask for a vote. I know I probably don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| right to do this, Mr. Chair, but how many of you think that East Tennessee is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| part of the country in which to live? Amen. I thought we'd get a unanimous opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| that one. How many of you think Knox County is the best part of East Tennessee in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| to live? Okay, you've got two unanimous votes. There may be the only time of the day, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| I think we would all agree with that. We are blessed here in East Tennessee and particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| in Knox County with a beautiful part of God's creation. And I know we enjoy it in many different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| ways through the mountains, the lakes, and sometimes just sitting on Market Square. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| God has given us a great gift here, and God has commissioned us to care for this creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| to be good stewards of this beautiful gift. And we're called to do that in many different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| ways. And I want, as a private citizen, to thank you all for what you do to help to care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| for this part of East Tennessee and here in Knox County. I know you work hard, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| labor hard. You're eager to hear from your constituents, I know. And so as a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| citizen, I want to thank you for that. But I also want to give you a reminder of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| things you may already know. In our church, we're doing a study right now of a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| book entitled Three Simple Rules, a Way of Christian Living. And in this book, the writer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| talks about the fact that we are called to do three things, not do harm, to do good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| and to stay in love with God. And I think of all of us as private citizens, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| as those of you who are commissioners, would remember this as we go about our daily lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| that we would continue to make this part of the world a better place in which to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Again, we thank God for God's gifts, and I thank you for all that you do. Would you join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| me in a moment of prayer? Lord God, we thank you for the privilege we have of serving you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| in many different ways. For those of us who, many of us who work in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| of life, we give you thanks for the opportunity. For these public servants, we give you thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| for them, and pray your blessings upon them as they do this work, your work today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| in the future. We ask your help in all things, oh God. Amen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you, Jim. And next time, you feel free to bring the serpents with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Today we're going to be led in our pledge to the flag by Commissioner Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Please stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:22| All right, I'm going to ask, is there any amendments to the agenda? Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:32| Yes, we have the sheriff here and the attorney general here that want to speak on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| I'm wondering if we could schedule them second, right after these awards, so that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| get back to doing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| We can move that up right after we get, do you know the item number and page? Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| have that? It has to deal with the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Has to deal with the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Is it the one that Commissioner Harmon has proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| Commissioner Harmon's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Commissioner Harmon, do you know which number that is real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| That is 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| 914, so we'll hear 914 right after we get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| Honors and commemoratives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| Okay, all right. Clerk, if you'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Is this the proper time to pull something from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Pull resolution 501 off consent, please, just for a wording change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| Off of 501? So you just want to remove that and put it under just the regular items to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Three things, one of which has to do with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:51| Resolution item number 104, in consideration of the passing of Mr. Walker, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:59| see that taken up after 530 or before we break for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| So you'd like to hear that right prior to leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Also, I would like to, on behalf of commission, thank Mr. Franks at the library for a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:21| presentation of a dream that's being offered for the Knox County Library with things yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| to follow. Also, thank you for the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| And then one third thing that I'd like to thank people for is the great time that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| had in Knoxville over the last few days, the Dogwood Arts Festival, the Razzini Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| other things that have taken place in Knoxville over the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| As a country boy, I don't go to town much on Friday night, but the last few days in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| Knoxville have been great. I think that we owe a special thanks to the Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| their co-chairs, Maureen Bosch and Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Thank you. And I agree totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've been in touch with the state today and also I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| talking with Mark Jones. I'd like to add as a discussion item, he's supposed to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| a little later, Knox County is being very proactive on this swine flu thing and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| are some things that I think that the public needs to be aware of. We don't have any reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| cases here. This is not to inflame the situation or to make people nervous. However, I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| they need to be informed that our people are on top of it. So I'd like to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| as a discussion item when we get to the discussion phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| Clerk, if you'll make sure we have that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is this the proper time for postponements or is that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| If you'd like to do that now, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| I'd like to request to postpone R09-4-910. That was on consent. That's concerning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| Charter of the Audit Committee and discussions with the Law Director. There's some ambiguities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| and maybe discrepancies and some wording in there that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| You would prefer to defer that for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:16| 30 days? Hearing no objection, we'll defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| I was going to say if that's a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Okay, we'll just go ahead and do that unless I hear an objection. Hearing no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| we'll defer R09-910 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| R09-910 for 30 days. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| I need to move R103, I'm sorry, R102 to the first item on the agenda to get someone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| of here by right now. And R103, I need to postpone for 30 days. The Fulton basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:54| team couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| You want to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Hearing no objection, it's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Resolution 907, I'd like to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| 907?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| I don't remember what page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Page 13, and you want to defer that for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Yes, please, in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Hearing no objection, it's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I'd also like to withdraw Resolution 916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| You just want to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Hearing no objection, we'll withdraw 916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And I'd also like to defer Discussion Item 519 for 30 days, in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| 519? You wish to defer Item 919?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| No, 519.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| 519, I'm sorry. I don't have a 519.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| It's on, I'm sorry, it's online. It's on the Agenda Quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| It's the one about consolidating Intergovernmental and Finance Committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| Oh, that's a Discussion Item, it's the last, page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| I'd like to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| We'll defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6376)|

| 1:46:32| Commissioner Perales, did you have anything else your light's on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Okay, Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| I'm sorry, McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Wow, that was, well, I have Mr. Strickland on my mind because I wanted to say something about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| Well, that was, I guess, your soothsayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| I was going to tell Tank, good evening, good afternoon, well, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| And I'm sure he's watching. He's probably watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| And about 9 o'clock tonight, he'll be laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| But he may be laughing at us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| He may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| But get well, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| I'd like to pull items 905 and 906 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| And I'd like to move them as close to the front as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| They won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| But there's some people here that want to show their appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| So I'd like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| We'll hear that after we hear from the Sheriff and the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| We had already moved them up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Is that fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Any further amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Do I hear a motion to accept the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6466)|

| 1:47:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=6468)|

| 1:57:18| The Knox County Commission is proud of Olivia Spooner and proud to have this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| to honor her and her service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Olivia Spooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| Thank you. As you can tell, Olivia is a very busy young woman in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| She does a lot of stuff. In fact, she was just recently named to the Youth Health Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| and we'll be working with that next year through the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| So we're very proud of Olivia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| And I also have to say that she's one of the best babysitters in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| And we're lucky, I'm very lucky to have her as an influence on my two girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| So, Olivia, we're very, very proud of you, and we're so delighted to have you in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| Congratulations. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| Commissioners, we haven't voted yet, so all those in favor say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| Opposed? Ayes have it. Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| I might as well hang around for 1.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| For 1.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| We can do 1.05 real quick, and then we'll get into, is it 9.12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| 9.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| 9.14. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| By the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| By the sheriff. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| This is resolution 1.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| It's honoring the Knoxville Ice Bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| All those in favor say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Commissioner, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| Well, I think the resolution speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| These guys play some tremendous hockey, and for the second year in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| they have won both the regular season championship and the playoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| And they won the playoffs in quite dramatic fashion, showing their grit and determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| Three overtime victories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| I was there for one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| These guys have done our community proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| And the coach is here, and so is the general manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| and I think I'll let them speak very briefly while I do something silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:38| He always said when he grew up he wanted to be a hockey player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Thank you, Mayor Ragsdale and commission, for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| This is a great habit to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| My name is Mike Murim, the general manager and president for the Ice Bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| You know, it's an exciting ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| One of the toughest things in sports is to go back to back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| and to be here again this time last year and to be here again is an incredible feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| And I'm really, really proud of our coaching staff, especially our players, to persevere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| There was a lot of other cities out there that wanted to kick our butts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| and we're very, very happy that we stood up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| And I know I was very pleasantly surprised while we were sitting down that a lot of you came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:26| and said that you'd been to a number of the games and you hide up in the rafters so you're not recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| but we'll get an Ice Bear T-shirt on you guys and get you down there on the glass here next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| But we couldn't do it without the county support, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| And like I said, it's just a tremendous place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| I've been here 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Mr. Hillman, to my left here, has been here two, and he's brought four trophies to the city in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| So with that, I want to turn it over to our head coach, who's done an outstanding job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| and we hope he'll live here for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| I just want to say, on behalf of all the players and the rest of the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| that thank you very much for allowing us to be part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| We're certainly proud to wear Knoxville on our crest and try to support the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| and represent all of you in our community actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| We try to get out there and really be involved in as many areas as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| and we bring a lot of Canadians here, and they're only here six months at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| but we try to get out and represent this city and this county to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| And we're proud to bring these trophies here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| and Mike promises if we're back here next year so fortunate with these trophies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| he'll know that pledge of allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| Sir, if you'll just give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| I'm sorry, Scott Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| And my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| 5522 Golden Gate in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| And congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:14| Before we get into 914, since I'm sitting up here by myself today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| if there's an occasion that I need to step aside or if an emergency arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| we do need to have someone be our presiding officer in case I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| And I was going to nominate one of our committee chairs, Tony Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:35| just in case we need to have a different presiding officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| So I have a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| Tony, you can do it from up here or over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| It's your choice, wherever you feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| If you feel more comfortable, that will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7374)|
| 2:03:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| You hang on to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| The next item is resolution 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| It's on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| This is a resolution approving steps to be taken to reduce vehicle costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| and to improve vehicle efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Report to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Commissioner Pinkston, finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Six, two, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| In favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| And intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Voted eight, one, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| Motion to approve as amended by the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| And could you just state real quick what the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| The amendment was to delete the references to specific individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| and to simply state 28 and 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| Why does that not surprise me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| You know, in less than 24 hours, the mayor is going to present his budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| These vehicles may or may not be in the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| I just don't think it's appropriate for us to go ahead and rule on something like this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| when we haven't got the mayor's budget yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| especially with as close as that budget is to being presented to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| So I'm going to move that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| after we've all had a chance to look at the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| I have a second, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| I will be excusing myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| The clerk will note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| I believe a motion to defer is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| because the purpose of this entire resolution is to give guidance about the forthcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| So, you know, I'm sure the mayor has a good word processing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| If we present this resolution, if we vote in its favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| he can make some adjustments to his budget to reflect our will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| To do it after the fact, I think, is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| I think we need to spend a lot of time on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| and we've done a lot of hearings on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| and it's time to see where we stand and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| So I think a motion to defer is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Sheriff J.J. Jones or District Attorney Nichols, who would wish to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:38| Mr. Chairman, Randall E. Nichols, 8601 Dale Muir, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:49| You know, I don't come down here very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| although this commission funds about a third of the budget of the District Attorney's Office here in Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7552)|
| 2:06:03| The state, of course, funds the other two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| And I obviously come when any of the commissioners ask or have a matter that's on their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:12| that they think I could be helpful with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| And so over and above that, I stay in my office and do what I'm supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| and don't bother you people very much because you know where I am if you need my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:30| That's the one thing about this is that I've read I get an automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| And I don't know if you know, but I also get $4,999.49 a year from the county in the form of a stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:51| So the automobile and the stipend is, in fact, what is given over to me by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7611)|
| 2:07:00| in addition to paying a number of prosecutors my rent, some travel, some office expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| And I want to say, firstly, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| You have been good to me the last 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Whomever the mayor or the county executive have been, have been good to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| We've tried to be good stewards of your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| I've looked over the budget, and other than the state-mandated pay raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| that some of the prosecutors at my office, and not me, but some of the assistants get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| my budget has increased about 1.5% over the past four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| We have tried to be mindful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| I don't know the origin of the car and the stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| I'm told that it started with General Ron Webster back in 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| But I don't know the history of it as to why it's there and why it's continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:02| I've never inquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| And then I read that some feel that's inappropriate for the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| And that's my point, is I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| I've not had any commissioner to come and say, what do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| Why do you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| Why is it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| Do you need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| What's the problem here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| We're addressing an amended version of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| that no longer specifies that Mr. Nichols would be losing a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| So what is he speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Well, he's going to be given his five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| and then if you wish to pose a question to him, you'll be allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| You are aware of finance committee changes, so you're not specifically mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| I know that I was told that some names were taken out, but that was all I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| when I talked with the mayor and to try to figure out a way to present a reasonable budget from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| But while I'm here in the balance of my minutes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| if what we're hearing now, we want to talk about saving some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| then I'm here to ask, when do we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| We've been here, with the exception of Finbar Sanders and Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:22| the only two people that have ever talked to me in great detail about how we're spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| and what can we do to save it, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| And we had 1,112 people locked up at 8 o'clock this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:39| We know that between 25% and 30% are seriously mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| and we now know that we're spending in excess of $100,000 a day on this jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| You just built $15 million more, and we're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| So we're talking about three days of a full jail on what we're talking about saving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| and we need to get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| We've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| We've talked about the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| We've talked about a diversion center for the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| We've talked about using video cameras to save the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| So if we want to start talking in this community about saving money, then I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Let's start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Sheriff, did you wish to have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:40| ABN would be the best thing to start off with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| Jimmy Jones, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| A couple of things to talk about, some vehicle issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| First of all, we'll talk about Commissioner Harmon's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| and I will try to explain to you why that will not work at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| First of all, the employees at the Sheriff's Office are covered by the Knox County Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| The Knox County Merit System's rules and regulations say that any time compensation is decreased for an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:13| it must be by cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| So I cannot arbitrarily take a vehicle away from an employee that's considered compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| without re-incompensating them something for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| Plus, they would also have to be paid the mileage of what they've driven on their own personal vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| The second part in his proposal was to sell the vehicle to the employee, offer it for sale for blueprint value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| or put the vehicle up for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| Neither one of these under the procurement code follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| That is illegal on its face and cannot be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| So basically what we have, a colleague of mine, I can't take the claim for the saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| but it is the resolution is all show and no dough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| What I propose to do, along with the mayor, if you'll wait until tomorrow and listen to the mayor's address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:05| you'll see that I have drastically cut the number of vehicles that I will ask for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| Through dollars and cents savings that we will realize to be used to shore up the pension plan or any shortcomings we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:22| So if you'll hang on tomorrow, you'll see what the sheriff's office has done to try to alleviate the vehicle problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:30| The second topic I want to talk about is Commissioner Hammond has a vehicle policy guidelines before the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:41| Our vehicle policy is simple and precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| They can drive the vehicles for official use only and official sanctioned Knox County Sheriff's Office events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:56| That's it. Period. Two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| Official use only and officially sanctioned events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| If they live outside the 25 mile radius from the city county building, then they cannot drive their vehicle home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| They can drive it to a safe place that is designated a rural metro station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| It has to be approved by the sheriff to leave their vehicle parked there if they live outside the 25 mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:22| We have GPS systems on our vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| We already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| So some of the things you mentioned, I just want to make sure that you understood that we already have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| and we have that policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| First off, we've got Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| You mentioned the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| Can you tell me? I have it up here before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| What section are you referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Hugh Holt is who I'm referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| I asked him specifically if that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| He said absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| What section are you referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Because I've got the code right before me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| Basically, Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| The procurement code and the purchasing regulations addresses the disposition of real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| and personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Those vehicles are considered personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| Personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| There's real and personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| The personal property, there's different methods of disposal or disposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| Currently, we use govdeals.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| It's our online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| Could you just answer my question, which was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| what section of the procurement code prohibits disposing of them this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:43| Give me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| I'll pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| Okay, because I've got it right here and I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| All 19 pages of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| I didn't find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| It's described in more detail in the purchasing regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| which are incorporated or the codes incorporated as part of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| Just give me the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| I'm really interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Of course, it's a 70-page document, so give me just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| While he's searching for that, do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| Can you move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| So, Sheriff Jones, the merit system you describe as compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| that's your word for it, compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| You describe the vehicles as compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| So they have been given as compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| Sheriff, if you could please speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| What you must understand is I have given none of these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| All these people that are driving vehicles have driven vehicles for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Since I have been the sheriff, not one single extra vehicle has been given out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| So you legally classify them as compensation under the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| I think they're legally classified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| And if you'll look in the IRS documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| you'll see that they are classified as compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| Hugh, have you found the section you're referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| It's page 51 of the purchasing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| It is in section 9, subsection B, page 51, item number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:17| controls disposal of surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| Can you give me the wording because I don't see a ban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Surplus property is disposed through one of the following methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| Has it referenced that the county can dictate other methods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| I believe that same section it references that the county can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| through the legislative action of the county, dictate other methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| At my discretion, we can do negotiated sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| but I also have to have the approval of the mayor, the senior director of finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| and final approval of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| And, of course, this is just the third of three sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| As just a matter of fact, this section could be dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| and we could use the method that you're accustomed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| and we could still accomplish the goals of sections 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| Yes, I could sell these automobiles online to gov deals to these employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| but they would have to compete with the rest of the world on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| I just wanted to know, understand that this section could be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| with no great harm to the remaining portion of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| I'm in the car business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| Now is not a time to be liquidating cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| They wouldn't bring anywhere near what they're worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| The other thing I want to ask, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| I want to apologize to everyone whose name was mentioned personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| in the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| I believe that was in poor taste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| and though I didn't write it as a member of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| I want to officially apologize to the employees of the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:49| and the employees of the sheriff's office whose names were personally mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| I think that was in very poor taste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| And lastly, I want to ask that I know we're in a tight budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| but there are certain employees with certain departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| for instance, the Attorney General's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| where you have prosecutors driving automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| And if we could at all afford them, and I don't believe we have a single one now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| but if we could at all afford them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| I would like to see us start armoring the cars for the prosecutors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| because with the job that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| where they're the ones that are prosecuting cases against criminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| I think that we need to look in the future when we can afford to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| I think we need to look at getting some vehicles that are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| armored to help protect some of these prosecutors that are prosecuting these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| I'm sure General Nichols could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| His life has been threatened on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| Yes, I think, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| First of all, I want to applaud General Nichols for coming before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| and saying that he wants to start saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| And so I think during our budget hearings that we need to have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| And so I look forward to having those with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| and set aside adequate time where we can really delve into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| So I really appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| Secondly, Sheriff, thank you for your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| and thank you for clarifying your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Yes, I did present it to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| and that's why we've deferred it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| is he wants to take the current policies that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| any improvements that may be made, and bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| And I'm sure that the policy that you have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| will be one that he will look at to see that there's no duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| And if there's any opportunities to strengthen that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| I look forward to talking with you and working through that as he presents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| Also, thank you for saying that you are going to be cutting the number of vehicles in the budget tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| I look forward to hearing what the mayor has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| I guess that my also on the GPS, you said that you have GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| Now, if they're already on there, I would think that that's a matter of public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| and that we would be able to look at those GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| I'm sure that there's tracking devices there to show where the vehicles have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| The reason we have GPS on our patrol vehicles is for the 911 center to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| which vehicle is closest to the call to give out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| so we can have the quickest response time that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| So, yes, we have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| So it's on the take-home vehicles as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| It's on the marked patrol cars and some of the detective cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| Okay, but not, say, every take-home vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| I guess my whole thing on the whole vehicle is I know that when you start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| taking away something from somebody, it's not a pleasant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| But right now, Knox County, as I understand it, as far as the take-home vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| I'm not specifically talking about patrol cars, but I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| and not just in the Sheriff's Department, I'm talking about take-home cars in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| Knox County is providing the vehicle, the gasoline, the brake alignments, the oil changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| providing the insurance in case that there is an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| They are also providing, in some instances, car washes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| I've seen through the P-cards where these vehicles, people take them through car washes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| so we're paying to wash the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| And from what I understand, we haven't gotten the report back on the parking study yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| but I have seen a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| And in many instances on the take-home vehicles, we're also paying parking for a lot of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| So that's quite a perk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| That's quite a compensation in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| I believe we have to look at those and determine, is there a need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| And if there is a need, yes, people need these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| But if indeed we have too many, and if indeed we're washing their cars for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:51| and doing their oil changes and paying their parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| I just think that we've got to look at this and see if there are means of our cutting back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| and not having as many take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| And I believe that's fair for us to sit down and have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| And so with regards to paying mileage and these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| I think part of that discussion also needs to be, do we really need to have these people paying mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| or could we go to a carpool situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| Is there a pool environment that may be able to use for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| And so I think that these are discussions that we need to have as we look at this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| So I look forward to having those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| and I look forward to hearing the budget message tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| I think you'll be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| I think what we're trying to do here is run a micromanaging county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| And these people, the sheriff's elected, General Randy Nichols is elected just like I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| They're responsible for their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| They present their budget to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| We give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| They spend it the way they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| Now, are we going to tell them how they do it like we do the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| We give them their money and they spend it the way they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| I just don't think we're in a position to start micromanaging our county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| We just need to be sure that our money is spent properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| And I think these office holders are responsible for their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and their constituents just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| So I'm not in favor of any micromanaging government in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| I just like this isn't, and I would hope this is the same for the other 18 commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| In my opinion, this isn't personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| So somehow we've got to demystify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| And the way I'm thinking about it, it's not personal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| With that said, while I won't go so far as to say it was in poor taste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| it is very unfortunate that names were mentioned in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| And I do thank the Finance Committee and Commissioner Harmon for agreeing to take those names out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| And I think Commissioner Hammond is on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| What we need is a policy and a process, not necessarily, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| you give yours back and you get to keep your vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| But if we set the guidelines, and I think we're in a position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:18| I mean, we approved the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| So I think we need to set what guidelines are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:24| You know, as you calculate it out, if it's an on-call thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| and a lot of businesses and a lot of entities have gone through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| if you're called for whatever reason, health department, legal, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| if you're called 100 times in an average year and we're paying you 50 cents a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| and your round trip is 40 miles, you're talking about $2,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| So you have to balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| What is the need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| What is the process for it tipping the scale to where, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| it makes more sense for us to give you a vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| So that, in my opinion, needs to be the process that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| And I guess I'll say, you know, while I don't want to micromanage anything, things evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:16| The $6,000 discretionary fund that the commission has gotten, I don't know, since the beginning of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| now there are additional hooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| There are additional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| There's more accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| There's more paperwork that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| So as we evolve as a county and as economic times tend to go in a negative direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:34| you know, things have to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| And we have to have a greater oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| And this is just one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| You know, if someone asks me overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| and honestly I'm going to pull the sheriff out of this part of it because his situation is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| You know, they have a county to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| But in terms of the rest of the people, are there too many cars out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| There are too many cars out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| You know, again, I'm exempting the sheriff from that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| So what is the process for us to get that back under wraps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| Because, you know, having a vehicle because you make 50 runs a year, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| you live 20, 25 miles from the city county building just doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| So that's how hopefully this conversation will be geared more toward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| and take the more, you know, the personal edge off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| JJ, can you tell us about how many vehicles you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| when you say that we're going to find out tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| You know, the mayor has his address tomorrow, and I don't want to speak for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| but it's a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| And you will be able to realize a dollar and a cent number when we know that the bid price on these vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| are anywhere from $21,500 to $22,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| So if you multiply whatever this number is in reduction by $21,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| then that's the actual price savings you're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| Now, you said that these are considered part of these employees' compensation packages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| and that we can't take something away without replacing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| Well, without the vehicle away, we would have to come up with some kind of monetary replacement value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:25| to add to their salary yearly for that vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| plus pay them $0.50, $0.52 a mile for when they drive on official use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:35| And you've done that in this situation where you're taking these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| This is vehicles that I would have received next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:46| I am taking them off the top and will not receive X amount or number of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| So you're just removing the ones that were going to be removed anyway, but you're not adding any new ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| No, they weren't going to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| That would have been the number of vehicles that I would have received next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8882)|
