| 0:04:48| selected as the very first city to partner with the newly established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=288)|

| 0:05:18| initial discussions with community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| and we will build on that foundation for future efforts to reduce violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=321)|

| 0:11:37| we have some people who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=697)|
| 0:11:49| Okay, council members, we have five people signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| in favor of this and three signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| The rules are that it's only three. The rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| provide three aside. You can amend your rules as you well know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| as you do from time to time. This item, however, and we've had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| discussion before, I don't know if you remember or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| this is a quasi-judicial manner where it's important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| an appearance of fairness be conducted for the parties and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| allow five people on one side, you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| ought to allow five people on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| and there's been no notice in advance to the second side that one side is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| going to have five speakers. So in making a decision as to whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| not you want to amend the rules, it seems reasonable to take that into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| consideration as to whether to change the rules or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| whether to stick to the rules as they exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| and as they are published. And just as a reminder, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| the rules as they stand is three people for and they have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| five minutes each and three people in opposition they have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| each and then two minute rebuttal for the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Okay, any questions? Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| I was going to make a motion to suspend the rules. I just want to respect people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| coming down here. Okay, motion is made to suspend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| rules. I think, do you want to say you would allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| I would allow the extra speakers. Okay. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Motion has been made to suspend the rules to allow all five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| of those speakers to have signed up to speak. It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Council Member McKenzie. I don't know if we need to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| vote on that one. I'd like to also make another motion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| if there are people in the audience who did not have the opportunity to sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| that are on the other side. Okay, well let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| I guess let's vote on this first and then I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| yeah let's vote on on this allowing the people who signed up in advance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Can I ask a question to the motion on the floor? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Okay, so there's five signed up in favor of the appeal and how many signed up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| opposition to three? Three. Five and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, the motion on the floor is to let all five of Council Member Smith. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| want to clarify the motion that it was five speakers allowed for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Yes. Okay. Yes, that incorporates what you were saying, Glenn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to allow up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| five speakers per side for this item 10A. That motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Aye. Any opposed? Okay, the motion to suspend the rules as described carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Now we will move forward with hearing from the people who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| I'm sorry, Ms. McKenzie. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Could we also ask the other side if they could poll and see if they have two additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| speakers that would like to speak also? Okay. Mr. Mullins, Mr. Wendell, Mr. Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| if there are other people here, you have the option to add two people and you can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=920)|
| 0:15:30| I mean, you don't have to, but you have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=930)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you, Mayor. We would like to add Bo Jones and Wes Lee to our side for two additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| speakers to speak. Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Okay. So now we've got five and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| I think he'll say his name and address for the record when he starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Okay. Any other questions or discussion from Council before we go to hearing from the parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=958)|
| 0:16:08| Okay. Seeing none, the first person who signed up to speak in favor is Joe Holtquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Mr. Holtquist, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| you'll have up to five minutes. Joe Holtquist, 2240 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| As most Council members know, I served on this august body from the end of 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| December of 2001 through December of 2009. So I understand to a large degree what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| dealing with here and the difficulty in making some of these decisions that are hard calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| What I wanted to do tonight is give you some historical context. I think that'll be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| I'm not the only speaker and I think I'm going to trust that we have excellent speakers to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| particulars about the current situation, but I think the historical context and the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| history, if you will, is very important. So when I was on Council, I began early on to advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1023)|
| 0:17:12| south waterfront planning and when subsequently he became mayor and then governor, but when Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1032)|
| 0:17:21| Haslam was not mayor yet, was running for mayor, he met with me at one point and asked me the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| question that I guess he asked everybody, what's the number one thing for you? And I said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| that's easy. For the district I represent, the first district, it's the one that has the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| potential and that's the south waterfront. So I went on to describe what I thought the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| was and sort of tried to paint a vision for what it could be. Fast forward, he said, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| a great idea. I'd like to, if I'm elected, I'd like to try to move it forward. So as things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| progressed, after he took the mayoral position, he actually decided it was a high enough priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| to create a separate department. The South Waterfront Redevelopment Department, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| was the title. He hired a cabinet level senior director, a man named Dave Hill, a smart guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1090)|
| 0:18:19| capable guy, to head that department. And we worked in a process, and I think others are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| going to describe that, so I won't go into that, but it was a wonderful process, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| real partnership between people in the community coming at it from different angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| homeowners, potential developers, landowners, et cetera, other people in the community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| were just passionate about it, city staff, planning staff, and a great consulting team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| And so we put together the plans. Most of you have probably seen something about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| even though they're somewhat aged now. The vision plan and the implementation plan, both in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1137)|
| 0:19:06| and the regulating plan, which is the form-based code that will be discussed tonight in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| And I will say, parenthetically, that one of the things that we said at that point was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| that we're going to revisit this, particularly the regulating plan, the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| hopefully in a year. Well, when I went off council, it still hadn't happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| and there have been some tweaks to it, but it's been mostly driven by the administrative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| So there really hasn't been a broad public effort to revisit the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| to this day, and here we are, what, 14 years later. And I'm not pointing fingers at anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| but I'm just saying that not only is it something that I think was a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| I think it's an even better idea today. So that's a sidebar, but I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| to understand, and again, you're going to hear from others, the particulars on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| people who have been very, very involved for a long time in South Waterfront planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1204)|

| 0:20:26| et cetera, and the form-based code. I was the one that advocated for form-based code initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| but then the consultants, everybody else got, you know, soon my voice was just one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| And so it gives us the opportunity to make the best of a jewel. Urban waterfront is so special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1238)|
| 0:20:49| and so unique, and cities that have taken the greatest advantage of their urban waterfronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| have transformed their cities. And I always believed that that was possible here, and I still believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| that today. I think we've taken some very, very positive steps in that direction, but we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| challenges. And if you have form-based code, it's there for a reason, and you're going to hear more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1267)|

| 0:22:22| Our issue is not with the developer. It's with the administrative decision to send this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| through a Level 2 rather than a Level 3 review. This is what we are appealing, and we are joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1347)|

| 0:32:21| it. The odds are slim to none that anybody will propose a high-quality innovative development for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| one of those uses. It makes no sense to lay out a review process limited to only prohibited uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| and I can assure you that the seven community members who served on the oversight committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| would never have supported such an interpretation. We have asked for the date this interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| was made and a copy of the decision documenting it, but we have not yet received that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| During the second BCA meeting, prohibited uses were not mentioned. The second interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| that was offered was that level three was for proposals that had gone through a level two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| review and failed to get needed variances, but there's nothing in the code that lays out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| progression. A bit of history. Four years ago, a project was proposed, much like this one, for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| use that was not prohibited but with significant deviations from the code. The city discussed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| level three review with the developer. All parties agreed that the proposal would get a level three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| review, and the item was placed on planning commission agenda. So at that point, city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| clearly shared our interpretation of level three review. So it does seem like that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2013)|
| 0:33:43| interpretation of level three is a bit of a moving target. Finally, to zoom out a bit, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| mention that the code requires the form administrator to identify key issues in a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| and suggest possible modifications. This kind of negotiation has certainly happened on other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| waterfront projects. It does not seem to have happened on this one. As far as we can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| the city did not suggest modifications. They simply identified the variances that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| needed and sent the developer to BZA. A bit more negotiation on the front end might have saved us all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| a lot of time and effort on the back end. This code represents what city administration, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| community, and city council wanted for the south waterfront. It is up to all of us to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| these standards are met in order for the vision to be realized. Respectfully, we ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| uphold our appeal and require a level three review. And I'll close by saying that whatever the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| tonight, we appreciate your thoughtful consideration and we appreciate your service on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2089)|

| 0:35:17| was a joint effort between the city and the community to guide future developments in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| area to a more urban walkable setting with mixed use developments and community access to a scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2121)|

| 0:36:44| community? Not only that, we are surrounded by parkland. If we put our minds to it, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| connect Vestal to Iams via interconnected greenways, parks, and community hubs. People from all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| south Knoxville have a stake in the waterfront. This is evident by the letters of support you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| have received from the community as well as the presence of those who have joined us in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| None of my neighbors had any idea that there were concrete plans for a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2224)|

| 0:37:14| Had I known, I could 100% guarantee you that the BZA would have gotten my feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Councilman Tommy Smith can attest to this. I bugged him plenty enough about the stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| in the old city when that was coming for a vote. Only once I joined this appeal did I hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| there had been a sign posted at one point. I was told it fell down and nobody put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2249)|

| 0:37:44| by the city and the community in the South Waterfront Form Code. As such, they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| have undergone a level 3 design review. I understand it may be uncomfortable to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| this project back and put it through a level 3 review process, but just because something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| is difficult doesn't give us an excuse not to do the right thing. It may be that we as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| can make compromises with the developers. As the people most directly affected by this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| we deserve that opportunity. This decision you make today will set a precedent for how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| as a city and as a community, will address future developments in Knoxville. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you. Now moving on to the people in opposition to this appeal, starting with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| Benjamin Mullins. Please state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2303)|

| 0:38:36| And I just want to start off by saying we appreciate everybody that's come out that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| a very keen interest in the South Waterfront District and all the work that went into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| form-based code district. My clients share that interest and I appreciate Ms. Toker saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| we did everything right because we did. We followed the ordinance exactly to the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| the way it's supposed to be followed. Where we diverge in our opinions, however, is we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| that Mr. Ahrens and the codes administrator also followed the ordinance exactly the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| it is set out. And if I can put on my professor hat for a second, when you're interpreting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| zoning ordinance, you have to look at all the parts of the ordinance, not just one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| And the only section that they've referred to is the policy section under the Level 3 review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| what it's intended to. But before we get there, you have to go through the Level 2 process. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| you look at your zoning ordinance, and I have copies if anybody needs that, and it was part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| of the submissions that I emailed out earlier as well. Mr. Mullins, could you just move the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| mic a little closer to you? Oh, I'm sorry. That's good. I usually don't have a problem people hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| me. Excuse me. Level 2 development plan review starts out to ensure that all multi-dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| mixed-use structures comply with the requirements of the applicable form district. So this, being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| a multi-dwelling, has to start out going through the Level 2 process. There is no other choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| As you move through the form-based code, you get to 702F8, which is administrative deviations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2406)|
| 0:40:15| which gives the authority for the administrator to, there's permitted deviations, which are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| minimum deviations for setbacks, Bill 2 zones, and the like, up to certain small percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| And then you get to Level Part C, which says unlisted standards, which says, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| to quote its entirety, any request for relief from a required standard other than those listed above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| which is those minimum standards I just referred to, must be reviewed pursuant to Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Section 2, City of Knoxville Board of Zoning Appeals. Slight typo here. This form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| was not revised when recode was revised. Article 7, Section 2 refers to the old standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| the old part of the zoning ordinance, which was for the BZA appeals. It's now Section 16.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| But this makes clear that if you don't meet the requirements, you have to, you must be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| under the BZA. There's no option to that. It says you have to go through it, must. It's a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| So we had to go to the BZA to seek variances for the things that we asked for, the height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| the setbacks, and the like. When you go to the BZA, there's very stringent, difficult standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| overcome. You have to show a hardship, a legal hardship, based upon environmental constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| to the property that aren't, you know, general to the area as a whole, but are specific to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| piece of property. We were able to demonstrate that to the BZA. They approved our variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| unanimously. But it's important to note that before we went to the BZA, we reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Ms. Sharp with the Office of Neighborhood Empowerment and asked, who do we need to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| in the neighborhood about this request before we go to the BZA? And she directed us to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| CityView Property Owners Association. And we did have, we had two meetings that Ms. Mallard was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| present. We had one before the BZA where we talked about our variances and what we intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| to do and our justifications for it. And then we went to the general membership, Mr. Jones did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I didn't make that meeting, to the general membership after the variances had been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| But again, the progression of the zoning ordinance is clear. You have to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| BZA. If you are not eligible for, you can't meet the hardship standards, then if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2545)|
| 0:42:34| Section 7.02G3, this is in the Level 3 review, it says the applicability of Level 3. It states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| in its entirety, any development that does not meet the requirements of Section 7.02E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| which is Level 1 review, or 7.02F, Level 2 review, or Article 7, the BZA variance, now Article 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2567)|
| 0:42:57| may submit an application for alternative compliance review. You have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| The ordinance in its progression, following the rules mandate that we go through that progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| I did not have time to talk about vested rights, but the appeal wasn't granted. There was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| appeal. Fifteen days became final. Under Title 13, under Article 15 of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| our rights are vested, and even if this were to agree with the interpretation, it can't be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| retroactively. We are entitled to move forward with this project, so respectfully I ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| you deny the request. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next person is Keith Wendel. Mr. Wendel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| and you'll have up to five minutes. Good evening. My name is Keith Wendel. My address is 3717| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| Wimbledon Lane, Birmingham, Alabama. I'm coming here tonight to speak to you from the perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| of the developer of this project, but I guess before I get into what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| I want to just point out something that Ms. Toker said earlier. She said, you know, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| she's not appealing the variances, and this is not about the variances that were granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| but it really is. That's exactly what this is about. This appeal is a, you know, all I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2655)|
| 0:44:24| the best phrase I can come up with is a backdoor way to overturn variances for which the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| period has already expired. As a developer, we go and we came into the city, we review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2671)|
| 0:44:41| all of the requirements to have our project approved, zoning approvals, any other city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| approvals. We study that process, and we follow that process, and in this case, we did follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| that process. We, even to the point of applying for the needed variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2693)|
| 0:45:03| attending the BZA hearing at which no one voiced any opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| allowing the appeals period for those variances to expire. So we followed the process completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| and at that time, you know, and this is the process that's clearly set forth in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| I want to make that clear. This is not an arbitrary process. This process is set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| in the code, and we followed that, and at the time that appeals period for the variances expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| our rights vested, and at that time, that's when we feel the certainty to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2737)|
| 0:45:46| with the project. That's when we start spending money, start taking other actions we need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| to move forward in the development, and in this case, in fact, we spent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| about $1.8 million in moving forward on this project to this point in relying on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| the understanding that our rights were vested and that there was no way for those rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| to be revoked at a later date, and, you know, if this type of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| in-the-round appeal is permitted, it basically creates a situation where neither we nor any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| other developer, if this type of appeal is permitted, we can never have any certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| So, in this case, the appeal occurred several months after our rights vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| but that appeal could have happened a year down the road when our project was halfway built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| two years down the road when it's built and operating. There's no end for when this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| of appeal could have occurred if this is permitted, and, you know, I think for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| you know, I just can't imagine a code would allow this, and so, you know, that's just the thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| want to emphasize. We, you know, a process set forth in code has to, at some point, provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| certainty. Also, you probably have heard a lot about allegations of a lack of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| and Ben mentioned this earlier. We reached out. We had meetings both before the BZA meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| after the variances were granted, we had meetings. We met with the CityView| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Homeowners Association Board, and again with the CityView, we attended the monthly meeting of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| CityView Homeowners Association. We presented the information on our variances. We answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| questions. We even made changes to our plans based on suggestions submitted at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Now, the timing is important because that happened before the appeals period expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| but yet no appeals were filed, and so really, I guess just in closing, I just want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2883)|
| 0:48:15| that this type of appeal would make development not just on the South Waterfront District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| but anywhere in Knoxville, would make development really unworkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| because of the lack of certainty. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| Thank you. Next person signed up is Jason Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| Mr. Bailey, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| Good evening. Jason Bailey, 3317 Overbrook Road, Birmingham, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| Thank all of you for having us. I'm trying not to be repetitive as my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| There was a little bit of overlap in what we're going to say, so I'm going to try to limit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| as much as possible. As Mr. Mullins pointed out, the proper process wasn't only followed by us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| but it was also followed by Mr. Aarons and the Planning and Zoning Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Mr. Aarons and the Planning and Zoning Commission. As my colleague mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| there was plenty of transparency in this process. We reached out. We went above and beyond what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| actually required by the ordinances to contact everyone, so I don't want there to be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| misinformation about what or was not done. There's really two options here. One is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| deny the appeal, and that would respect the vested rights that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| It would support the group that followed the process, including Mr. Aarons. It would provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| certainty to the ordinances that are already in place, and it would support those who have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| a substantial investment into your city. If you grant the appeal, this would incentivize those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| who chose to sit on the sidelines during this process but later wanted to change their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| about what this development should and shouldn't be. In addition, if the appeal is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| it would put us in the unenviable position that we would have to somehow recoup our investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| that we've already made here, which, as my colleague Keith pointed out, is very substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| at this point. The appellants claimed that a Level 3 review was required, but as Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| pointed out, it isn't really a matter of interpretation of the code. The code is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| very clear as to this point. You have an option to go through a Level 3 review if it is a prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| use. If it's not a prohibited use, there's also an alternative way that it can get to a Level 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| review if that's truly what the appellants wanted. As Mr. Mullins pointed out, if it's a prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3041)|
| 0:50:51| use, it automatically gets to a Level 3 review. However, if it's not a prohibited use, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| goes to the BZA as a matter of right. At that point in time, the appellants could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| participated in the very public process, and they could have shown up and said, we object to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| and almost with certainty, the BZA would have denied our request for the appeal, and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| have most certainly gone to a Level 3 review. There was an additional 14-day period following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| that when they could have also filed an appeal of the BZA's previous order, and it most certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| at that time would have gone to a Level 3 review as well. So it's a very compelling argument that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| we did everything we were supposed to do, Mr. Aarons did everything he was supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| and yet we are going to be subjected to the risk that our development doesn't go through as planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| because certain individuals chose to sit on the sidelines and not involve themselves in a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| public process. So as Keith started to hint on, I don't know what kind of message this would send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| to any kind of developer, any individual, any business that wants to make an investment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| your fine city, but I can almost guarantee you that nobody's going to do that if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| likelihood later on that you're going to grant entitlements to these individuals and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| only to jerk them back later because somebody doesn't like something that they didn't involve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| themselves in sooner. So we start talking about precedents here, and the precedent is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| something may or could, should have, in the view of some other people, gone to a Level 3 review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| despite them sitting on their hands and not involving themselves in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| or the risk that developers, business people are going to spend millions in your city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| only to have them jerk back later. The real issue there is if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| nobody will make an investment in the city if they can later be put at risk and jerk back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| So Ms. Toker and several of the other individuals mentioned that they don't object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| to our project, and that's great. There's a way you can fix this. If the precedent or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| concern is that future developers won't, this won't happen again, you can take legislative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| to fix it and let our project, who's already earned its vested rights, go through. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| no problem with that. They said they don't have a problem with our development. If that's truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| the case, then there shouldn't be an issue here, and it can be fixed quickly after we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| That shouldn't involve us in that process. So, you know, there's a reason the BZA unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| denied their appeal before, and that's because of the transparency that we provided in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| and the ordinances were followed to a T. Thank you. Thank you. Next person is Bo Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3227)|
| 0:53:59| Is Mr. Jones going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| I just relinquish my right. Okay. How about Wes Lee? I'll relinquish mine as well. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| Council members, that concludes the people who wish to speak or who signed up and you've allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| to speak on this event. Now we have a two-minute rebuttal by the people who are for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3255)|
| 0:54:24| I had a bit of trouble hearing, so if I heard something wrong, please excuse me. A couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3264)|
| 0:54:35| things. Again, our quarrel is not with the developer, except for maybe the fact that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3275)|
| 0:54:45| submitted a proposal that was badly misaligned with the code, but we are not here to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| the variances that BZA approved. Our position is that this proposal should never have gotten to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| BZA, that it should have been treated as a level three because it is so out of line with the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| and gone through the level three process, which meant it would not have gone to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| it would have gone to the Planning Commission with an opportunity for public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3313)|
| 0:55:23| There is nothing in the code that says there is a progression that if you go through a level two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| review, then you do a level three review. Nothing. There's absolutely nothing in the code that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| those two things are a progression of one another. Prohibited uses, again, if we wanted level three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3337)|
| 0:55:49| to be only for prohibited uses, when we wrote the code, we would have said level three review is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| prohibited uses. That's not what the code says. It doesn't mention prohibited uses regarding level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| three review. I think I heard something in there about deadlines. There is no deadline for appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3364)|
| 0:56:14| this kind of administrative decision. I agree it would have been nice if we had done it sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| but there is no deadline in the code for this appeal, so it is a perfectly proper appeal before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| Thanks. Thank you. Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| No, they don't get a rebuttal. It's just the one side that does. Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you, Mayor. This is pretty complex, so it may need more than five minutes, so I'll ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| a little bit of grace at some point from my colleagues, but I want to reiterate the thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| for everybody that's come out and spoke tonight, the developer for being willing to invest in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| community, the people that have dedicated themselves to understand this South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| code and why it's special. I support the development of this property. I think as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| as it's within the code, anybody should be able to do whatever they want with the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| they have, but when you ask for deviation, I think you open yourself, rightly so, to public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| so that's why we're here. I do want to ask Mr. Ahrens if he could come forward. I have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| questions. Hi. Level 2 and level 3 description only give us about two sentences each in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3443)|
| 0:57:37| to describe what they're intended for, and so I think it's only fair, given you're the administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| in this circumstance, can you express your interpretation of the level 3 description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| and what it's for? Sure. And I don't think it's an opinion. The purpose is a... You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| just move the mic really close to you. Thanks. It might not be plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3478)|
| 0:58:12| We can hear you. Okay. So level 3, the purpose of level 3 alternative compliance review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| alternative compliance review is intended to allow innovative high-quality developments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| would not otherwise be allowed under strict interpretation of the form district regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| but nevertheless comply with the intent of the applicable form district and plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| The alternative compliance review mechanism is also intended to provide a process for requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| by applicants for reconstruction or expansion of non-conforming structures in which non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| uses operate. So as I read that, it's tough to jump to that section without understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3526)|
| 0:59:00| level 2 development plan, because level 2 development plan is intended to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3540)|
| 0:59:08| all multi-family, multi-dwelling, and mixed-use and non-residential structures comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| requirements of the applicable form district. It says in the applicability section, 702F2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| applicability, except for houses and duplexes on individual lots, all new construction or expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| of an existing structure or building is subject to development plan review process. It says all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| it. And so, again, as Mr. Sorry. Mullins. Yeah, Mullins. There's a process. And 702F8C, straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3574)|
| 0:59:54| out of the code, says any request for relief from required standards other than those limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| deviations above must be reviewed pursuant to Article 16 of the City of Knoxville Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Zoning Appeals. So as I read that, and I'm trying to think of examples that would be required to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| to the alternative compliance, Stanley's down in South Knoxville. Everybody loves Stanley's. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| they want to move up into the south waterfront, they have to go through the alternative compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| because they're a nursery. They're growing crops. That's considered major ag. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| Sorry, time limited. I just want to, if I can. The other question I had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| there's a vesting conversation is pretty complex, but I think it's fair to say that from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| administrative review committee, you officially approved the development plan when you approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| the development plan. Is that right? That's correct. And can you tell me when that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| approved? That was approved 15 days after the Board of Zoning Appeals approved their variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| I believe it was approved in August. The development plan, the administrative review plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| I think as Mr. Mullins submitted to us, I think it was approved later on in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| Is that not right? Yeah, I think Mr. Mullins submitted a document that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| in August 23rd, the project's development plan received final ARC approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3683)|
| 1:01:33| Yeah, they start with us. There was variances that were identified. It went to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| There's an appeal process. Once that expired, that's when we approved the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| the ARC. As I understand it from the ARC and submitted by Mr. Mullins himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| this project plan was approved finally by ARC on August 23rd. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| So, and I would ask one more question, maybe a little bit of leniency on the time if I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| from the appellant. I have a lot more questions, but we'll start with that. Ms. Toker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| Mr. Smith, I think, let me just go to Ms. Rider and then I'll come back to you in just a sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Would you prefer that I do it that way? I was also going to suggest that we make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| give Councilman Smith more time. I think he's been knee deep in this for months. Why don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| you make a motion for a specific amount of time? I'd like to give Councilman Smith five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| additional time for questions. Okay, motion's been made. Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| Any questions or discussion? All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you. Sorry, is there a follow-up? I can provide some context here. After the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3756)|
| 1:02:45| Zoning Appeals, they were still working on a lighting plan, and once that lighting plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| submitted and approved, then we approved the development plan. Thank you. That's the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| Thank you. August 23rd was when the ARC plan was finally approved. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| You're asking me? Yes. It's not a trick question. We've kind of covered it. August 23rd is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| the development plan was approved. So I have a question for the appellant at this moment. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| you. When was the appeal filed? I believe it was August 8th. August 8th. So I think there's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3787)|
| 1:03:19| lot of discussion about investment that's been made, when vesting happens, and when it's too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| late, and the fear for lack of development or uncertainty. I think that this appeal, however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| we may feel about the code and its unending timeframe for when you can appeal, this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| it seems, was filed before the Administrative Review Plan was approved. So in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| there's plenty of time for this discussion and this body to provide oversight for this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| I'd also like to ask Mr. Frost for a minute a few clarifying questions. This Council has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| voted on this type of appeal before, so we're all new here in this. This appeal is about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| administrative decision regarding whether this development should have been level 2 or level 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Is that correct? I believe so. It's not about whether the development followed the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| of the code associated with level 2? I think it's an appeal of a determination of Mr. Ahrens whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| this should have gone through a level 2 or a level 3 review. Right. But we've had a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| and I want to clarify what it's not about. So this is not about whether the developer followed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| appropriate process in the code, is that correct? I don't believe that was appealed. And it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| about specific variances that BZA has heard and voted on? Those have already passed. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| Okay. So I think that's important because there's a lot to this and if I may go on just for a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| more minutes. I've studied this at length and I think that it's very complex and so you can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| it very complex or very simple. And I think that the simple version is that there's discretion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| And I think that's very important. The code inherently has discretion built into it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| provides the administrator discretion to make his decision and it provides this body the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| to review things that we think apply as a level 3. I think that this appeal is right and I'll list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| a few reasons why and maybe unpack those later after I have some of my colleagues weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| One is that the South Waterfront Code is clear that the size and scope of this development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| not what is intended. So when you think about 2007, a community weighs in, structures a code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| it calls out specific words to follow. And where there's not specific words to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| there's discretion. And that means this body gets that as well as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| And that allows for number two, which is this form-based code inherently provides flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| for discretion of the administrator and this body between level 2 and level 3. The administrator can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| make a decision about level 2 or level 3. To a certain extent, it sounds like the developer has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| the option to apply for level 2 or level 3. There's only a few sentences to go on. And so I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| for whatever happens here, we need to amend this code as I've advocated for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| The third reason is when a development is misaligned with the intent of a code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| we should listen to the people who crafted it. This is not a code that was developed 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| ago. It was not developed 50 years ago. The people who put their blood, sweat, and tears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| into it are here and I feel like have articulated very clearly what the desire of the code was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| And the fourth is sending this level through the level 3 process is actually a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| It's authorized in the code. It allows for planning commission's input and it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| deny the developer a path to continue. You can still develop the land. You can still advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| for this specific plan. But this type of thing is so complex and so beyond the strict interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| as outlined in level 3 that I think it requires planning commission's input. There are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| elements of this that are 100% more than what the zoning called for. So it's not the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| variances. Again, as a reminder, that's not what we're considering. But the sum total of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| development as it relates to what was intended based off the code, our discretion, and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| authors of that code have outlined for here is so significant that there's an extra step that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| think that this development should go through. I hope you develop in the South Waterfront. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| think this one needs more eyes on it and particularly the expertise of the planning commission. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| have quite a bit more to cover, but I'll pause and take a deep breath and thank you for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| council members allowing me to go a little long there. Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| Law Director Swanson wanted to add some clarifications. Yeah, I need to add a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| clarification to your comments because number one, I think you're exactly right. I think the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| is right. The appeal is not the appeal of the variances. The appeal is the appeal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| administrator's interpretation of the code. But the question is, did he read the code properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4091)|
| 1:08:21| Not did he read the code the way he wants the code to read or the way he believes the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| should read, but did he read it the way it is actually printed? And that's not based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| necessarily what a vision plan is. That's based on how it is, in fact, actually printed. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| did he read what was there and did he read it correctly and did he interpret it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And that's what the appeal is. So, it's not a question of how you believe the code should read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| It's a question of how the code does read. Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Okay, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| Swanson, really quickly, your words that just came out of your mouth, the appeal is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| Are you saying it's worded correct? I said it is ripe. Okay, okay. I was like, hold on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| It is correct for it to be heard. Okay, thank you for clarifying. I didn't hear you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Okay, so many things to say. So, one thing is I have a packet of the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| and the form-based code and you guys have read many of the highlighted portions. Real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| I want to say, let's see, I don't know, under number seven in the part for level two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4169)|
| 1:09:39| Mr. Mullins pointed out for unlisted standards, it says any request for relief from a required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| standard other than those listed above must be reviewed pursuant to Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Section 2, and that's actually Article 16.3. I bet if you go review the tapes, we actually made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| motions to correct those even though we didn't change the form-based code. So, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| why that's still in there. I just want to put that on the record tonight. I don't know if Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Roberto has that memory or not, but I know we talked about that in the many hours till 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| of recode, so that should be corrected. So, maybe we can get that on a future agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| and take care of it correctly, correctly. Yeah, so I have a lot of notes here. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| I want to talk for a minute about vested rights because I think we're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| interpretation and the appeal is of the interpretation and the interpretation can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| only go based on what the code actually says, not what people think it says or what the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| says or what we want it to say. Before we get into that, and I'm going to run out of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| have to have people come back to me, Mr. Swanson, can we talk about the vested rights because I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| little concerned about that because we are talking about decision of staff of code that we legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| because that's all they can do is decide based on the words we send in the legislative record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| and now we have a development project stuck with potentially with vested rights. So, can you talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| about the vested rights and I'm a little confused about the August timeline because that's news to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| me, but the the BZA hearing was heard and approved unanimously May 2022. Sure, and what you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| asking me is with regard to the vested rights with respect to the variances essentially because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| that's what they received. They received a number of variances. Frankly, I don't recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| how many variances they received, but generally what the state has compelled us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4293)|
| 1:11:43| is to recognize vested rights when folks have received authorization under a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| and, for example, in this case gone and got variances, received those variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| those variances then do not get appealed or do not get successfully appealed and then they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| got to spend money to move the project forward and when that happens the state law says they then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4325)|
| 1:12:14| incur invested rights which we cannot impair and if we do impair then we subject the city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| liability and various and sundry other bad things. How does the August date tie to when did their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| vested rights begin? The BZA variances were approved in May and the appeal period for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| ran out ballpark April 1, so. The vested rights would incur once they are authorized under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4356)|
| 1:12:48| law to proceed forward. Which was May, April, or August? I'm not able to tell you the answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| that question. Okay. Because I have not researched it. But it's definitively done. They have vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| rights. I'm not going to tell you that either. Certainly they have suggested they have vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| rights and it may be that they have vested rights but I'm not going to give you an opinion. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| you folks may vote in a way that requires them to prove that they have vested rights and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| make them prove that they have vested rights but if they do we will recognize those vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Okay. The developer, I'm going to get my question. I probably won't have time for you guys to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| answer. One of the comments made was who did you meet with during the BZA appeals window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| You said you met with people during the BZA appeals window. Who and what was discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Yes, Councilwoman. We met with the City View Association twice. We met with them on May 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| before and then we met with their board on Zoom and then we met with them on I believe May 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| 27th. But it was within the 15-day appeal period that would have expired on June 1st. We reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| out to them to have this meeting. They said, well, our normal meeting is May 25th. There's emails in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| the packet. I have a stack of emails. All emails going back and forth. Everything to show this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| what we did, the process we followed. We said, no, we need to meet with you before the 17th because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| we have these variances. We want to discuss these variances with you, our justification for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| answer any questions, talk about the project, talk about the road improvements we're doing to West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| Blount. Everything, talk about extending the Greenway, everything that we wanted to do. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| had that meeting in May. Then we had, they said, will you still come back and have a meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| the general membership? How many people attended the meeting? Mr. Jones, you attended the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| one. The first one was six or seven board members. Actually, Mr. Frost can verify this. Somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| invited council member Smith to it. He rightfully declined because you're not supposed to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| meetings like that. I immediately reached out to Rob and said, hey, I didn't send that invite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| So I wasn't doing anything wrong. But the second one, how many was there, Mr. Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| Twenty-some. It was still a Zoom meeting, I believe, wasn't it? Yeah. It was still a Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| meeting at that time, but there were twenty-some members at that. I believe Ms. Mallard was present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| at both of them because she was on the board. No one contacted BZA in opposition? No. No one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| showed up to object to the BZA. Of course, the BZA appeal would have gone to this body. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| would have been a public process regardless. Council member McKenzie. Mr. Mullins, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| remain at the podium. It was mentioned by someone on your side about investment. So can someone give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| us an estimate to date of what the investment has been? Since the variances were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| we moved forward with additional due diligence. It's a, you know, it's an old industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| There's, you know, potential brownfield issues, core sampling, geotechnical sampling, architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| I'm in the wrong business. I should be an architect. They make a lot more money than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Some of it was legal fee, but very small, I'm sure. But it's about 1.8 million after the BZA variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| were granted. Once we knew we had the variances, we could then invest. And there are additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| plans and things that we had to move forward with, like the lotting plan, that we hadn't done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| until we knew we had the variances and we knew that the project would make sense. That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| the final approval for the ARC wasn't done until August 23, which that is correct, because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| was a few miscellaneous things. We have to invest more money to do more design work to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| that works. And we moved forward with confidence that we had the variances set because they weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| appealed by June 1. So if I understand you correctly, you're estimating about 1.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| dollars to date have been invested into this? After May 17, that's correct. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| And Mr. Ahrens, very quickly, a decision was made for this to be a level two. Based on variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| is there any instance where it could be escalated or elevated to a level three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| Or once that level two is done, that's a final decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| Once a level two is approved, that's a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| So regardless of the variances, even if variances would be in line if they had been included on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| front end, could have made it be a level three, it does not change regardless, once it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| determined, the level. I'm not sure I understand the context that you're describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| So it appears to me, and I may be wrong, that this appeal is because the community feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| these variances, I think, are out of scope with a level two. And this is why they're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| a level three. So what I'm asking you is, if the variances had been included in the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| framework that was submitted, could they have been considered a level three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4673)|
| 1:18:04| That would not be for the Administrative Review Committee to determine. Because variances are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| based on a hardship, and that's for the Board of Zoning Appeals to determine. That's not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| staff and planning staff to determine. And so if, as the code lays out, if you don't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| variances, it's not appropriate for your zoning compliance level one, if it's not a level two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| and you don't have variances, that's when, if you can't get the variances, that's when it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| kick it up to a level three. Only if the variances were not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| Correct. Otherwise, if you have a project that meets the intent of a level two, but it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| in this case, bigger, and they felt like they had a hardship which presented a logical reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| why they needed the variances, then we're not going to tell people they can't seek that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| Sure. It's up to them to articulate to the Board of Zoning Appeals why there is a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| and why they need those. Okay. Thank you. And Mr. Mullins, really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| what implication would, if this appeal was approved, what implication from a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4752)|
| 1:19:20| perspective would it have on your client? Well, we're out $1.8 million. If it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| I guess it's improved, and whether it can be applied in a way that it revokes our vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| rights, which we believe would be illegal under state law. Is this something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| applied prospectively for future developments? Is there some interpretation that's applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| prospectively, but not applied retroactively? But if we have to go back through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| you know, that's, you know, deadline right now. If we were able to put together a deadline for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| this for a level three review for the Planning Commission by the December 28 meeting, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| be looking at February Planning Commission meeting, then probably April City Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| and that's if there's no delays. That's assuming we can get everything done over the holidays. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| you're looking at six months and I don't know how much in additional delays. We haven't closed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| the property. We're still buying time to continue to have the right to close on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| because of this delay. If it weren't for this appeal and going through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| we would already own the property. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| Council Member Parker and then Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you, Mayor. And thank you to my colleagues for your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| because they have helped with my information gathering as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| A few things that stand out to me that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| The, it has been repeated that tonight we're focused on the process that this review went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4846)|
| 1:20:59| through, the level two review, rather than the level three review, and that the neighborhood does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| not object to the development. And I understand those arguments are being made so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| essentially have standing here tonight and can bring this before us. But I do need to hear those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| concerns because what I am struggling with is just simply based on the argument set before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4879)|
| 1:21:34| we do have an opportunity to address the concerns that have been raised through the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| process. And we are being asked to risk, you know, a potential lawsuit against the city for a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4899)|
| 1:21:53| amount when there aren't major concerns with the development itself. And that's what I'm struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4913)|
| 1:22:02| with. If this were, you know, I was talking to Rob Foster earlier and we were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4922)|
| 1:22:11| you know, saying if this was a nuclear waste dump site and somehow it slipped through and we had no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| timeline, no, you know, deadline on the appeal process, I could support an appeal that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4939)|
| 1:22:28| five years after that decision is made to prevent that nuclear waste site from coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| and pay whatever damages we have to. But in this case, I'm struggling because I'm struggling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4954)|
| 1:22:43| see what concerns may be addressed over the next six months that would warrant risking a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4963)|
| 1:22:53| $2 million lawsuit. That's what I'm struggling with. I appreciate that we do not have full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4973)|
| 1:23:01| clarity on whether we are dealing with a situation where there are vested rights in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4981)|
| 1:23:10| The August date was new information for me tonight as well. But my opinion is that a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=4990)|
| 1:23:21| and I'm still listening, but currently my opinion is that a process was followed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| it may be a flawed process that we need to address legislatively. But I'm struggling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| see that it warrants an approval of the appeal tonight. So that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you. Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Thank you, Mayor. What I'm hearing from the applicants is a need for a project of this scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5025)|
| 1:23:54| to have closer scrutiny, that they're asking for public review and community engagement, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| all of the things that we heard in the history leading up to the form-based code, what everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| was trying to put into it. And so somehow in the, I think we were saying 16 years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| that this has been in place, we seem to have drifted away from what was originally envisioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| And I totally sympathize with what you're saying and I agree with you. And I think this should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5061)|
| 1:24:30| looked at. I do. And I think we've heard from Councilman Smith and other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| this evening about just that need. So I hear what you're saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| And I think then the second question is, you know, the first question I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| is there something legislative that needs to be done to look at this, at least review it? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| the case has been made for doing that. Now, with regard to this specific situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| I've got some questions. So Director Ahrens, you know, if this does go through a level three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| review process, I think it's important for all of us to know what that would mean. So let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| that after this discussion this evening, this would go through a level three review. What would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| that look like? I'm not an attorney, so I'm not going to speak to vested rights. Well, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5121)|
| 1:25:30| want to talk about vested rights. I'm just asking process, strictly process. Yeah. What would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| if we rewound time and you had said we're doing a level three review, just like we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| potentially happen tonight? I'm just talking process. Process, we would go through, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| talking hypothetical now, correct? Yes. We would identify where the project doesn't meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| requirements. There's no need for variances. You have no hardship. You have to go to a level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| We go through the same process, identifying where things are in compliance, things that are not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| compliance. We make a recommendation to planning commission, and we let them decide. Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| planning, so it would go, you would do a review with staff. You would make a recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| planning commission. Yes. And then planning commission would vote. I think it's important to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| it's not just staff that's part of the administrative review committee. There's planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| staff in there as well. It's a pretty big collaborative. It includes Urban Forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| It includes, and all of that is spelled out in the code as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5192)|
| 1:26:42| As in 7.0.2.G.6.C, the administrator must prepare a report that reviews the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5202)|
| 1:26:56| in light of comments provided by the administrative review committee, and in light of the applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| form, district, and plan, the report recommendations and any related application materials must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| forwarded to the Metropolitan Planning Commission. So that's what the code says. That's what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| do. All right, so it goes to planning commission, and is that the end of it? Planning commission would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| hear it. That's part seven. They'd hold a public hearing. They would approve or deny, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5236)|
| 1:27:24| they can impose conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5244)|
| 1:27:34| Then there would be an appeal period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Then there'd be approval. They'd move forward. And where does the appeal go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| The appeal would go to you, I believe. Let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Yes, that would be part ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| Okay. And then I've got some additional questions too, but in looking at the level three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| compliance review, it seemed to me that one of the statements that kind of stands out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| that would not otherwise be allowed under a strict interpretation of form district regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| Does that seem like an important phrase to you in this review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5290)|
| 1:28:20| I think it's important to understand the importance of variances. There's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| projects that go through the city that require variances, and if you look at that language and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| say a strict interpretation means zero variances, I don't think that's what the intent of those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| mean. I think that's why the code says, hey, if you, there are variances, there's deviations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| and then if you're beyond those small items, you have to go to get variances. So if the code's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| telling you to go get variances, then I don't think that any variances would deem it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| an unstrict interpretation. I'm out of time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Thank you, Mayor. I'm just going to reiterate a couple things that my colleagues have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5348)|
| 1:29:17| and a little bit of what I struggle with. I mean, the variances went to BZA in May. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| the appeal period was the 1st of June, June 2nd, and it's now gone back to BZA for a third time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5365)|
| 1:29:40| and every time voted unanimously, and I very much hear that, you know, there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5380)|
| 1:29:50| more public process in the South Knox Waterfront Code, and then if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5390)|
| 1:29:58| then moving forward, then I think, you know, we changed the code, and I would also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| and I go back, that was reiterated, there's no time limit on the appeal, the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| decision, which needs to be instituted by this body, because, you know, that said, you can appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| in perpetuity, which is really a bit why we're here, because, you know, I do agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| with Council Member Parker in the sense that, you know, we've got, you've already had permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| issued, you've had an exorbitant amount of money spent, and then potentially to expose the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5433)|
| 1:30:43| to a pretty substantial lawsuit in their desire to recoup what they've invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5443)|
| 1:30:54| and, you know, I do feel like the process has been followed. I think the appellate has, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5454)|
| 1:31:04| we've heard that don't have an issue with the development that the process was followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| and that there doesn't seem to be anything, what I'm hearing is completely egregious as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5471)|
| 1:31:19| this needs to go back and be appealed and go to planning. So, I just, you know, I haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| anything that, you know, again, really compels me to uphold the appeal just based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5487)|
| 1:31:37| just based on what's being said, and if we need to change the process, then we need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| moving forward, and lesson learned in this, but I also feel like we really need to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5504)|
| 1:31:53| time limit on the appeal of the administrative decision, because, again, it could be six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| two years, five years, you know, once the development's already been built, and I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| again, it would be hard at that juncture, but I feel like there have to be better parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| because it just can't be go to BZA and leave it up to their discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| in determining what's reasonable, and then we find ourselves here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you, Councilmember Smith, and then Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| Thank you, Mayor. I want to address some of my colleagues' questions, because they're very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| very wise, and I want to make sure we're all on the same page. The developer did follow the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5553)|
| 1:32:42| This is part of the process, too, and while I agree that having an unending period of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| is unhealthy, this isn't nine months later. This isn't a year later, and there's no reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| that the development plans that have been submitted through this process can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| submitted to planning, and other than Mr. Mullen's fees, which appear to be cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| so no worry about that. I think you said you had the wrong career. I think you got a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| but maybe you need to raise your fees. My point is, the $1.8 million that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| floated out there is real. It's real risk. I get that. These development plans that are before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| BZA and before us can go before Planning Commission. Second of all, BZA, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| expert in certain areas, which is why they're on that board, they're not export planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| and they're not Planning Commission staff, and there's a reason that Level 3 is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| The third is, I think it's really important that, as I understand it from the appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| they're not opposed to developing the land. However, this development itself is excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| so it's not as if they don't have a problem with this development. It's extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| In fact, some of these go over, multiple go over 100% increases from what's intended in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| the South Waterfront Code, so you can't unwind this. This is not a benign kind of, we didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| you know, no problem with the development. There's a significant problem with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| It doesn't align with the strict interpretation of the South Waterfront Code. That's explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| There's a lot to be desired from the code. I don't fault Mr. Ahrens for his interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| I respect you immensely. I just think that this particular development, in its size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| does something very important. It doesn't ask for variances. The scope of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| basically rezones this. If you look at the collective sum of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| this takes it into a new zone beyond what was intended in the South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| I remember the first meeting I was on council. We reviewed the tiniest variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| for a neighborhood in Old Sevier for a development behind Century Landing, and it was about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| the building curved with the road or not. And that body, and this body decided at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| that even that was not in compliance with the South Waterfront Code. That was a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| This is not a variance. But if this body agreed at that time that the curvature of a road was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| significant enough to review whether it aligns with the intent of a code that dates 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and hasn't been changed and was not reviewed as part of recode and has not been reviewed since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5723)|
| 1:35:30| if a curvature of a road is significant enough to protect the South Waterfront Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| six things, not in their individual state, but in the collective sum total of the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| takes this to a different place, takes it to a new zoning that doesn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| and that's why I think planning staff can review this. The developer's fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| their investment is welcome in the South Waterfront. I don't think that the scale of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| this fits with the strict interpretation, but the purpose of tonight is to not determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| the property is vested rights. I would make the case that there's state law that suggests that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| it's not. That's not what we're here for. This body's determined whether level three should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| have been decided for this development. I think it's appropriate. There's a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| There's expert planners that wait for this to review it. And they can make amendments to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| that make it align with the strict interpretation of the South Waterfront Code. Until we as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| address the lack of specificity within the South Waterfront Code, we have to go with the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| And so tonight I've heard a lot about following the process. Everybody here has dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| neighborhoods and looked at a development that they thought, not the best, but it's in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| And so there's a process in the code that this appellant is following for greater scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| of a significantly deviated project that is beyond the strict interpretation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| So it suggests that just like the developer followed the process, allow this appeal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| follow the process. If county commission amends this in a way that this body approves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| or they don't touch it all again... You mean planning commission. What did I say? County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| commission. We're not going to let them touch it. Thank you. Yeah, we don't need any crossover at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| the moment. My point is, according to Mr. Ahrens and is outlined in the process of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| this will come back to us. We can have a full understanding of this with planning staff input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| The developer then will have followed every bit of process as will this body as well. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| nothing wrong with sending this to planning commission. There's no lost revenue, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| for legal fees, the same development, same architect. There's no dirt moved. They haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| even purchased the property. I hope you buy it. I hope you develop it well. You're welcome there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| Thank you. Council Member Reiter. Yeah. Okay. Mr. Ahrens, I'm going to call on you. So I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| you to come to the podium and I may ask Mr. Frost some questions. Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| Okay. First off, I got to say the vesting question, not going to consider it in the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Who I know in the room, that's not part of the decision. The decision is to look at the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| at hand. The appeal is whether Mr. Ahrens interpreted this code correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5901)|
| 1:38:31| The conversation, the facts that Mr. Councilman Smith just gave us are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5911)|
| 1:38:40| the variances that were approved in May were wildly out of scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| with the South Waterfront and the intent of the South Waterfront Code. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| you just discussed, is that they are out of camber with the South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| Those were determined in May and the appeal time for those ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Okay. Hear me out. So the question at hand, the appeal is, since that's off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5945)|
| 1:39:14| we can't appeal those variances. We can be annoyed the BZA approved them. We can be mad that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| didn't show up. We can ask them that they met with those people and talked with them, but they still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| didn't say and they still didn't show up. But what we're determining is, did Mr. Ahrens read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| correctly? So Mr. Frost, I've shown you 7.01. I'm going to pretend that I'm Mr. Ahrens and I get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| to do his job. 7.01.1 introductory provisions. There's A, the purpose and the intent. There's B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5979)|
| 1:39:47| the district's established. C, how to use this code for new development. Step one, determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| what form district your property is located in by going to KGIS. I've determined I'm in the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| Waterfront. Step two, once you've determined what form district you are in, you need to find out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| sub-district applies to your property. Did that? I'm sure Mr. Mullins did that for his clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| Step three, verify what type of approval process you must go through. 3A, for an application related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| to a single-family house or two-family duplex, go to 7.0.2.E. 3B, for an application related to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6016)|
| 1:40:26| multi-dwelling mixed-use or non-residential structure, go to section 7.0.2.F. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6026)|
| 1:40:35| correct? I read this all correctly? Yes. Mr. Ahrens, is that the process? That's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| So at this point on this page in 7.0.1 section C, number three, it tells me to turn to section 7.0.2.F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6041)|
| 1:40:52| So I'm going to flip a few pages. See, one of the questions that was being debated earlier was whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| this gives a process to go to step two versus jump into step three. But I just explicitly said to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| it says go to step two. So I go to step two, which is the 7.0.2 level two, development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6065)|
| 1:41:15| Purpose, development plan review is intended to ensure that all multi-dwelling mixed-use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| non-residential structures comply with the requirements of the applicable form district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| So how do we determine that what to ensure that all multi-dwelling structures comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| requirements of the applicable form district? So what they wanted to build doesn't comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| the form district. So then it talks about the applicability and the authority and the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| criteria and it goes on to talk about unlisted standards and refers them in section 8.C to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| article 16.3, which is the board of zoning appeals. Is this your process? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| question that the struggle that I have here is there's a flaw in the code. We don't like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| code because we want this to go to level three because it doesn't comply with the with right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| with the code to a strict letter of the law, but if you follow the code and read this, it says go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| to level two and go get a variance. So if I approve this appeal, I'm saying shame on you, Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| you didn't interpret the code correctly and anybody who comes to town, you can't trust what we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| here because that's not what we really mean. So I mean that's how I'm reading it and if I were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| sitting in Mr. Ahrens' shoes or Mr. Mullen's shoes, that's how I would determine it and the issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| I have with it is I've pulled permits before and I would be none too happy if I go through all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| process and pay for my permits and get my variances. I've gotten variances before and then the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| window goes by and then I can't have my permit. I got to start back over like it's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| candy land. I hit the wrong square and I got to go back to the beginning because this says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| and so that's all Mr. Ahrens can do is do what we told him to do in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| and then my five minutes is up. Thank you. Council Member Thomas. Yes, I had a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| Swanson. It may be repetitive but for the sake of clarity, you said that this appeal was ripe. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| So the appeal that's ripe is whether or not the decision on level two or level three. No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| This is what the appeal that is ripe is whether or not Peter Ahrens properly read the code and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| interpreted the code. That's the only appeal that's ripe. The appeal is not whether it should be level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| two or level three. The appeal is rather whether Peter Ahrens properly interpreted the code, read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| it correctly. Okay, so the decision at question is whether or not he properly decided whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| it was level two. Level two was appropriate or level three was appropriate. Whether he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| interpreted the code correctly in determining that it was a level two. Yes. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you. Vice Mayor Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| Director Swanson, if the question before us tonight is did Director Ahrens interpret the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| properly, then what remedy is it to talk about this review one, review two, review three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6273)|
| 1:44:47| Basically what we're going to end up saying is Director Ahrens, you need to have interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| this a different way, but it's already been interpreted and it sounds like all the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| appeals times have already passed. I regret that I agreed that the question was whether he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6297)|
| 1:45:05| interpreted it properly. That's really not the question. The question is did he read it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| Did he read it correctly and apply what he read correctly? And so the issue is not whether this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6309)|
| 1:45:18| ought to be level one or level two. That's ultimately your decision, but you put it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| the code and you make it clear whether something is level one or level two. What Peter Ahrens has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| got to do is read the code that's before him, not interpret the code that comes before him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| whether it should be this way or should be that way. He should read it, and if he can interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| it as he reads it, then you should not uphold the appeal. You should uphold Peter Ahrens and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6340)|
| 1:45:50| reading of the code. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| I think so, because I was just trying to get some clarity from what you had just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| Ms. Toker, what about this project would not otherwise be allowed under strict interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6359)|
| 1:46:09| of the form district regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| The six items that I read to you are all way outside of the extraordinary deviations to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6373)|
| 1:46:26| code. Transparency, the riverfront access, being able to see the riverfront from the road. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6386)|
| 1:46:39| six variances that were requested and granted. Building height. If you listen to the BGA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6399)|
| 1:46:49| you put it very clearly that we're not here to oppose the development or the decisions of BGA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6409)|
| 1:46:59| but we certainly want development that is within the south waterfront vision and within the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6419)|
| 1:47:08| So you're asking what does not fit, well, the six items that I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| So the variance appeals. The six variance appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6435)|
| 1:47:23| That is what makes this development not fit within what the vision is for the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| Part of the vision for the south waterfront is pedestrian-friendly retail on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| The lack of transparency, and transparency meaning transparency of the ground floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| means that there is not the ability to have the retail that is going to encourage the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6462)|
| 1:47:53| nature that is desired for the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you. Director Ahrens, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| Can I just add to that a little bit? You asked what I think what you were asking was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| What about this project would not otherwise be allowed under strict interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| She spoke to the transparency variance. The lot size is proposed is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6496)|
| 1:48:25| I believe it's five and a half acres, and the maximum lot size allowed is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| The maximum block size perimeter is 1,400 square feet, and I believe this proposal is 1,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| They're asking for an extra story. Oh, thank you, Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| The front setback is 275% bigger than what is allowed, and the building itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6524)|
| 1:48:54| they're requesting 68,000 square feet for the building size where only 30,000 square feet is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| allowed. So you should have those numbers somewhere in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| I do. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Craig. Director Ahrens, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6545)|
| 1:49:16| The question is, what about this project makes it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| What about this project would not otherwise be allowed under strict interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| of the form district regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| Those same six items, had they been disapproved by the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| So the issue is, if they had been disapproved, then it would trigger this third review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6579)|
| 1:49:39| That's your interpretation. Okay. And then, if I can get just a little bit of grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| and I'm not sure to ask this question to you, maybe Mr. Ahrens, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| what are some examples of triggering vested rights in a context similar to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| So we had this discussion about vested rights. I think we understood a little bit about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| those were and what state law prohibits, but my question is, we didn't get into any examples of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| what would trigger vested rights. So are there some commonly held or available items we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| think of that would trigger vested rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| I can read you what the code says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| This is Article 15.3, Vesting. In accordance with Tennessee Code Annotated 13-4-310,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| the following provides for the vesting of developments through zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6627)|
| 1:50:36| I'm going to go to jump down to Part B. A vested property right is established with respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| any property upon the appropriate department's approval of a preliminary or final development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| plan in other districts. Number B-5, approval of a form district project, I think would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6649)|
| 1:50:58| applicable here, where once the property is established, it is not subject to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| zoning code. I won't speak to the legality. Is that what you're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6665)|
| 1:51:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| I am not sure who was next. Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| I was just going to ask Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| To talk about vesting, you wanted to, in your initial five minutes, and if you want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6695)|
| 1:51:46| the process and share any other thoughts you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| Sure. I appreciate that. There are two approvals here that created vested rights. The first was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| the variances that were approved in May 17 and then that were not appealed by June 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| Those variances at that time became final. The six things that they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6723)|
| 1:52:16| that cannot be taken away now. That is final. A handy guide that I used for understanding vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6736)|
| 1:52:25| rights when I was really studying this, the state law used to be you had to have substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| investments in a building permit. That was a hard standard to meet. In 2014, the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| legislature changed the law to make it a date certain. That is, if you get approval for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| something that becomes final, at that time, your rights are vested. Actually, Ms. Hatfield did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6762)|
| 1:52:51| seminar on it, vested property rights of 2014. When they talked about things that would trigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| vested rights, they talked about subdivision approvals, site plans for new developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| which would be the ARC approval, building permits, and any other approvals for the development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| the property, which would be the variances. Those are two things that would create the vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| rights. Now, it is true that the final ARC approval didn't happen until August 23 and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| appeal was filed August 8. The appeal August 8 doesn't stop the process. There's nothing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| code that says if an appeal is filed, you can no longer go through and get anything else approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| That would have to be in the code. When you're dealing with interpretations, when you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| with zoning laws that are in derogation of the common law, case law tells us, well, this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| has a tremendous amount of discretion. That discretion has to be exercised within existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| standards. There's no standard that stops the process if someone is appealing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| They need to appeal the process earlier, which they had an opportunity to do so during the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| period for the variances. And if I could just add one more thing. We talked about the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6834)|
| 1:54:02| in the Level 3 about the strict application, that the project doesn't meet the strict application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| of the code. Following up on Ms. Ryder's progression, when you get to Part F8C, where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6847)|
| 1:54:15| says if you don't meet these standards, you have to go get a variance, the standard for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| under 16.3e says the Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize a variance from the strict application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| of the code so as to relieve such difficulties or hardships in accordance with the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| criteria. Then they go through the criteria for hardships, which is a very different standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| than the criteria for a Level 3 review. That's community benefit. If it adds some extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| benefit, that's a different standard. There's different standards that apply when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| looking at whether or not it meets a strict application. We demonstrated to the BZA that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| met the criteria for a variance from the strict application of the code under the hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| standards. That's why our rights are vested. Thank you. To clarify, you know, obviously tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| we're voting on whether Mr. Ahrens interpreted or read and then implemented the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6903)|
| 1:55:12| Based on what our vote is tonight, Mr. Swanson, does it then automatically go to Level 3 into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6912)|
| 1:55:20| planning or we're just voting on whether? I'm just trying to clarify for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| Your vote will be whether or not he read the code correctly, whether he applied the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| correctly. And then what? Under these circumstances. And if he did, he did. If he didn't, then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6932)|
| 1:55:41| to see whether they have vested rights or not that entitle them to proceed with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| If they prove they have vested rights that entitle them to proceed with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| then they're going to proceed with the development. So it could be the answer is the same either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| But I'm not going to opine on whether or not they have vested rights that allow them to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| unless I have to, unless I'm forced to. Okay. I'm just trying to clarify for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| this process since obviously it is quite complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| I don't know. I thought Mr. Smith. Okay. Council Member Smith. I don't want to, if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| have the last words, you can. You want me to say something? You have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| Waste my time arguing about who's going to talk first. You can start the clock. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| I don't envy anyone here. Councilman Smith, I know you've been handling this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| I want to support you and the South Waterfront community in revising the code to get what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| need so that Mr. Ahrens can do, and his team can do his job the way that the vision was intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7009)|
| 1:56:59| I read this, and I see he followed it, and I would have done exactly what he did because that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| it reads. We, the legislative body, approve and have the power to change our code of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7024)|
| 1:57:13| and we have ordinances about many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| You know, it's not just building code, and we ask the staff of the city to apply this every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| and what we're doing today is really putting the interpretation or the staff's ability to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| job on trial, and that is causing me some great discomfort, and I would have read it the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| he did, and if that's where the error is that it needs to be changed to say if it doesn't meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| letter of the, that there's any discrepancy from the code, any curve to follow the street, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| goes to a level three, then that's how the code needs to get changed, but I want the staff of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| city to feel confident in the codes that we have on the books and uphold, and then we change them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| rather than test them and question them over how they read the words because this is how they read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| that these folks were allowed to get a variance, and they did, and the variance wasn't appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| and we can't put that back in the, sorry, we can't put that back in the barn. It's, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7094)|
| 1:58:27| Okay. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you. This will be my last comment. I think there's three things I'd like to address. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| I've asked for amending the code for the better part of two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| Not to me because that'd be a sunshine violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| I'm not talking to you, that's right, but I've requested this. Planning has admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| so there was foresight, so this idea, I realize that some of you all not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| in this district all the time don't hear the desire for this. I'm telling you that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| has been advocated for for two and a half years or actually longer since I joined council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| so it's not for you all to hear. You realize you don't get all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| but this could have been prevented had that request been resolved. So to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7148)|
| 1:59:16| while I appreciate Mr. Ahrens' circumstance, it's administration's role to address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7156)|
| 1:59:23| so that Mr. Ahrens isn't put in this position. I think the second thing I want to highlight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| again, there's discretion in here. There's not a linear progression to level three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| except for one circumstance, which doesn't mean you can't use level three for other circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| and there's not a linear progression specifically to level three, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| But Mr. Ahrens knows the code better than anybody else, so it's not as if he's just walking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| the crumb trail within the code, although I appreciate the desire to be very specific about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| how one might evaluate this. Mr. Ahrens knows this code better than anybody in the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| and is aware of the limitations and the desire and the strict interpretation of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| better than anybody. And I would just remind everyone that we are here to interpret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7208)|
| 2:00:19| or excuse me, to decide on whether Mr. Ahrens interpreted level two or level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| And without specificity around that interpretation, we should always go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7223)|
| 2:00:31| when possible, the architect of the words. And we have that community in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| the ones that know what was implicit in these words. And this is not a development that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7238)|
| 2:00:48| negligible. There are parts in the South Waterfront Code that are in here for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7248)|
| 2:00:56| View corridors and public open spaces will connect these areas to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| Building heights were restrictions to mitigate the natural effect on existing neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| Ground floor level transparency on the principal frontage in section 701 explicitly because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7267)|

| 2:01:19| specific areas of the city upon adoption of small area plans. If you just look at this specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| element in isolation, I can understand how you wouldn't progress to level three. But Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| is not restricted to this particular clause because he understands the entire code and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| the whole body of the intent of the South Waterfront Code. So he has to review the level one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| level two, level three decision in the grander context of the South Waterfront Code as it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7303)|
| 2:01:50| specifically in level three and level two as it relates to the strict interpretation of the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7310)|
| 2:01:56| Waterfront Code. The entire body of work is asked to interpret specific steps within different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7316)|
| 2:02:05| decisions, but it's in the context of the entire South Waterfront Code of which he's well-informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| and an expert. I'll let my colleagues finish up some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| I think Councilmember Thomas had his light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| Councilmember Smith covered most of the territory that I wanted to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| And looking at the criteria and the deviations that were made from the form code, they are major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7348)|
| 2:02:43| And you're looking at these standards where the lot size perimeter is expanded by 37.3% deviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7363)|
| 2:02:54| lot size 83.3% deviation from the standards, the front setback 275% deviation, building height 29%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7374)|
| 2:03:07| deviation, building footprint 127% deviation, ground level transparency 45, between 45 and 31%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7387)|
| 2:03:17| deviation. And in all due respect, I feel that the proper reading of the code as applied to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7397)|
| 2:03:31| circumstances would require a level three review. And this appeal is ripe. We have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7411)|
| 2:03:45| and the duty to review it. And I think there was an error made in the decision that this was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| to level two instead of level three. Simply, you look at these deviations from the standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| they are major. And just a comment about whether things have vested or not, the rights have vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7439)|
| 2:04:10| I think it's certainly arguable that since this is still ripe for appeal, one could argue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| these property rights have vested because they are still under appeal. So that's succinctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7456)|
| 2:04:23| that's my position. And I think Councilman Smith has got the assessment correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7463)|
| 2:04:33| Thank you. Councilmember McKenzie and then Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Thank you, Mayor. This is a very complex issue as we want to respect the viewpoints of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7477)|
| 2:04:47| neighborhood and the community that's there. And Councilmember Ryder read exactly, word for word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7487)|
| 2:04:57| what we as a body approved. And for us to penalize the developer who proceeded on good faith based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7497)|
| 2:05:07| on how the code was interpreted and based on how she read it, it was. I think we as a body do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| to go back and we need to look at that. Councilmember Smith, it sounds like this needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| be escalated immediately. It sounds like there potentially might be a disconnect between BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7520)|
| 2:05:27| and their interpretation of the South Waterfront Code as well, if these variances were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7527)|
| 2:05:33| And this is not within that scope at this point, but strictly based on those facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| I would not be able to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| Vice Mayor Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. I appreciate everyone's comments tonight. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| a lot of respect for everyone that's come and spoke tonight about this. Definitely a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| issue and one where I think we've all struggled through the evening to figure out where we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| to go. I think for me the end place is I think that we always end up with better development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7563)|
| 2:06:13| better projects, when we encourage public review and we encourage public engagement. And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| absolutely hear what the appellants are saying this evening and I'm committed to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7581)|
| 2:06:29| that review that we've discussed this evening. I hear Councilman Smith saying that he's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7589)|
| 2:06:39| asking for this for a long time and I think he's asked enough. I think we need to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| That brings us to what we're dealing with tonight, which is a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| And this process, like I just mentioned, needs attention. But at the end of the day, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| have to make a decision on what is in front of us now. What is the process that's in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| now? Not what we want it to be or what we might change it to be, because that's the only way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| it's fair to everybody that was involved. And so based on that, I can't support the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| but I do support the need for examining this and making sure that you have the public review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| that you need in the future. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| Thank you. There's not a motion on the floor. Mr. Smith, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| I'll make a motion in just a minute. I think I would add two things and then I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7651)|
| 2:07:41| Everybody here is following the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| I don't think there's anybody that's not followed the appropriate processes outlined in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| The developer followed the process. The appellant followed the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7668)|
| 2:07:55| This inherently has a deadline. Vested rights do happen. I think that's not for us to decide when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| that happened, but I would argue that we don't hear approval for rezoning when there's an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7681)|
| 2:08:12| before BZA. Why is that? If there's an appeal before BZA or there's an appeal before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7692)|
| 2:08:20| rezonings don't happen. This appeal was submitted before the development plan was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7700)|
| 2:08:28| So we shouldn't approve the development plan, the BZA appeal, or if there's an appeal before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| council. So the idea that there are approvals made on things pending appeal is just not real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7714)|
| 2:08:41| So we shouldn't feel confined to vesting of any sort. This happened before the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7721)|
| 2:08:48| was approved. The second thing I would tell you is, as a reminder, this can go before planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| commission. The second thing I would suggest is that $1.8 million the developer's not out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| there's no question of anything. This is following a procedure. This is in the code as well. So to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| the extent the developer understands our processes, they know that this is in there as well. They may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| not have some certainty about it, but obviously neither do we because we're deciding this for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| first time. So as a reminder from the beginning of what I said is, there's discretion built into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7756)|
| 2:09:23| this for how we think Mr. Aaron should have interpreted this decision. And $1.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7763)|
| 2:09:31| while a significant risk and as a great investment in our community, pales in comparison to a south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| waterfront and the value that it has and thing that can't be undone. And so I don't want this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7778)|
| 2:09:45| development to go away. I would prefer it be a different shape, but I don't think that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| anything about sending this to the planning commission that does any harm to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| the community, or the opportunity for the south waterfront. With that, I'll make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| approve the appeal. I'll second. Motion's been made to approve. The appeal has been made and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| seconded. Council Member Ryder. Yeah, I just wanted to clarify something. No matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7806)|
| 2:10:14| happens with this vote, Mr. Frost, once variances are approved, they run with the land. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7814)|
| 2:10:23| correct? Yes, I believe that's right. Okay, so the six variances that were approved, whether a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| permit is ever issued, those variances are there. So Sasquatch or some company from Timbuktu could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7829)|
| 2:10:38| come buy the land down the road and those variances are there. Okay, I just thought that was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| for everybody to remember. Even if this goes to a level three review, the variance, they're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| until somebody undoes them. I don't know. They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| Okay, any other questions or comments? Okay, the motion on the floor is to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7857)|
| 2:11:07| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No. I think we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=7867)|

| 2:13:37| Thank you, Mayor. I just have a question for Mr. Clavo. Welcome back. I think there's a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| in here that says this funding or this project will be completed by the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| This will probably have to be amended at some point. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| Yes. The amendment is for a TDOT contract which was prepared by TDOT and it has a completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8033)|
| 2:14:03| date of the end of December of next year. We're anticipating projects starting summer of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8043)|

| 2:14:16| amended for time. Do you think we'll be able to do that? Yes. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8056)|

| 2:14:53| this sidewalk. It's a big deal to connect that entire neighborhood and it just has taken a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8093)|
| 2:15:00| time but it's been worth the wait and I think it's been methodical and I think it's just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| pull together an entire neighborhood there in South Haven. So I'm grateful for the work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| gone into this. Any further questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8112)|

| 2:15:46| Rick Roach, you signed up to speak to this item. Mr. Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| you can come to the podium, state your name and address for the record and you will have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| five minutes. Rick Roach, Knoxville. I'm also signed up for E and I maybe could combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8154)|
| 2:16:05| the two because they're similar. Just wanted to address particular issues and get some clarity on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8165)|
| 2:16:16| lobbyist city employing consultants and or lobbyists and the expenditures for that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| how are those prioritized in terms of the state government and the federal government and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| relationships and maybe corporate entities that you may, that the city may join with at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| point in time. And I'm coming at it from this direction, policy first and foremost. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8196)|
| 2:16:45| not had a lot of clarity. We have not had a lot of transparency as far as the city's policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| until on any particular issue, sometimes until it's too late for the public to have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8210)|
| 2:17:01| And if you're going to go out here and have a hired gun, do your bidding, especially with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| state government, especially with federal government. A few dollars are passed in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| and potential, a lot of dollars, a lot of resources can come in from the federal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| state government. It would seem that the public would have to, should know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| on the front end policy-wise about, you know, as far as the city goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| So I, you know, I have no problem with the concept of, you know, lobbying and consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8251)|
| 2:17:40| firms. But I think the city should be upfront and transparent about what the policies are and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8260)|
| 2:17:47| they're employing, you know, the consultants and the lobbyists and what they expect to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| you know, with the dollars expended. And right now, the way things, the little bit that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| read about, especially on coming, I guess, for E Cornerstone, they're a pretty expansive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| consulting group. And, you know, what do we expect to get? What do you expect to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| you know, from that whole process? I don't know if you want to answer the question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8294)|
| 2:18:27| Would there be any comment? I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Mr. Rich, the council members will have their discussion following public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| And again, E, you can continue the conversation through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| I'm just looking at some of the background information for this particular lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8320)|
| 2:18:48| They deal with all types of institutions. And one of the local issues that I can see where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8328)|
| 2:18:57| might come about, let's say the city has a policy with an advisory group. And they've just come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8337)|
| 2:19:06| Park, for instance, come into a recent agreement, signed an agreement to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| with their functions with the police department of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| What would be the city's policy in terms of potentially strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8359)|
| 2:19:26| the, you know, the enforcement capabilities of Park, let's say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| Would, is that, you know, could you have that stated, you know, forward and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| we're going to have this, have Fred Thompson group or Cornerstone group go to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8380)|
| 2:19:50| and in conjunction, you know, speak with our Knox County legislative group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| help try to push forward, speak with other municipalities, try to form a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| to push forward legislation at the state level in order to strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8402)|
| 2:20:09| police advisory committees and have them be advisory no more, have them have some jurisdictional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| power, civilian control. Is that something policy-wise that the city would pursue or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8415)|
| 2:20:25| Would you want to be more restrictive for an advisory group such as Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8425)|
| 2:20:32| Those types of situations. Again, policy connected with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| the solicitation of services from consulting groups and lobbying groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8438)|
| 2:20:45| Got 12 seconds. Breathe deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| Okay. Thank you. Council members, any questions or discussion? Council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| Sure. I would love to have some of these questions answered. Is there someone who can speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| Well, yeah, I'll have, I'll ask Fiona McAnally to come and speak to this, but I will just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| that the reason we have lobbyists is to help us with legislation and, you know, navigating things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| at the state and federal level and also understanding the art of the possible, given who represents us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8472)|
| 2:21:19| in the General Assembly in Nashville and who represents us in Congress and the Biden administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| It's not just what we want. It's what we can achieve and that's advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| Park, the state was taking away subpoena power and it was probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| this work that helped Knoxville retain some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| Absolutely. Sometimes we have to play defense to protect the things that we already have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| want to keep and strengthening them or changing them is not a viable option. So that's, Park is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8505)|
| 2:21:53| a good example of that being the case. I'm going to ask Ms. McAnally to elaborate on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| other, do you have, can you, just a specific question or? No. Okay, just, yeah, can you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8520)|
| 2:22:08| speak to the work that we rely on Mr. Thompson for in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| Sure. Fiona McAnally, Director of Legislative Affairs. And, you know, a lot of our work these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| days is defense. We do play defense, keeping bills from passing or amending them so they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8539)|
| 2:22:26| the least amount of negative impact on the policies of this administration and this city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| And we do work with the other cities collaboratively, both as individuals, our lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| teams, our in-house people. So we generally meet at least once a week during session to coordinate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| to make sure Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville are on the same page. But an example of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| especially in regard to the Citizen Advisory Committee, Park, the legislature was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8569)|
| 2:22:56| weaken the Nashville Advisory Committee a few years ago. And that's an example of where we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| come together to try to keep and maintain the current structure. Sometimes Knoxville gets caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| up in other cities' issues, and so we also have to clarify that, how we're different or how we align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| But yeah, in general, philosophically, there's about 1,500 bills a year, about 3,000 bills over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8595)|
| 2:23:23| two years in a legislative session. That's a lot of bills, and a lot of them impact Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| So thankfully, we've had Tony down in Nashville for over 20 years, keeping an eye on that and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| those may impact the city, whether from a financial perspective, from tax law, or to zoning, land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8615)|
| 2:23:43| Every issue under the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| Any other questions or comments? Okay, seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8629)|

| 2:24:25| respectfully, Mayor, it's not been a trademark of this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| to be transparent on the front end about what is desired in terms of policy development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8669)|
| 2:24:39| And the most affected communities are always the last to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| And, you know, I don't know what to tell you, you know, as regards to this, it's very frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8684)|

| 2:24:57| Different picture is painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| Coming from the affected community and coming from city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| And, you know, I brought this up before the city council, but like I said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8705)|
| 2:25:13| that's on you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| Thank you. I think Councilmember Parker and then Ryder and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| I had a few concerns when I saw this item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| In particular, because the legislative branch was specifically mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8729)|
| 2:25:39| And I know that there are other priorities that have been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8739)|
| 2:25:49| especially during audit committee meetings of the need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| expand capacity within the legislative office when it comes to auditing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| capacity being one definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| I appreciate the hard work of Rob Frost, but I have to admit that it's been a little shocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8764)|
| 2:26:12| for me since being elected, realizing what limited time Mr. Frost has for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| He's not a full time employee accessible at all hours of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| And I think these are important conversations to have in regards to what the legislative branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| of city government needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| And we just haven't had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| So I was surprised to see this item come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| And it would be my preference that we would allocate funding towards the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8802)|
| 2:26:49| office to increase its capacity before we increase our lobbying capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8809)|
| 2:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| Councilmember Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Yeah, Ms. McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| I don't know if you're the one to answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| So I'm familiar with Mr. Thompson because we see him at various events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| and different times through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I'm not familiar with Cornerstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| And in looking at this agenda item, this is specifically a lobbyist that the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| uses for executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8839)|
| 2:27:25| Is this a local firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Is it a Tennessee firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| Is it somebody that you communicate with, the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| Could you just familiarize me a little better with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Because I'm just not, I don't know of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8857)|
| 2:27:37| I have some one-on-one conversations with Mr. Thompson, but not with this entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| So yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| Cornerstone Government Affairs is a new relationship for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| They are based in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| They're a bipartisan government affairs firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| They have former staff that have worked in various administrations and on the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| And Aaron Gill and myself meet with them about every two weeks to discuss Knoxville's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8877)|
| 2:28:04| And we set up additional meetings as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| Right now, our real focus is on federal grants and finding those and finding them early and often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| We get a report weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| And some of these windows on these big grants, multi-million dollar grants, is only about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| eight weeks, 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| So if we can find out before they're released or the day they're released, it gives us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| head start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| And that's one thing Cornerstone is doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| They're also helping us being very strategic about going in for some of these larger grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| They helped shape the Reconnecting Communities proposal we submitted, or KCDC submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8919)|
| 2:28:46| and currently helping us on another major grant proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| So that was for housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| The KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| Reconnecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| The Transforming Western is a mixed housing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Reconnecting Communities is more about the connecting to Greenway sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| from all the way along the Cultural Corridor up to Standard Netting Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| over to Eastside, Botanical Gardens, all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| Austin Homes, Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| There's a lot of big federal programs that passed legislatively in the last year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| but they're now just kind of getting formed into grant programs that we can see and apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8959)|
| 2:29:25| The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a big example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| Those grant programs, you heard a lot when the bill was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| but it takes a long time to go from that to an actual grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| The Reconnecting Communities was the first time they've ever done that grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| So these are new and different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| In addition, we're shaping a lot of our asks for appropriation earmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| and that is on the congressional side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Some of our projects where we might be able to get capital funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| from another source other than our own local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| So the other thing I guess they can do, and that's a little harder to quantify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=8999)|
| 2:30:05| is the contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| If the mayor is going to D.C. and wants to meet with various administration officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| to continue and nurture relationships with this administration, they can set those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9011)|
| 2:30:18| They can set up meetings with deputy assistant secretaries and undersecretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| So that's harder to quantify, but it's important to the entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Council, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9038)|
| 2:30:38| Motion carries 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| to apply for and, if awarded, accept grant funding of up to $30,000 with no city match required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| from the National League of Cities to be used to expand economic opportunities for residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9054)|
| 2:30:59| and businesses of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9063)|
| 2:31:12| I would like to learn more about the work that the city is doing in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| I reached out to Dr. Lomax to have a meeting on this very topic before he moved on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9077)|
| 2:31:26| I was referred to Harold Cannon, and so I was a little surprised when I saw this renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9086)|
| 2:31:35| under community empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| Just going back to what the public speaker said, it's a continued concern I have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| transparency, and there's not much transparency around this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| And so I think it would be good to get an update and get a clear understanding of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| intentions and future anticipated investments to be made to be able to realize some gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9117)|
| 2:32:09| from some of the learning that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9133)|
| 2:32:13| Yeah, I was just in Atlanta at a convening at the National League of Cities with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| other mayors and city leaders, and Pamela Cotham and Tiffany Coombs and Cheryl Ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9137)|
| 2:32:25| are there still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| So I would say the main gist of this particular effort will be on diverse business enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9146)|
| 2:32:32| and supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| But Ms. Gill, could you elaborate a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Thank you, Ms. Parker, and thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| So you referenced in the packet here that this is the second phase of the Southern Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| Economic Inclusion Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| We brought the initial application phase to you, I want to say around a year ago, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| that is the phase in which the mayor referenced earlier that we are continuing to engage with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| National League of Cities to build capacity at the leadership level, at the staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| but also intentionally for this particular initiative with a community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| So through this current, the phase one grant that we've already received, we have engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9187)|
| 2:33:15| with the Women LLC, and the mayor was joined in Atlanta by Ms. Deirdre Harper, who is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| representing that community partner with us as we think about opportunities to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| with local minority-owned firms and build not only the capacity of the city, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| the thinking about strategies and expanding understanding of best practices when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| to how city governments can engage with DBE firms, DBE partners, and continue to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9219)|
| 2:33:48| that opportunity that aligns with a lot of the work that we're currently doing with Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| Cawtham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| So this phase two section is an expectation when you work with National League of Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| that you would build some capacity under this phase one engagement, and then you apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| a implementation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| So mayor and her team, as they were down there, talked about good strategy, a proposal around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=9244)|

| 2:54:13| 2010, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| That's when it was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| It was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10457)|
| 2:54:18| It was a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10458)|
| 2:54:18| Everybody, you know, environmentally great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10458)|
| 2:54:24| We got stuff growing on the roof and everything, centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10464)|
| 2:54:30| And then, you know, Megabus came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10470)|
| 2:54:35| And I rode Megabus a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| And they get off right down there at the CAT station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| And so, bottom line was, we heard this conversation about what it's going to take to get Greyhound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10483)|
| 2:54:50| keep Greyhound happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| You know, the building got sold out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| Nobody was really paying any attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| City didn't really have a plan about what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10496)|
| 2:55:02| And now we've got what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| And, you know, just found a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10505)|
| 2:55:13| A Fifth Avenue person that was missing back in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| I warned that this kind of stuff was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10521)|
| 2:55:25| That we were going to have these kind of results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| Getting ready to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| And it's funny how sometimes you don't think about these things until they are in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10531)|
| 2:55:38| neighborhood or in the area of concern for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| And a lot of people, it seems to be, in particular for Knoxville, seems to be a common thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10543)|
| 2:55:51| And that's when it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| And that's when the lack of policy, the lack of intent is noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| And it's always the people who have the least political power, the least amount of voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10560)|
| 2:56:08| Everybody has a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Just the least amount of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| All the ones that get the most negatively affected by all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| And just me hanging around for the last 25 years, trying to do things in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| and stuff, this always seems to be a common thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| And, you know, I just take some of that, take some of those dollars that you find for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10586)|
| 2:56:36| other issue, concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| Go find some dollars so you can sit down and talk to Department of Transportation officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10598)|
| 2:56:46| in D.C. and TDOT folk and work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10606)|
| 2:56:52| Find some incentives to build a terminal that Greyhound, if they want to come in and utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10612)|
| 2:57:00| it, they can if they, you know, pay the going rate, whatever, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| But there are other private carriers out here that could benefit from a freestanding Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10625)|
| 2:57:14| public transportation terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| Could be added on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| You could do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| Do your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10640)|
| 2:57:20| Do some proper planning like you always do with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| It's not that hard, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| Well, in some cases, Tommy, maybe, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| Second thing, Mayor, you got to quit, split the legal services representatives from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10650)|
| 2:57:38| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| Don't have them representing conflicting interest entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| You've got a lawyer representing, who represents the police department, also representing PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10665)|
| 2:57:52| Makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10672)|
| 2:57:55| Find someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| Please, find someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Please, find someone so that PARC's interests and their agenda and their purpose in being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10679)|
| 2:58:07| is properly represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| You can't have a review committee and a slight oversight committee for the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10690)|
| 2:58:18| being served by the same, and they can't be served by the same legal representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| That doesn't make sense, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| And one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221213?start=10708)|
