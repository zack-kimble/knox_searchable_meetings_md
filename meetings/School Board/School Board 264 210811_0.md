| 0:00:35| Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=35)|
| 0:01:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=60)|
| 0:01:21| Welcome to the Board of Education's August 11th regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| I don't think we have any elected officials in the audience, but thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| The board met in executive session with representatives from the Knox County Law Department this afternoon at 4.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| Mr. Doopler, would you mind sharing information regarding executive session meetings for the public's information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| Sure, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| So, an executive session is the law director's opportunity to have a conversation with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| It is one of the few exceptions to the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| It is not an opportunity for the board to deliberate, which did not occur, but we did have a session to discuss pending litigation and possible litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| and that was under Smith County Education v. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you, Mr. Doopler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| And just a couple of announcements for upcoming meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| The Naming Facilities Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, August 23rd at 9.30 a.m. in the first floor boardroom of the Andrew Johnson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=141)|
| 0:02:31| and the Joint Education Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, August 25th at 4 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson Building boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| Also, board members, as we begin our discussion this evening, I would like to apologize for allowing too much free exchange between board members last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=161)|
| 0:02:53| It can be challenging when this is the only conversation we have in this setting and mediated by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| However, we must be respectful toward one another, so please be sure to wait until you are recognized before speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| My goal is always to ensure that all board members are able to articulate their thoughts and ask their questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| and I'm sure with our agenda this evening that several folks will have comments and questions they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| so please make your comments brief so that everybody has an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| and so I would just request that you make sure that you are recognized by the chair before you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Are there any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Yes, and I'm going to pass this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| I would like to add a motion to the agenda to be voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| I move that the Board of Education vote to mandate masks while inside Knox County school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| and on buses for students, staff, and visitors at the elementary and middle schools in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| until FDA has given the emergency authorization of the COVID vaccine to children 12 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| Teachers that can be at least six feet away from students while teaching can remove their masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=249)|
| 0:04:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| If I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| If we can just have quiet in the boardroom so that we can conduct our meeting, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I think I heard a second from Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Discussion on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Mr. McMillan, you have discussion on adding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Do you have your light on, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. McMillan, you did have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Can you use your mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| While we're setting the agenda, I guess this would be the appropriate place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| I would like to make a motion to remove 9D from the agenda, from tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=315)|
| 0:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| We have a motion to remove 9B from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| It's not 9B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| It's a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| And Ms. Bounds seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Ms. Henderson is calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Will we have to vote on the changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Can we just do it for risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| If that's what we're going to do, that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| So, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| I mean, as far as calling for the question, I mean, you know, it sounds to me like, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| mean, you're not done trying to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| So, you've got two motions on the floor now to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| Those two motions are going to have to be voted on at this point, because there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| So, the call for the question, I don't think is in order at this point, unless you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| a second and you specify which one you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| Now, you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I'm sure you will, but Ms. Babb's making an entirely new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=413)|
| 0:07:04| The motion I made was in regard to one that's already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| Number two, when somebody calls for the question on an item that has a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=430)|
| 0:07:22| all debate stops, and you vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| So, you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| What I'm saying is, that doesn't mean that you continue discussing anybody that has their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| When somebody calls for the question on a motion that's on the floor, then you vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Now, if it gets voted down, well, you can go wherever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| So, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| So, I mean, if Ms. Henderson is calling for the question on your motion, is that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| So, with that specificity, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I mean, you know, the board can now have a vote to call for the question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| So, we will vote on the question, which is before the board, which is to Mr. McMillan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| motion to remove item 90 from our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Are you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| You're voting to call for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| So, we're not voting to remove the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| So, you're voting to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I have a procedural question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Ms. Owen, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| I'm confused about removing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| If we're voting to remove one, did we vote to add one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| We have not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| So, Ms. Babb's motion is still on the table, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| You were taking motions to alter the agenda, and now there's been a motion to call for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| the question on one particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| That doesn't remove Ms. Babb's item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Ms. Babb's item is still on the table, but there's a call for the question on Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| McMillan's removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Would Mr. McMillan's removal make it possible to discuss Ms. Babb's item as that topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=557)|
| 0:09:29| They're completely on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Because it was not noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Ms. Babb's item, I mean, can be discussed because there's a motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| So, we're not, and Ms. Babb has made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=580)|

| 0:09:46| So, we're not voting on her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| We're voting on whether to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So, Mr. McMillan made a motion after the fact, so we have to deal with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| McMillan's motion and then go back to Ms. Babb's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| So, that is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| With all due respect, I believe that when the question is called for, you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=604)|
| 0:10:14| to vote on whether you want to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| When the question is called for, it's either voted up or down or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Am I wrong, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I mean, Mr. McMillan, I mean, the way the board used to operate was if you called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| the question, then everything would stop, but that's not traditional Roberts rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| and a couple of years ago, the board voted to adopt the more traditional Roberts rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| So, you do have to vote on calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| So, we need to go ahead and vote on calling for the question in regard to Mr. McMillan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| motion to remove 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| So, we're calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Voting is called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| All in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Which just means shutting down discussion and voting on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| So, any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Well, you bet you we'd come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| We're going to come back to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| So, any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| We've had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=668)|

| 0:11:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Now, we will go back to Mr. McMillan's motion, which is to remove item 9D, and we had a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| from Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=683)|

| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| So, now we're ready to vote for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Let's do a roll call vote, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=699)|

| 0:12:14| And now, we go back to Ms. Babb's motion, which was seconded by Ms. Satterfield, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| this is to add an agenda item that Ms. Babb read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| So, this is in regard to adding this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=748)|

| 0:12:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=767)|

| 0:16:09| I mean, yes, I'm making it in the form of a motion to add to the agenda, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| And you're doing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| My intent was to do it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| That was my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| That's the way I thought I was framing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| I was not clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| So, we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Babb regarding adding board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| And then a motion by Mr. Watson, and do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| So, we have a second by Mr...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Oh, a motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Now, do we have discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| They're two separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| So, we have two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| We have one from Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Any discussion on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1015)|

| 0:17:11| We're going to go to Mr. Watson's motion since it was made most recently, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| go back to Ms. Satterfield's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| So, Mr...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| So, you'd like to vote on hers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| We can deal with that one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| That's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| So, is there discussion on Ms. Satterfield's motion to add board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I just want to be sure that all the board members understand that we are not voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| on the motion themselves, but on adding them to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| We're still on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| I'm sure there's not any confusion there, but we're just adding them to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| We're still on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So, is there any discussion on Ms. Satterfield's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| All it consists of is adding board forum at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1081)|

| 0:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1088)|

| 0:18:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So, we'll add board forum to the end of this evening's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| And then, Mr. Watson, would you like to go ahead and just officially make your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| You want to read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1104)|

| 0:18:29| I apologize for not being clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I'm asking to add a motion to authorize the director of schools to implement layered prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| strategies regarding COVID-19 that align with the guidance for the Center for Disease and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1116)|

| 0:18:50| and visitors while indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| This guidance may change in several ways as the year progresses based on community transmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| rates for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1135)|

| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| And Ms. Owen has seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| So, we're not voting on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| We're voting on whether we're adding it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Is everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Do you have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| They don't have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1152)|

| 0:19:18| Yes, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| I can't vote for this for the simple reason that it deals with the CDC and they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1161)|
| 0:19:31| all over the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| We're just voting on adding it to the agenda, not on the motion itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Well, if you add it to the agenda, you know, I'm just telling you why I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| You know, because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I guess I'll shut up and we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| I'm going to make something clear for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| If we do not put this on the agenda, then our public forum speakers will be moved to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| the end of our board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And I just want people to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| That's how procedurally that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you, Ms. Babin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I would note that if there is something that a board member would like to change semantically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| in the motion, that we can only do that if it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I appreciate the opportunity to always potentially add something to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| I think this is a topic that the public wants discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| I think that's why we have many people in our audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| I can tell you that in the last week since our last discussion on this issue, I've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| 395 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| And I think this is something that the public is curious about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| So, I hope that the board gives deference to the issue and that we're able to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1255)|

| 0:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1283)|

| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1292)|

| 0:26:06| D, related to grants and what are some of the ways that Knox County Schools is supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| our students who are experiencing homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1571)|
| 0:26:21| Dr. Reisig or Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Dr. Reisig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| So, usually I would turn it over to Ms. Cook, who is actually out of town tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| So, I can try to give you some particulars of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Just in general, too, Mr. Reisig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I just think it's important for the public to understand that we do have students in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| our schools that are experiencing homelessness, and what are some of the ways that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Schools is specifically trying to help support those students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| No, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So, we do, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| So, there's a couple things we do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| If a student is considered homeless, then we let them stay in their last zoned school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| that they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| So, what we know is sometimes there are different places where a student may be if they're homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| or assigned temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| So, we don't make them move zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| We try to keep everything as normal as possible for those students who are experiencing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| So, they stay in their zoned school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| And then we also have different types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| We provide social workers that are there to help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| We help with transportation, and some of these grants pay for cap bus passes, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| sorts of things for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Part of this grant is a homeless social worker liaison that works with those families to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| try to help them get them the services that they need as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| So, we do work within the individual school to make sure they have the supports for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Tutoring is another part that we provide out of this grant as well for students who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1667)|

| 0:31:04| Okay, we have a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I'll take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| We have Ms. Satterfield has made a motion, Mr. Watson seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| So, just for the public, this actually equates to an 8% total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| Is that right, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Yes, sir, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| And I think it's also important for the public to understand that although we're giving these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| categories of employees an 8% raise, which is fantastic and more than what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| getting, it's still not nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| So, Mr. McPherson, can you speak to just a minute about what the general salary ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| are for those positions at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I know I'm hitting you with this cold, but 8% to some folks sounds like a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| amount of money, which, again, is good and I'm all for this, but I also want the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| to understand that there's still work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I'll talk in really very general range here, and Scott can correct me if I'm wrong, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| obviously it can vary depending on the steps that one is on, but maybe a good midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| would be $25,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Does that sound right, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| And is that before or after the 8%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| But, again, it could vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| These are different employee types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| But I think probably educational assistance, probably average, probably could be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| bit lower than that even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Both of these employee groups would average under $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| 9B, 9C, and 9D were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1975)|

| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| We have a motion by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I heard a second from Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Heard a couple of seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| I just wanted to say I'm really thankful for this money, for this framework, for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I would love to see a monthly update, kind of like how the superintendent does his update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Maybe we could do an ESSER funding update each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| That way we can see what's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| We can stay on top of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| The public knows what's going on with these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And that way we can be proactive if we need to change or update anything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| We have such a short time to spend this money, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| And so I just want to make sure that we're implementing it in the correct ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| And I'd love to see a dedicated staff member who wakes up thinking about this, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| who's following the data, following the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| We don't want it to be four or five years out and our students still be behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| But I'm really excited about this money and everything that the staff has done to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| these programs together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Ms. Roswick, and you might have covered this last week, but you covered so much that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| might have missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| What is the timeline if we should approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Where does it go from here, and when do we actually see being able to start hiring some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| of these positions, that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| So the submission date is by August the 27th, and the state has a 30-day turnaround to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| us know if there are adjustments we need to make to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We'll probably submit a little before that just so we can get that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| But once they approve in those 30 days, then the money could be spent at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| So the funds have to be exhausted by September of 2024, which means they're not allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| but actually exhausted, spent down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So we're working right now on some of those things, because a lot of what we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| last week are kind of three-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Some of those are year two, year three, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| So we're working on trying to build a timeline out for that, also trying to be cognizant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| of what school load is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| If all this money hits and it's spendable in a month, we can't download that all on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| principals and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| So we're trying to be mindful of that, too, as we roll stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| But there's a lot we're excited about in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Because some of those things are things that we might have to put an RFP out for and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| through that process, which could take multiple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| So we've kind of told principals that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Here are the big ideas of what we're going to do, and we'll try to communicate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| timelines better as far as what happens first and second as we get closer on the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| But it sounds like it could be as early as October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I mean, I realize it's going to take a while to get stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| We talked a lot about tutoring in there and kind of thought through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Ms. Jackson and I had a conversation with the State Department yesterday, and it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| like that our model is one that they're interested in to be able to allow us the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| to be part of the TNL Corps, which is good for us, and we wanted to make sure it worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| for us locally and that we had some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| And they seem to be verbally confident they still have to approve the plan that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| So I think it's something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| We want to make sure we, and we told them this as well, that we hire the folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| we need and we properly train those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So that may be more like a spring of 2022 before we start, you know, turning them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| to schools and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| So, I mean, it makes sense in those timelines, but we will try to put, you know, some timelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| And I like Ms. Henderson's suggestion of regular report outs to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| I would say, you know, we could maybe kind of see what that looks like month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| It may not look very exciting, but if we at least did quarterlies or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| to give you that, I think we definitely could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Thank you, Dr. Reisbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Ms. Henderson, I think, brought up a great point and you talked about somebody waking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| up every morning who's thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Dr. Reisbeck, I know there's been some conversation about needing to hire some support staff just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| to help manage these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Can you, do we have a sense of what that load is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| So, a couple ways we've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And so, I know Cheryl Martin, who's over our federal programs, you know, we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| about that within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| She has a lot of folks who are in her department right now who do a lot of the federal processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| So, as we've talked through the monitoring on that side, like the fiscal monitoring and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| the dollar monitoring, you know, her working with Ron in finance, I think there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| there's kind of some clerical positions that they may extend some of their hours that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| part-time maybe to full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| But we really tried to be conscientious about not spending that money at the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| but really pushing out to the schools where we could get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| So, she feels initially that they've got the capacity because, again, they, I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| guys know because you approve it, they handle millions and millions of dollars every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| that go through it, that go out to schools through all of our titles, 1, 2, 3, and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| that they handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| And so, they feel they have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| They have, you know, an accountant on staff that, again, works with our finance side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| So, they feel pretty good about that right now that they can do it with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| What Ms. Henderson alluded to about someone on the data tracking side, I mean, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| probably work with Steve Rutter and our REA team at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| We have not at this point put dollars aside to have someone dedicated just to that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| But I know Steve Rutter wouldn't turn that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| I agree with Ms. Henderson that regular report outs would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| And I think, you know, as we have outcomes that associate with the way we're spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| those dollars, that would be good to include in those report outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| And just for the public, just so you all know, if you want to see the full presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| if you want to hear it, you can go back and watch the video of Dr. Rise who did an amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| But you can also access that presentation and that summary on our board agenda on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| Knox County website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Do we know, Ms. Harrington, is there going to be anything on the Knox County website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| in the future that is something related to ESSER funding that either holds the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| presentation or some opportunity for update to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| I'm sure there's still a lot to be considered, but is that something that's being considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| We're just kind of waiting to see, you know, the action of the board this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you, Dr. Rise and Ms. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Item 9F is consideration of Mr. Watson's motion to authorize the Director of Schools to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| layered prevention strategies regarding COVID-19 that align with the guidance from the Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| for Disease Control and Prevention, including but not limited to contact tracing, quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| physical distancing, additional cleaning, and universal masking for all students, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| staff, and visitors while indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| This guidance may change in several ways as the year progresses based on community transmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| rates for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| We have a motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Ms. Babb, I think we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Jennifer Mendoza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| And if you'll state your name and county of residence, then you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| My name is Jennifer Mendoza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I have an elementary age student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| When I signed up to speak, I thought my objective tonight was to add my voice in favor of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| precautions in our schools to encourage action on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| After watching meetings where the COVID protocols were sunset, last week's meeting, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| this one, I am discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| How do we talk about this if we can't even agree on the basics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| But I ask that we try to understand each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| First, I want you to know that even though some do not want to talk about April anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| April is important for us as parents because that was our deadline for choosing in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| versus virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| When we committed to send our second grader to school in person this fall, COVID precautions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| in schools appeared to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| COVID case counts were steadily decreasing, and the school board was voting to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| We were told that we could not change our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| We decided to trust that you would follow the guidance of medical experts if the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| So now, my question is, with the spread of the Delta variant, case counts increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| dramatically, children under 12 unable to be vaccinated, and the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| of Health, CDC, and American Academy of Pediatrics all recommending universal masking in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| regardless of vaccination status, because Delta is that contagious, in combination with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| other protections, why aren't you following their recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| And if we're being honest, we all know that the only way to achieve universal masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| is with a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| By choosing not to enact mask requirements, you're taking a risk for the sake of normality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| So my next question is, what is the acceptable cost for you to be free from masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| Is there a point where enough kids will be sick that there will be a mask requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| As a concerned parent, I'd like to know, where are those benchmarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| And in the sake of transparency and informed decision making, will COVID case counts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| schools be reported to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| So yes, as it was mentioned in the meeting last week, many parents are confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| We are also now between a rock and a hard place without other feasible schooling options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| for our family, and we feel betrayed, worried, and angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| I absolutely do not mean to be disrespectful, but we have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| Why are schools able to enforce a dress code that arguably has nothing to do with student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| safety, but not masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Why has our children's health become political?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Let's all respect our speakers on whatever they're speaking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Why is masking framed as just an individual choice when it absolutely affects other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| The risk of transmission is much lower when we all mask up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| The CDC has made a cost-benefit analysis and has decided that it is worth it for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and everyone around them to wear masks in combination with other COVID protocols and precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| The Tennessee Department of Health is echoing their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| And why is there so much animosity here towards the experts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Medical guidelines change as we learn more about an evolving virus, and that is the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| way science and medicine work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| We are all concerned about making up the COVID learning deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Wearing masks and COVID protocols are better than mass absences, shutting schools down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| or going virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Isn't our first goal to provide a safe environment so that children can learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| You could say that I'm being hyperbolic, that the mortality rate for children has been close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| to zero so far, and that there wasn't much COVID transmission in schools last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| But that was Alpha, and now we have Delta, an unknown without any of the protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| in our schools that we had against Alpha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Parents are worried, and more will become worried as case counts rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Delta is more contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| It is affecting more children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| By numbers alone, that means more children will be hospitalized, potentially maxing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| pediatric ICU capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Knoxville has been spared from a major surge so far, and I hope that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| But there are surges across the South now, and hospitals are filling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| It would be horrible to need additional care for your child and not be able to access it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| because resources are scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Further, there is more to measure than just the mortality rate among children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| We could see more cases of the inflammatory syndrome that occurs weeks after COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| and we won't have data on that for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| We could see COVID long-haul our kids with heart issues, brain fog, and fatigue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| We don't know yet the true long-term effects of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| On Monday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee spoke about how the local school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| had the authority to enact COVID protocols including masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| Other counties here have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| UT has already done that for university students that can already be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Why are we not giving that same protection to the children in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| especially children who cannot get that vaccine themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Our children need universal masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I'm pleading with you to enact COVID health protocols again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2737)|

| 0:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2751)|

| 0:45:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| I should've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| We're going to be here a long time tonight if we can't move through our speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| and I think we all want to hear every single one of our speakers that's come here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| and I should've said this before we started public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| We have different people coming with different views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Please, as an audience, be very respectful for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| of the members and let them get through their five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| or however long they're speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Heather Carroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2775)|
| 0:46:26| And please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I have a trustee assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| Is this okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| Or do you want us to just let it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| Heather Carroll, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| I'm here again today to say that I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| that masks remain optional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| and let's keep it a parental choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| With all due respect to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| you and I do not co-parent together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I alone with my husband, we decide what is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| You cannot tell me that you are more concerned with the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| of my child than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| In speaking tonight, I want to keep the main thing the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| thing and that is that mask mandates are pointless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| as masks do not prevent the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| and the contraction of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| While I truly believe, like the lady that just spoke before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| there are well-meaning yet misinformed parents trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| to do the best for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Trust me, COVID is not the issue I thought I was ever going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| to take on, yet here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| I will always stand in the gap for my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| and stand for what is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| And what is true is that our kids deserve to be kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Our kids deserve to go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| and see their teacher's facial expressions to learn and to laugh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| and to communicate with their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| without the barrier of a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| As I stated last week, masks are actually more harmful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| to our children and they do not stop the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| There is study after study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Doctors across all specialties have proven and concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| that masks do not prevent you from contracting COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Teaching institutions such as Johns Hopkins, Stanford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Harvard, even the CDC have said masks potentially have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| probability or potentially could stop COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| but potentially means possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| But there's no scientific data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| What is proven, like I stated last week, is that the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| of a COVID particle can infiltrate the cloth mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| that our kids would wear to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| They do not prevent us and our children from getting COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| In a recent article on the effectiveness of masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| it states the CDC admitting in a recent report said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| that mask mandates merely, as I just said, have the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| but not the science to slow the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| You can check this on the CDC website, which is interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| because the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2939)|
| 0:48:59| of potential literally means existing impossibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| We have to ask ourselves, are we following facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| or are we being motivated by fear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| When we're listening to the narrative from the news medias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| on our social media, it is fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| It is, you hear statements and headlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| like the Knoxville cases have risen 200% but as I've listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| out on these poster boards in front of me, even though our case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| our active cases have risen since last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| it has not changed hospitalizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| It has not increased deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| An active case as defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| by the World Health Organization states a probable, suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| or confirmed case of COVID, it does not mean hospitalizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| and it does not mean a death sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Our children deserve to go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2980)|

| 0:49:44| And as their parent, I know what is best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| With all due respect, you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| And to put a mask mandate in place is not okay with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and a lot of other parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| We should be encouraged by the facts of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| We should be encouraged that even though cases rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| the death mortality rate stays low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| which means you have a very high percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| of recovery from this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| And as I stated last week, if you are not a high risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| or do not have a high risk medical condition as a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| then you almost have a zero chance of dying from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| There are 650 pediatric auto accident deaths every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| You have more of a risk of your child dying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| in your car driving them to and from school than you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| from them contracting COVID and dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| But what we're not talking about is the anxiety and the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| and the learning loss and the behavioral issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| that have popped up from wearing these masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| It is time to put this to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| I would implore this board to truly look at the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| and not listen to the anecdotal cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| but to the fact I do not discount anyone's real fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| or what they may have experienced personally with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| But it is time to put this to an end so you as the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| can get back to matters that truly mean something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| to the school board, like our curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| and educating our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I implore you once again, keep masks optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Here's another thing, if you mandate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| you take away my choice to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| what is best for my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Keeping masks optional allows those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| that want to mask their children to still make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| We live in a country where we should have body autonomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| and free choice, and not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| that the science proves masks do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you, Mabry Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3083)|
| 0:51:32| Mabry Shields, oh, sorry, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Mabry, if you'd state your name and what county you live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| and you will have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| My name is Mabry Grace Shields, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| I'm a sixth grader at Halls Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I want to speak with you about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Last week, the board held firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| on no mask mandates this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| This is a constantly changing area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| and I want you to hear from one of the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| that this directly affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Last year, we complied with the mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| There were schools all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| that did not have mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| and their cases were no different than where kids were masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| This year, we know more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| and we know that kids are not at risk from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| If we get it, we bounce back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| just like kids have been for centuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| As of July 19, 2021, 335 minors nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| have died of COVID-19 in almost 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| and the CDC is recalling tests that are not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and the CDC also notes that 35% of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| could have had nothing to do with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| In addition, every minor who has died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| has had a significant underlining of medical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| such as leukemia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| These were sick kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Not one single healthy kid has been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| as dying from COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Contrast this with approximately 450 minor deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| from flu in any given year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| which, by the way, is 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| compared to 18th month COVID data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| So what does this mean to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| It means that this is highly unlikely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| that COVID-19 in any form is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| the cause of my death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| So 335 deaths in 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Looking at CDC numbers from 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| did you know that 995 minors die from drowning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| So maybe we should ban swimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| but no, that won't work because a child can drown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| in two inches of water in a bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| So maybe we ban water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| That doesn't make any sense, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| 4,074 minors die in vehicle accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| so maybe we don't let anyone drive anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| This is about how much sense masks make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| The only way to completely protect us is to not breathe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| There are all sorts of stuff in the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| that can make us sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| but with hygiene and good health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| my body fights most of it off without me even knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| I'm not afraid of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| If I get sick, I'll get treatment if I need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| and take care of myself and get well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| If I was afraid of dying from COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| then I should be terrified of swimming or riding in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Those are way more dangerous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Did you know in 2016, there were 2,335 suicides by minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| The risk of children committing suicide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| during normal conditions is nearly 10 times higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| than the risk of death from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| It is widely known that kids have been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| a lot mentally from masks, isolation, and lockdowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and suicides by kids went up during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| One of my brother's friends committed suicide last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| after being stuck at home for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| It is very real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| I do not understand why grownups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| seem to be so determined to scare us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| to make us afraid, to isolate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Teach things like good hygiene, proper etiquette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| like coughing into your elbow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| and generally, how to be clean and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| I traveled all over the country this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| When I came back from Mexico,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| we had to pay to have a COVID test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| and have papers to come back to my country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| But the border is open and hundreds of thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| are coming with no papers and no tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| and they aren't coming home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| They're coming illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| But no one is concerned if they are sick or carrying COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| but yet people want to mask school children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| If I'm 11 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and I can see that this doesn't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| then I really can't understand how so many grownups don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| If you want to continue to ignore the nonsense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| that is your choice, but please stop trying to scare us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| We want to live our lives fully and with joy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and friends and family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| to not be miserable in a hot, wet, smelly mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Personally, one of my greatest attributes is my smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| And last year, you made me lose a huge part of myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| when you took my ability to share my smile with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Please stop playing politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| and fear-mongering with our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Wear a mask if you choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| but don't make us if we don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you for your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| and please continue to stick up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3370)|

| 0:56:20| and state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| Just a little bit taller than her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| My name is Amber Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Anthropologist Margaret Mead was once asked by a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| what she considered to be the first sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| of civilization in a culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| The student expected Mead to talk about clay pots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| tools for hunting, grinding stones, or religious artifacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| But Mead said the first evidence of civilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| was a 15,000 years old fractured femur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| found in an archeological site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| She explained that because it takes six weeks of rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| to heal a fractured femur in societies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| without the benefits of modern medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| this was evidence that another person had taken time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| to stay with the fallen, had bound up the wound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| had carried the person to safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| and had tended to them through recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| A healed femur indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| that someone has helped a fellow human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| rather than abandoning them to save their own life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| So I start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| We have come very, very far in our modern capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| but as we've advanced, I feel our compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| our empathy, our kindness is dwindling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Our willingness to protect the young, the innocent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| the helpless, the sick, and afflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| and even ourselves in society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| has clearly become unimportant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And where that dwindles in society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| society begins to crumble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| As a parent, I have a responsibility to my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| My responsibility to keep them safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| is why I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| My responsibility to my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| is why I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| And while I hope to become more and more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| in other matters regarding school business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| I believe our children's health and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| at this time of this year is where we should be focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| when there's concern about that possibly being threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| My daughter has learned the following in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| We take care of ourselves, we take care of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| and we take care of our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| As individuals, we are responsible for our own actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| As we share this beautiful earth with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| we have a responsibility to them to be civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| to be kind, and have difficult conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| when it is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| And as a county school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| you have the responsibility to take care of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| and the current health environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| You may not have anticipated the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| when you ran for a seat on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| If you didn't anticipate that, you'd be really surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| But I ask you now, as parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| we are doing our part to ensure our children's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Will you as board members of the Knox County School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| accept your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| to face what the experts have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| and what our children deserve and create a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| for masks until this pandemic subsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| or better yet, is gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| And I might add that the CDC, in science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| you never list 100% because that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| There is a reason for that wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| and that is because of the probability of the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| that something might happen and that might not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| But the science is clear on this matter and masks do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| If we don't take on the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| to protect our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| then that places the responsibility squarely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| on their shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| When in the history of the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| has anything like this been left up to children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Children do best in a structured environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| with boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| There is confusion for them when it is a free-for-all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| and the stress increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| It is not a structured environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| There is confusion in what the rules are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| and it is not unifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| This is an opportunity to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| what we hope they will eventually learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| that separating truth from misinformation is vital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and taking care of others means we progress further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| than we could if we only take care of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| It is an opportunity to display to this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| that this is a district that believes in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| that we believe in thinking critically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| It's an opportunity to look bullies in the eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| and speak up about what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| Children are resilient, that is scientifically proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| That resilience comes from factors in the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| the family and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| and through routines in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| like school and religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| The mental trade-off of wearing masks to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| compared to virtual schools at home alone is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| They do better in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| These cloth coverings are a tool to normalize life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| for the vast majority of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| whatever their circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| It is the kind thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| because we are not doing it just for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| We are doing it for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We need to show that we take care of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I speak for all of us when I say that we're tired of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| We don't wanna be doing this anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| and it's possible we wouldn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| but the hard thing, the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| is to utilize this authority that this board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| to make decisions about masks and other mitigation efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| It is time to accept your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| and help our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Helping someone else through difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| is where civilization starts, Margaret Mead said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| the anthropologist and archeologist I referred to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| committed citizens can change the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I'm gonna have to stop you, but thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Vera Digert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| And please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3701)|
| 1:01:52| and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| My name is Vera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I have a son who attends public elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I'm here to ask you to reconsider the mask policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| and institute a mask requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| for students and staff that is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| with recommendations of not only the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| but also the American Academy of Pediatrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| and the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| The current recommendation is that schools implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| universal mask requirements in order to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| in-person learning while keeping kids and staff safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| The concern here is not just about safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| but the right of my child and all the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| in the school district to continue attending school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| in person without interruptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Without a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| it's likely that schools will experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| large preventable outbreaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Does the board have a plan for what will happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| if schools experience outbreaks or a large percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| of teachers or staff are out sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Will we need to shut down the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| And will parents be forced to leave work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| to watch their kids because their schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| are not able to stay open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| because they don't have sufficient staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| or because their kids are sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Keeping kids in school is critical for the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| of both the kids and the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| and in-person learning is supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| by the American Academy of Pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| for school plans should start with the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| of keeping students safe and physically present in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| due to the negative mental health impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| of remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| The board's current policy of not requiring masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| undermines the goal of keeping schools fully open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| and staffed and is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| with every medical recommendation that I am aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| including my own children's pediatrician's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| The message that your current policy sends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| is that this board does not care about in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| The message of the sense is that the board does not care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| about students' mental and physical wellbeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| And sadly, the board, the message of the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| is that the board hasn't thought through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| the short and long-term implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| When I called my school to ask what preventative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| they're taking to prevent the spread of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| they said that they are asking students to wash their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| How will washing hands prevent the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| of an airborne virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| It's nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Masking is a reasonable ask of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| so that kids can continue schooling in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and parents can protect their livelihoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| and not have to leave work to watch their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| because schools can't stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| We already require kids to be vaccinated to attend school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| We ask that they wash their hands at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| We require that they come to school wearing clothes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| and shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Why is a mask any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| On Monday, Governor Lee said that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| that the laws are set up in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| school districts have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| to institute mask requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| The governor is telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| that you have the legal authority to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And so again, I ask the board to act consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| with the current medical recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| and implement a universal mask requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| to ensure that our kids can continue learning in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| and without interruptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3907)|
| 1:05:07| Um, Kayliana Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3907)|
| 1:05:26| Is she wanting to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Yeah, she can just do it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Is she on a microphone or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Hold on, let me check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| You don't want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3936)|
| 1:05:36| You don't have to, you don't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Do you want to sit here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Do you want to sit here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| You want to do it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Okay, Kayliana, can you tell us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Kayliana Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Do you want to speak to us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Where do you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3958)|
| 1:05:58| Where do you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Knox County, she lives in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Just look at Miss Betsy and Miss Patty, you know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Okay, go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I'll talk after you, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Okay, I think, you don't want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Okay, she doesn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3977)|
| 1:06:17| There's a lot of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Hilary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3982)|
| 1:06:22| I'm Hilary Godsey and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| I'll just say what she wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| because she was practicing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| but she wanted to thank everybody for taking off the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| She had a great first three days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| and she loved seeing her friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| So that was all that she was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| As for me, I wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| if you call the health department right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| they have no tests for the Delta variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| So there's not any real numbers coming from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| When we're talking about the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| they keep saying recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And if we look at the definition of recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| it's to suggest an act or course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| The definition of suggest is to offer for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| The CDC also suggests that you don't eat raw fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| And I know a lot of people that eat sushi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| It also says not to eat raw cookie dough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| I eat raw cookie dough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| That is something that you are taking as a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| but you're making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| And as one of the speakers said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| we're not trying to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| everyone's ability to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| I think if you want to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| that you should wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| If you feel that it's safe for your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| and that's what's best for your children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| then put a mask on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I want you to do what's best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| You know them better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| You know them better than any of the board members do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| But what's being asked of tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| is that we put masks on every single kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| My child was sick last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| from headaches and stomach aches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| and it was directed back at the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| So this year, she will not be wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Even if it's put forward that you guys want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| I will have a doctor's note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| because my child gets sick from masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Your child may get sick without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Put it on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| But I think we're crossing a really dark line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| if we mandate it and make everybody do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| I'm not sure, but I don't think any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| are my daughter's pediatrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And I consult with my pediatrician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| because my pediatrician knows my child and I know my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| What it also, I think, comes down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| we keep talking about the masks and we talk about COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| but I think we have a bigger problem here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| when it comes to communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| And between the district office and the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| and the principals and the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| the communication is absolutely horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| And I think we need to focus more on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| than on if we're masking or not masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| And back, the superintendent had said in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| that we would be going back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| So as parents, we see that as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| okay, we're gonna be allowed back in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| We're gonna be able to not have masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| We're not gonna have any of the temperature checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| But there's a lot of schools right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| they don't have walkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| I'm not allowed to go in my daughter's school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| for lunch anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| because they're still distancing the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| And it's in regards to behavior, they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| but I don't trust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| There's other schools that are doing it and saying behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| How am I, what do I know to trust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Because it's been said this whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| that that's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| In PE, she just told me this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| that yesterday in PE, they distanced three feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| because that way they wouldn't get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| So are we back to normal or are we not back to normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| The principals can make their own decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| and I love my principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I love my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I love my faculty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| but I'm just really confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| as to who is in charge of certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And I think that needs to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| at the top of the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And I think if that gets worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| a lot of this other stuff would get worked out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Thank you, Matt Blackman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4194)|
| 1:10:04| If you'll state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Good evening, I'm Matt Blackman from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| I would echo the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| I would request no cheers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| I'm unlikely to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| And please no booze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| I am a fragile daffodil with a gentle ego.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| That's supposed to be funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| See, I don't know, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I don't know how y'all do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| My name is Matt Blackman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| and I'm a proud resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| I was born in Maryville at Blount Memorial Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| I'm also a proud parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| My daughter just moved to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Please don't ask me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| I will cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| After graduating from Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| as one of the only students in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| to make a perfect 36 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| My son is an eighth grader at West Valley, all honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| I know a little bit about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| I also know a little bit about community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| I've served locally as a baseball coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| and a commissioner in a local little league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I've served on the board of local PTSAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| PTOs, PTSOs and other acronyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| And I'm also currently on the board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| of one of our local education foundations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| that returns tens of thousands of dollars per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| in support of our local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| I know a little bit about community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| I've also been a past substitute teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| I've taught as a professor full and part time for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| from the community college level all the way to Penn State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| So I know about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| My job is not to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| what other people say are the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| My job is I am a healthcare informaticist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| which nobody knows what that means, not even me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| What that means is I deal with data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| All the bits and numbers and parts and pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| and statistics that we all throw at each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| that's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| It explains why I don't get invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| to a lot of parties, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| I have been, that's another funny thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| You're a tough crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| I have been working COVID response since January, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| Yes, since January, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Because as a data scientist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| I saw the national statistics and trends in data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Now I say all that drivel to give you a background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| on why I come to bother you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Tonight, I come to echo the warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| of the professionals in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| People who actually deal with the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| The doctors, the data scientists, the physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| the physical therapists like my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| who is now dealing with post COVID patients again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| The data released just today in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| shows that Delta is spreading at an uncontrolled rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| Let me repeat that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| It's spreading at an uncontrolled rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| It doesn't care what I think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| It doesn't care what I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| It doesn't care how it makes me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| The data is the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| We also learned today that in our 19 hospital region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| we have less than five ICU beds left available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Maybe even fewer, I didn't check before I walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Why does that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Well, if I get into a car accident on the way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| or if I have a heart attack or other major health issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| that means I may not be able to get care I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| If my father falls and breaks his hip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| he may have to wait in the ER a long enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| to set up infection before he gets care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| If any of my children get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| they may have to wait for a critical care bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Uncontrolled spread is a compelling threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| to us being able to finish in school education this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| We cannot go back to virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| We cannot go back to distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| You are committed to finishing in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Me too, it is critical to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| ABC Science Collaborative just yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| released the largest study on masking to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| They looked at 1 million real students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| The data is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Masking is the most effective way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| for in-person education to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Their conclusion matched the universal opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| of scientists and healthcare professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| I will read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Masking then is one of the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| most readily available methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| to protect children from any disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Universal masking being the most effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| We might talk a lot about death rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Lots of children don't die from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4479)|

| 1:15:20| Please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Good evening, Steve Rogers, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I have buried a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I looked at a mom while she wore a necklace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| that looked like this, that was on her son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| I saw what that pain was like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| I felt that pain when I read the eulogy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| and call me crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| but I don't want anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| to have to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| So that's why I'm saying what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| That's why I'm a little loud right now, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Those of you that know me know that I love a metaphor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| It's gonna take about a minute to set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Please humor me and follow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| I am an expert in contemporary percussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| I have performed, composed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| and instructed modern percussion techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| on two continents across language barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| at the highest levels in academic and non-academic settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| I feel very safe in saying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| and I can easily call up 50 people right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| in my very specific niche field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| that will attest to the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| that I am a top caliber professional resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| in the field of contemporary percussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| I also have degrees that directly feed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| and address my expertise in this very specific niche field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| A member of this school board is a part of the profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| that acknowledges the aforementioned claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| I qualify as an expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| in an exceptionally narrow, narrowly defined field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Beyond that, I am a highly educated person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| I hold multiple degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| considered outside of the niche field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| in my general professional field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| to also be a high quality resource of renown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| I've been told this by multiple current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| and former members of this very board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| So there's no person on the board qualified to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| that I am ignorant of the pedagogy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| of percussion instruction in contemporary music field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| especially in the competitive rudimental circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| So as an example, without Googling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| who here can tell me which of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| is not a professional term for my field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| Flam fly fa-fla, cheese that chudda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| parapotada, or Irish sevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| And yes, some of those are real, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| But you don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| because you're not an expert at what I do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| So I think no Instagram post, no radio pundit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| no person who is anti-percussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| can say that I'm not qualified for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I think everyone here can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| That's the setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Now, replace me, Steven Rogers, with an epidemiologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| Replace percussion with virology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| How do we suddenly just change our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| about what is an expert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| I don't understand how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| How can all of those points go out the window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| I ask because the virulent anti-public health decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| that are being made by an unfortunate number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| disagrees in that exact manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| I feel that someone is a quantifiable expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| peer-reviewed support backs it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| gives information to a recipient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| who, no matter the level of intelligence, elsewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| just doesn't understand that specific information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| at the necessary level of complexity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| That, we have outspoken defenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| against acknowledging that concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| that is straight out of Instagram posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| or from a radio pundit or anti-health public figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| and they're public, anti-public anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| That's embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| So Asa Hutchinson, governor of Arkansas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| did something recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| and I don't agree with the guy very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| but I gotta give him credit on this where credit is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| He exemplified mature learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| He changed his mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| when he was presented with better evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| which is also the scientific method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| a Tennessee state standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| He quite notably and publicly stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| that signing the bill that removed the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| from school boards to determine masking standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| was a mistake and he regrets signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| It takes a spine and it takes a moral conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| to admit a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| And I am deeply proud of him for that, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| His cross state tour to promote vaccination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| is something few other governors in his position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| have done or will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Ours, I understand that the political world is messed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| and that donors for person A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| might be donors for person B down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| if person B, you know, toes the line for person A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| I don't like that, but I know it's part of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| It's an unfortunate necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| and I stomach it from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| from both opponents and allies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| but I have never stomached it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| when the health and safety of children is on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| and I'm not starting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| I know enough about what I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| to realize I don't know enough about what I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And that's when I turn to experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| for surgery on my arm, to replace my transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| all of that, I go to experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| You come to me for percussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| don't go to your barber for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| I implore you, go to the epidemiologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| the virologists, the people who devoted centuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| of accumulated life's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| to studying and defeating disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| That information has been brought to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| by the wheelbarrow full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| much to the dismay of many a parlor account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| People have been coming before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| with claims that fail to meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| of truth or reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| and it's been given the same credence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| as analysis by experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Now, some folks have brought real data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| but the analysis wasn't strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| and that's a dramatic misinterpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| So here's a very famous thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| I know I've got very little time, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4807)|

| 1:20:10| You take a plane from World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| they've traced where all the bullets hit the fuselage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| and they're trying to see, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| where do we reinforce it to protect the plane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| You don't reinforce where the bullet holes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Those planes got back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| They didn't need the protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| It's the places that weren't hit with bullet holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| that you know goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| The guy that created operational research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Abraham Wald, came up with that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| That concept, we have got to be better than it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Justin Aft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4837)|
| 1:20:49| Please state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| I am Justin Aft, I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| I should say from the outset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| I do work at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| but anything I say here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| is entirely from my perspective as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| of three children in Knox County Elementary Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| In the spirit of adapting to changing situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| I had something I was gonna read tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| and decided to just respond to some of the other topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| that are still on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| but some of the motions that were brought up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| It is heartening that we are hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| some of these motions brought to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| to enable the superintendent to enact policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| based on guidance from experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| And that is really all I'm here to ask you to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| There is an abundant amount of guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| recommendations from the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| down to the local health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| including the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| It's abundantly available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I've been in touch with some of you about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| and sent you some of those links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| I encourage you to look carefully at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| because back in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| and I know that we don't wanna keep talking about April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| I want to keep talking about April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| because the board voted to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| It said, we will follow guidelines from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| And those guidelines were based heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| off of the CDC's own guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| And that was wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| That was a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| It was also a good thing to do to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| that you would adapt to changing situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| if you needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I can't do a justice to the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| like the gentleman just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| And those jokes were very funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| if you would see me smiling under my mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| But I do wanna point out a number from June 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| because on June 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| I remember feeling pretty good about the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| about the local situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Tests, some people know how many at bats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Cal Ripken had in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I know what the test positivity rates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| on a given day this summer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| But I was watching it because I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| you know what, things are getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| And I think we all felt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| I think we all anticipated that in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| when the board said, hey, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| we're gonna sunset this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| but we're also gonna keep an eye on situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| and we have guidelines that are ready made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| and we're gonna allow the superintendent to act on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Again, that was wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| In June, things were feeling better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Numbers were very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Case, their test positivity rate was 1.2% that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| That is kind of a managed crisis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Today, that is not the situation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| And I promised I wasn't gonna spout numbers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| but I do wanna reinforce those numbers from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| from the local health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| On July 3rd, which I looked at the day before the holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| because we all know that holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| have an effect on these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| There were eight people in ICUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| in the entire East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Today, there are 96 with only five rooms left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| So we cannot make the claim that the Delta variant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| is not having an effect on the local situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And I think we all also know that these increases in cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| these surges tend to happen and cluster around times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| when there are holidays, when there are breaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| or when there are times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| where we're all spending a lot of time indoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| with one another, maybe without precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| We know this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| We're three days into the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Our kids, there've gotta be thousands of classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Our kids are now simulating that indoor hangout environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| that we know causes surges thousands of times a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| five days a week for the unforeseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| We are going to contribute to a growing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| if we don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| The surge will get worse if we don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| I am asking you all to act on the very good guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| that you have at your fingertips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| the tools that the state of Tennessee is offering you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| the guidance that they are offering you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| and come up with a full layered strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| not just for masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| I don't, and I think that we've all lost sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| of some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| because masks are such a charged issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| What about contact tracing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| What about distancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| What about testing in schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| The state of Tennessee has guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| publicly available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| I've been reading them for the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| They have a lot of guidance and tools available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| And I would like to see the board act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| And I would like for the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| to have the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| which my understanding is that he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| to enact these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| and come up with a plan for what happens next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5132)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5136)|
| 1:25:44| I had not prepared to say anything tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| because I really feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I'm sorry, Laura Branson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Because I feel like we've all made our points both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| We know there are some who feel one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| and some who feel another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| However, it's evident, it's clear now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| that we cannot let this rest either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| because we have to come to a point as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| where we can come back together and agree on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| I wanted to thank Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| for last week, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| and to let him know that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| first of all, as parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| we appreciate the fact that you fought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| it has not been forgotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| that you fought really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| just to have our students back in schools last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| And that has made all the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I feel it has made all the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| to put us slightly ahead of other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| So please understand that we, as parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| We know your job is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| I know none of you has an easy job up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| You get emails, again, left and right, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| because I'm one of them, all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| whether you are for or against the masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| Today, I looked it up that on our health board's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| there are currently 39 sick children in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| 39 with COVID, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Or so they say with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| There are 1.7 million children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| in the entire state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Now, I'm all for the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| that it's the one child that we can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| It's the one child that we can make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| But if it has to apply in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| don't put your kid in a car tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| You shouldn't have shown up tonight in a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| if you're worried about one thing happening to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| I feel really sorry for the people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| we've been brainwashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| We've been brainwashed our whole lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| by the mainstream media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| There is a narrative that people are following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| and they are trying to make us afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| There's fear-mongering going on left and right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and there are so many people who are succumbing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| If you're afraid of your child catching COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| if you're afraid of yourself catching COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| I know someone brought this up earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| by golly, put a mask on, put a mask on your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| Don't trample on my freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| on my ability to parent my own child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| And that is what I was referring to in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| that we've got to come together as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| and realize we are a country of freedoms and rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| The fact that I don't want to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| or that I don't want my child to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| has nothing to do with any of the other parents here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| or anybody else's ability to make their own choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| How dare you tell me it's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| for my right to be taken away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| but it's okay for you to trample,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| but it's not okay for me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| I want my freedoms, you don't get yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| I'm also in complete agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I think we're not supposed to call out anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| on the board by name, and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| but there's a particular member who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| he's made a very good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| that we cannot continue to follow what the CDC says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| because they have gone back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| with their opinions and their statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| They are a paid organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| If you look at who they get paid by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| it's very evident to see there's a narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| that they are trying to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| This Delta variant that they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| I've seen the list of the next variants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| that they're planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| They already know when they're going to affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| I believe Lambda is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| they're going to come out with in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| There are no tests that can say it's Delta variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| There are no tests that exist for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| So we cannot sit here and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| there are all these kids getting sick from COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| or I mean, from the Delta variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| I also wanted to make sure that I brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| the fact that we've discussed last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| especially that no child should be bullied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| whether or not they want to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I'm totally in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| And I know every parent in here believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| that their child does not deserve to be bullied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| whether or not they're wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Now I'm hearing from parents all across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| from my own son at his high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| that teachers are now trying to signal out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| students who have been vaxed and who have not been vaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| If you want a lawsuit on your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| then you better, or don't want a lawsuit on your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| you better make sure that these teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| are not singling out our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| whether or not they've been vaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Because we are way beyond that kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| gosh, I'm losing my words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| segregation that we do not need to put up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I do not want my child not getting the proper education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| because he's not been vaxed or given the jab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| Kim Sprague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5453)|
| 1:31:05| Please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| My name's Kim Sprague and my county of residence is Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| I wanted to thank all of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| for sitting here and listening to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| and allowing us to share our thoughts with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I do have an expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| I'm a mental health therapist of over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| I'm a licensed clinical social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| but I come to you tonight as a parent of three teenagers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| One last one that's still in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I've shared with you before about the mental health impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| that COVID restrictions have had on our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| I'm sure you remember, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| I won't repeat it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I want to add with school back in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| the threat of reinstating restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| is very upsetting to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| It's causing an increased sense of uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| apathy and anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Really more than I anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Kids feel like the other shoe is gonna drop again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| and that they should just give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| So I ask you to please stay firm in your commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| to keep schools open in a normal fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| I appreciate the leadership you've shown thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| and I ask you to please maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| Additionally, I'm concerned about multiple accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| just this week, I mean, we've only had a few days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| of teachers asking students during class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| to raise their hand if they were vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| Multiple accounts of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| They are asking minor students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| to share protected health information in a public arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| which violates their privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Calling them out in front of others is social shaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| And I don't like to misuse the word bullying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| but we have a clear power differential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| between a teacher and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| And it really could be in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| It's definitely harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| It's creating a hostile environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| The Knox County School website states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| that one of its top priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| is to create a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| That is not done by singling kids out in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| You on the board have a mission to support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| And I'm asking you to swiftly nip this behavior in the bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| I'm asking you to please enforce a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| that allows students to learn in an environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| that does not harass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I don't want anybody bullied for wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| or not wearing a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| for getting vaccinated or not getting vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| Those questions have no place in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| We have many amazing teachers and principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I know my students have been very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| And when they have concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| they have the teachers unions to advocate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| Your priority as a board is to support our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| So please help keep the school culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| free of this intimidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| and nip these illegal practices of harassing our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| over their protected health information in the bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| Amelia Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5685)|
| 1:34:57| Hi, I'm Amelia Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| I live in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| and I'm the mother of three small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| One who is starting first grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| at Beaumont Magnet Academy this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| I wrote a letter to the parents and school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| who are against a mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| and tonight I'll be addressing the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| I shared this with parents at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Individual rights are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| No one wants to be told what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| how to live or what's best for their own child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| We all want our children to be safe and healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| and not just healthy, but thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| And seriously, masks are scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| They make us feel uneasy and weak and vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| They remind us of death and make us feel trapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| I hate having to wear a mask too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I hate having to buy tiny masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| for my children's tiny faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I get all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| but here's what I need help understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| How do I explain to my first grade daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| that she needs to wear a mask in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| so that she doesn't expose others to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| but other kids don't have to wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| because their parents want them to have a normal experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| and personal choice is more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| than the health of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| What about when she asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| why she has to wear shoes to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Does she get a personal choice in that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| No, that would be ridiculous, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| You might step on glass or get sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| or spread yucky germs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Our health is important and shoes keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Boom, mom of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Okay, what about when she asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| why she can't wear spaghetti-strapped tank tops to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| Should I say that it's because girls' bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| are too much of a distraction in an educational environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| Or how about your shoulders could keep boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| from reaching their academic potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Or should I tell her that she has to wear certain clothes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| because she's responsible for the thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| and actions of boys and men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| But don't worry, you don't have to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| because you're not responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| if you give your friends a virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| that could kill people in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Am I communicating to my child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| that her tiny shoulders are a greater threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| to her school community than a deadly pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| Am I teaching my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| that her body needs to be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| when it threatens the academic achievement of boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| but not when the physical health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| of her entire community is in jeopardy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| And is the school I'm sending her to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| endorsing or enforcing these thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| If a mask is a violation of personal rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| then so is a dress code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| And I don't see a lot of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| protesting Knox County Schools' dress code policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| We frequently accept the loss of personal freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| in order to be part of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| The clothes we wear, the language we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| the way we drive, the food we eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| We even adapt to sacrifice greater freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| when living in dangerous circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| Think of all the freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| that our armed forces sacrifice when deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| so they can operate efficiently and do their jobs well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Think of the personal freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| our medical community has had to sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| this year to keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| To be a part of any organized, healthy community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| requires some abandonment of personal freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| So why are we digging our heels in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| on whether or not to wear masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Do kids really find masks to be so horrifically oppressive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| Or are we projecting our own experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| of a traumatic year on our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| I don't believe I'm asking too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| of my children to wear masks just for a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| until we can protect them in other ways from this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| I want my daughter to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| that while she is not responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| for the thoughts and choices of other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| her choices do affect other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| When this is all over, I want her to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| that I did everything I could to keep her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| and our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| But most importantly, not only her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| I also wanted to say, I know we've talked a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| no one should decide for my child what's safe for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I 100% believe that every parent in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| believes that, cares for their child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| cares for other children in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| I think one of our biggest challenges as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| especially in this really difficult year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| is that we've been so separated from each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| and our only source of connection is through the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| and through Facebook and through Instagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| And we're reaching out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5940)|
| 1:39:00| we're trying to connect in those ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| but those ways are separating us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| and that we are able to create these separate realities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| in which one person fully believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| that they've done the research and that masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| And another person fully believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| and they've done their research that masks do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| And there's an information gap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| And so we need your leadership and your guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| to provide us with experts who understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| and can communicate in ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| that we can all hear and receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| We need our leaders to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And I know that this is a new virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| This is a new experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| We've never been through a pandemic together as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| and it's happening all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And if we don't find some way to communicate effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| and provide information that is reliable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| that we can trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| then we're never gonna understand each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| And we need that desperately right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Margaret, I'm probably not gonna say this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| Nick, Nickell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| Is it Margaret Nicara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| And I probably said your name wrong, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| It's Margaret Nicquara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| You were very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| I'm here to represent, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| just some of the special needs kids like my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| And the only reason I brought her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| is I couldn't find childcare tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| So the mask mandate isn't about the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| This isn't about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| And it isn't about the issue of personal liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| that some people mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| because this isn't a personal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| This is a community issue at which schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| are in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| That is what will keep our children healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| and safe during this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| And overwhelming evidence from the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| and other health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| tell us that wearing masks is an effective way of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| We did it last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| and it helped to keep schools relatively COVID free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| In the light of the explosion of new cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| I urge you to do what as a board you decided to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| which was to follow CDC guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| and mandate masks in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| This is particularly important for kids like my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| who cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| Uphold your duty of care to these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| and make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Many people have chosen not to be vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| and it is used to further spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| excuse me, the virus to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Because of this, we need to use this mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| as our last line of defense for these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| that have to enter an indoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| crowded, largely unvaccinated building every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| This is not about what Glenn Jacob wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| or what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6107)|
| 1:41:47| None of us want any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| This is about doing what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| and what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| and what this board can vote on to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| is to keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| And as someone else mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| we should do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| even if it's only a possibility that it may help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| Why don't we do everything we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| Not all kids are healthy and will be able to bounce back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Lisa Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6135)|
| 1:42:38| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| You'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| My name is Lisa Taylor, Knox County 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| I really did not come prepared to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| If I didn't hear some other things already mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I was gonna lay low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| but I have heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| I just wanna reiterate just a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Last spring, when the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| regarding the reopening plan was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| many of us parents and community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| just asked for consistent information across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| As parents, we have simple expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| that all things would be said and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| at all KCS elementary schools are the same things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| I should say, would be done at all KCS elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| all KCS middle schools, all KCS high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| We've only been in school for two and a half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| And as some other parents have already alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| I have heard the same things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| that there have been middle school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| who have asked the students in the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| to raise their hand if they've been vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| I have heard administrators at assemblies this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| who have praised and thanked the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| who are wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| who at least in my child's school was a small minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| And again, that's their choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| and I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| But at the same time, the students who were unmasked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| felt that they were doing something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| or almost belittled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| or if you wanna use the word bullied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| that's how they felt, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| I just think, I don't know what was communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| behind the scenes to staff and administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| teachers, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| but it still seems like there's inconsistencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| across the board from the elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| all the way to the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Really, that's all I'm asking as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| If we can make that happen and clear statements are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| to these folks that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| you can't ask the kids in the school, in your class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| if they've been vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| That's just, it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| If we could just kind of come to that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| that's all I would ask of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| and those who are in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| of making those kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I just don't think that we're making things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| even more divisive for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| when they're sitting next to their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| and this student is wearing a mask and this student isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| and this student's being praised for wearing a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| and this student has an administrator saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I hope you've been vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| if you're not wearing your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I mean, can we just make a simple statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| and let them know what the policy is and that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| So if we can just reiterate that, that's all I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| And lastly, I just wanna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| I'm a healthcare professional as well for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| I worked in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| I understand that everybody has an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| about all of the things, the masks, the vaccines, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| but we have to understand that this country is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| and probably the world really, is 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| You can take this group of healthcare professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| who all went to the same schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| who had the same training and education who say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| and these people over here who say differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| So when we say, listen to the science, listen to science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| you can hear whatever kind of science you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| depending on who you're listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| So I think it's just important for us to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| No one, I think we've already realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| that no one is ever gonna agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| None of us will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| COVID is not going away ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I think for those of us who may have once thought that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| you know, we wanna get back to normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| we can't get back to normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| we can't wait to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I don't think as a person that lives in this society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| that we're ever gonna get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| We have to understand what we're gonna do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| And our children, masking and vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| those shouldn't be the things that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| We should be concerned about their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| and the test scores and all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| and setting them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| And, you know, we wanna create these great programs for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| for, you know, the trades and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| Let's focus on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| We've got money and we've got resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Let's just focus on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Let parents make the choices for their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| and we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Thank you, Steve Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6422)|
| 1:47:11| Am I saying it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Steve, I think Steve Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Oh, okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6442)|
| 1:47:22| Dr. Steve Burleson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| We are all exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| We're exhausted by talking about this and dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| As the young lady before me just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| just do a quick little history and virology here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| This is the COVID virus, respiratory virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| It's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Just like the flu or the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| This is something that we'll be dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| with 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| This will still be a seasonal, maybe bi-seasonal issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| that we will continue to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Now, I get people on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I get people with masks on, they're afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| With less education, less knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| of what's really going on, I'd be afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| And then people on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| I get why they're afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| And they want their freedoms back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| So I get both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| But what I'd like to do is I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| and if this works, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| If not, I'm just gonna kind of go over a few topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| One of the things I wanted to say is really cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| is that going to drop my kids off at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| we're at AOL Lotz, great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| We love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Parents over the last 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| have been educating themselves on everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| that they can do to possibly do the right things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| to make sure their kids and their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| are safe and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| So when we drop our kids off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| that we're seeing probably maybe 5% of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| and students wearing masks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| So that tells us that the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| of the people do not want to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Now we have a pretty big mask population here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| And kudos to everybody who showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| to have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| But when we look at the grand scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| the majority of the people are done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| And there's gonna be a huge population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| of the student bodies that's probably gonna pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| their kids out of school if we keep going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| towards these mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| A colleague of mine recently did a school board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| similar to this, and I was kind of gonna reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| some of the stuff that he had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| But I'm gonna try to see if I can play his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| I think I can get this in, his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| He did a really good job of just kind of illustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| kind of what we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| Hold on just a minute, I'm not sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Please stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| To address your comment about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6579)|
| 1:49:39| gee, it's hard to believe we're 18 months into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| and still having a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| And I would suggest the reason we still have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| is because we're doing things that are useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| and we're getting our sources of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Please turn that off for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| Yeah, if you would like to speak about your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| that is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Okay, that's fine, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| All right, so we talked about the CDC and the NIA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| and the research that they're saying about wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| not wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| The CDC and the NIA have got multiple studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| illustrating that masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Now, if anybody wants this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| please don't interrupt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Excuse me, let's respect everybody that's speaking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| If you want this information, please come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| and I will be gladly be able to provide that to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| This is an absolute fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| We've gone back and forth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| And we are looking at a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| where we are looking to control the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| off of something that basically fear factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| what we've been under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| We talk about vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Vaccinations will, what their goal is for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| and this isn't really truly a vaccination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| it's a therapeutic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| And what its job is to do is to decrease symptomatology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| if you do catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| It does not decrease the passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| or contraction of the COVID virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| So we had a member last week mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| if everybody gets their vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Let's say everyone does get the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| That does not decrease the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| of the transmissibility of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| It will still pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Just as the NHL, I think, had a mumps outbreak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| a few years ago in a mumps vaccination population of the NHL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| Well, the reason why it passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| is that the virus will still be contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| into the individual and it can still be passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| So vaccination, we gotta understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| that it's not going to decrease the transmissibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| We talk about the PCR test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| PCR test has a huge false positive rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| up to anywhere 60 to 75% false positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| This is why at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| they're canceling the use of the PCR test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| because it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| And we've been utilizing these tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| to keep track of COVID cases, which is just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| And we talk about number of children right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| in hospitals right now that have been diagnosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| or have been tested to have positive COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| These aren't children that went into the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6723)|
| 1:52:03| There are children that went into the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| had a PCR test and the PCR test said they had COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| because they need these types of tests to be admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Now, if you have a test that has over 50% false positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| and these children are going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| they're not going in because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| but they are being tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| And this is why their numbers are where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Now, we can all be, again, being smart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| washing our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6745)|
| 1:52:25| do the things that we need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| to get to keep ourselves safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| but by masking ourselves is not going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| And they can continue to deal with this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| If you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| moving forward, it's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6762)|
| 1:52:58| He'll just state your name and County of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I was hoping I didn't have to spend my time to be here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| but unfortunately, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Here I am after everyone came to an agreement last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| that much too much of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| and the public's time was spent discussing the same exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| matter, you've had facts after facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| after facts presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| But yeah, I feel like we're wasting taxpayer time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| I mean, I understand that as a board, you would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| to address concerns of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| I don't know what the percentage is for every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| but my child said it's about half and half for the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| and the employees of Knox County Schools wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| I have no problem with people wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| if they do it hygienically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| but the problem is you can't force people to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| that they're not ready and willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| This is why following our conscience and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| that God-given freedom is such an important thing in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| To think that we should oppress half of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| to appease the fears of the other half, that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6863)|
| 1:54:30| Where's the logic in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| I mean, if you think there's logic in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| I question the board, I question Knox County Schools as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| as educating students because it's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| You have the science, you do the math, do the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| I know there's a lot of deception out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| but if you're a critical thinker, it's not that hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| to get to the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Most times the truth is hidden in plain sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| but we're often distracted or too busy working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| or with our family or whatever it is that consumes all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| of our valuable time in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| But we don't get time back, every second that every one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| of us is breathing on this earth is precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Everyone matters, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| It's really sad to see our nation so divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| I mean, even on the local level, seeing how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| the county's divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| You know, we could play the blame game all day and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| that we all have a role to play in this, parents, educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| public policy makers, I could go on and on, probably churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| I mean, I can't leave them out, families of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| people who, you know, try to do good and live right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| and have good morals and live out their faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| through serving others and loving others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| You know, isn't that what life's all about, is love?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Love one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| I mean, that's the golden rule, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Treat others how you want to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| I mean, if I have a fear and it's irrational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| now some fears are rational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| but if I'm telling you that you should be harmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| because I'll feel better, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| That is very wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| I mean, is it that difficult to convince people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| that good is evil and evil is good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I mean, look at the Milgram experiments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| from I think the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| The conclusion was that people will obey authority even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| if they feel that they're doing wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| and it's causing harm to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| We're taught that it's good to obey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| I want my child to obey her teacher and her educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| That's the respectful and the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| but I don't want her to obey them if they are in the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| I want her to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| But these children are so easily molded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| Their minds are still being molded and conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| and we shouldn't condition them in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| Viruses are a part of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| I mean, coronavirus killed President William Henry Harrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| in 1841, the first president to die in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| We didn't shut down the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| and take people's freedoms away and oppress them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| because we feared that we might get sick and die like he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| That's irrational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| That wasn't my heart and I hope you can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| where I'm coming from and I hope the future gets better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| for society and especially for education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| because that's the future of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7084)|
| 1:58:04| Brooke Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7084)|
| 1:58:15| Brooke Davis, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| I'm on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| Okay. I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| I've never done anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| Thank you for allowing me this time and platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| to voice my thoughts and opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| I'm very passionate about what I think and feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| I have a fourth grader and a kindergartner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| in school this year at Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| First off, I would like to share a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| that masks have been proven to work for protection in COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| Wait. There is no study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| I can't actually share it because it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7131)|
