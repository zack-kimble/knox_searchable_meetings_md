| 0:00:30| Welcome, everyone, to the April 2024 Planning Commission Agenda Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| At this time, I'll turn it over to our Executive Director, Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| Okay, let me get situated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| I have a few updates for you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| I also wanted to let you all know, I believe Dallas has sent this out in the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| that we will be in this room for Agenda Review going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| So hopefully that's comfortable for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| Okay, so I'm going to start off with a couple internal updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| I'm really excited to announce that we have filled two vacant positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| As you all can see from our agendas, our workload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| and this is just a portion of the work that we do here at Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| but our workload remains very high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| and these two individuals will help us continue to be responsive to our customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| and to the community while also continuing to serve as a resource for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| Kelsey, I'm probably not going to pronounce her last name correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| Kelsey Busquette will join us as a planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| She will be assisting with development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| rezonings, and plan amendments and telecommunications review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| She begins her position here on April 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| And then we have Presley Desso has joined our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| She's actually here, sitting back there with Allie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| She is our new communications specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| and she will be working on newsletters, social media content, press releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| and creating educational materials and presentations for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| So we're really excited to have her join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| And I want to share a few updates about projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| So the CAT Opportunities Mapping Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| this has been on our work program since last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| but council finally approved a contract between Planning and CAT and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| This is for a Federal Transit Administration-funded project on transit-oriented development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| and CAT received funding to develop this transit map a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| and the purpose of this map is to identify where transit-oriented development could blend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| with mixed and low-income development to provide housing and spur job opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| The map will provide the basis for the city to invest in high-quality transit services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| and may result in recommendations related to some land use changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| Planning developed a proposal last summer on behalf of CAT and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| and we see this as a great opportunity to leverage a number of different efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| that are currently underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| and we will serve as a convener for different departments working in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Some of those efforts include our ongoing work with the Priority Populations Data Analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| that we've maintained for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| our work assisting the city with their housing strategy and dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| and the General Commercial Zoning District Review that's been on our work program for several years as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| Incentives and Development Review, and then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| our Long-Range Mobility Plan through the Transportation Planning Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| This project officially kicks off next month, so we'll provide you all with regular updates on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| So we are also in the process of hiring a consultant team to assist us with outreach for the BREATHE project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Allie Ketron and our staff provided you all with an overview of that several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| but just as a reminder, BREATHE is a project that's funded through the EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| The CPRG is a two-stage grant program that provides funding to develop and implement plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollutants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| The City of Knoxville is serving as the lead organization on behalf of the Knoxville region, the MSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| and was awarded this planning grant fairly recently in August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| And then the city partnered with us to conduct regional outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| and we hope to kick off this outreach effort in early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| Hopefully you all heard that the City of Knoxville and KCDC received a very large grant recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| $42.6 million from the U.S. Department of DOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| This is really exciting. It's going to fund a lot of infrastructure projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| So as a supporter and key partner, we are really looking forward to supporting them in this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| and at some point we will get someone from the project team to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| and share a little bit more about what the plans are for those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| TDOT announced last Friday, some of you might have read the newspaper reports on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| their intent to study a 17-mile section of the I-40 and I-75 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| Their intention is to develop a corridor-wide strategy to better address congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| in this highly-traveled corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| The details of that have not been worked out, but exciting that they're taking a high-level view of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| It's been a priority of the TPO for a while to address some of the challenges along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| The growth policy plan is back to a vote at Farragut this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| We are hopeful that it is going to move forward this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| And the land use and transportation plan that you all recommended for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| will go to County Commission on April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| So we'll keep you all updated on the progress of those two important plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:11| And with that, we're ready to dive into the agenda, unless someone has any questions or comments to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Okay, so the first item on our agenda is number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| This is a request of the City's Plans Review and Inspection Department to amend Article 2.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| definitions to revise the definitions of independent living facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| I believe Ms. McGranz is here to speak on behalf of the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Yes, good morning. Christina McGranz-Tillery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| I'm an Assistant City Attorney with the Law Department for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Thank you for letting me speak today on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| As you can see on your screen in the bold print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| we are adding a couple of sentences here saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| an independent living facility includes a dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| that is newly constructed with more than four bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| or a dwelling unit renovated to increase the bedroom count to more than four bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| is presumed to be an independent living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| However, evidence may be supplied to the Zoning Administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| that no portion of the structure is intended for use as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| or actually used as, more than one rental unit regardless of the number of leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| So that is our proposal. It's adding to the definition only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| We are proposing this because we continue to see a number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| coming before our Plans Review and Building Inspections folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| for single family, two family, and townhouse dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| with large numbers of bedrooms to be rented out by the bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| This model obviously increases the density beyond the intent of some of our current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and functions very differently than, say, a single family household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| We're seeing this type of proposed development at a much increased rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| and this type does not currently fit into a clear category of one of our other definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| So it has created a little bit of a legal issue for us, which I'll go into later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| But we are proposing this as a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| This way it will be clear where these types of proposed developments fall into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| and are addressed in the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| and it also creates consistency with the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| because the number five is actually something that aligns with the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| for the bedrooms and the fire requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| I also want to mention that this proposal was thoroughly reviewed at the law department level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| and in conjunction with Plans Review and Building Inspections as well as policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| We are confident that it meets the requirements and protections of the Fair Housing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| as well as the State Human Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| We want to be sure in this that we're supporting development of housing appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and that our zoning code is clear for property owners and developers in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| So that's why this proposal only adds to the existing definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| And I want to point out as well for the community that this is only going to apply to new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| and projects where they are being renovated to add additional bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| So anything that is lawfully existing, this would not be applicable to those types of setups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| So how did we arrive at the four-bedroom count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Well, we looked first at the census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Census data shows that over 98% of Knoxville households are four bedrooms or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| And we do have some homes that are larger, but they don't make up a large percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| obviously less than 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| There are some building construction standards, again, that change with that increase of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| so this creates some consistency for our development community and for our staff in the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| And it's also key to note that our proposal recognizes that there are going to be some times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| where a family may just need a large house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| If they have extended family that live with them or a large amount of children that live with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| they may just need additional bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And that's why you see the clause in the proposal starting with, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| the evidence may be supplied to the zoning administrator that no portion is intended for use as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| or actually used as a rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| So that would take them out of the definition of independent living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| and put them into one of the categories of dwelling and whatever that might cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| two-family, single-family, multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| It would not be under the independent living facility definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| Our proposal aligns with the density provided by rent by the room structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| with the appropriate zoning category in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And, for example, as you know, our code requires specific dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| such as minimum lot specifications, building height, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| based on the specific zoning of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| So from a density perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| a 30-bedroom duplex that is intended to function as a rent-by-the-room model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| is not the same as a single-family neighborhood zone like Rn1 is intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| However, it could be appropriate in Rn3 or Rn4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| which, of course, are higher-density areas, depending on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| So, therefore, that's why we are proposing this to fall under independent living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| That will give the planning commission the ability to review projects like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| as a special use that will come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| And this aligns more with the type of projects with the intended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| And, overall, we believe that this proposal supports our existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| while clarifying projects with larger room counts intended to rent by the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| ensuring that they fit in with our zoning code and hit that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| And this proposal also supports our development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| by providing clear paths forward for a variety of types of projects along these lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| So we are here and available for questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| We have folks from Plans Review and Building Inspections and Policy today to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:48| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| What kind of evidence would you need for someone to supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| if they were building something that had more than four bedrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I think we would handle that on probably a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| But I think that it's possible we could come up with a form for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| or if we have the plans and show that there is a residency status that's being met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| and there's a verification of a large family there that's not going to be rented by the bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| all of that we would take into consideration in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| This is not intended to make it harder for families that are of a large size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| to build to accommodate their family sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| That's not the intent of this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| It just seems like things can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Someone can build something, someone else takes it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| and then they can start renting it out by the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| It looks like there's workarounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| How would you define a bedroom versus a study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Or someone says, well, that's a dining room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| And is this in result of the ordinance that was put before us last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| regarding the parking situation in some of these large developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| The proposal before you today is intended to fix a little bit of a legal gray area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| where we have these projects that come in that do not fall into a good definitional category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and that's why we're adding this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| And that's why we're adding this clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| so that it is clear what category they fit into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| Did you all think about writing a new definition for these type of homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Is there a group homes definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Yes, there are other definitions like group homes, residential care facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| there's a daycare home, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Group homes, would it be more appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| No, not in this context because we're not talking about individuals with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| that are needing some kind of care and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| And what will happen with the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| How will this address some of the parking concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| The independent living facility in Article 11 has its own standards for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| I can let one of our Plans Review and Building Inspections folks comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| but the standards for the independent living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| is that there's a minimum of .65 parking spaces per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| and guest parking of 0.2 per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| I have a question about this for you, but also just to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| this leads to the same parking standards that were presented last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| with the single family and duplexes of multi-bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| the same calculation of .65 per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| This is the same amount of parking required with this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| So, to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| And one question that I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I know that independent living is a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| or a special use approval in RN-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| but also the dimensional standards for independent living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| follows in the definitions it refers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| It's the same as multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| but RN-3 does not have dimensional standards for independent living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| or sorry, for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| So, how do you determine lot size and density in RN-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| when there's not a multifamily allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So, as part of the special use review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I'll have to defer to planning on what they would recommend in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| But with the RN-4 guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| I think that we would look to those to determine appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| But you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And this is not a change to the code that is supposed to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| the issue of dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Again, this is to address a legal concern that has come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| in the context of how to categorize these particular developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| And then, I've also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Obviously, this is for specifically indirectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| but student housing in the fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| And when you look at the dimensional standards for RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| RN-5, and RN-6, multifamily...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| And of course, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| RN-3 doesn't have dimensional standards for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Multifamily has a minimum lot size of 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| And as we know, most of the historic grid neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| have lot widths around 50 feet, 50, 55, sometimes 60 or 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| So, what this does is, in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| and maybe not, but from everything I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| this would essentially create an exclusionary way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| of only allowing small single-family or duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| in most lots in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| So, in the area where we're trying to increase housing for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| my understanding is that if you have a 50 by 150 foot wide lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| and you want to do student housing in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| you would, in every scenario, assume...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| If you're in an RN zone, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| there's commercial zones there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| but you would be restricted to only being able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| a four-bedroom single-family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| or maybe a four- and four-bedroom duplex, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| You couldn't even do like a five- or six-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Well, if you have the five- or six-bedroom, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| that it would fall into the independent living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| if the units are going to be rented out per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| I will say the variance process is still available in cases like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| I can't ever comment on what the BZA will grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| versus what they won't, but, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| hardships are always related to the land and its own characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| So, lot size, lot shape, topography, issues of those nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| are always relevant in those discussions as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| to provide adjustments from the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| In most BZA meetings that I've been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| when there's been a question of lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| related to number of units or amount of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| from what I've seen, that's not being considered a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| because, yeah, you could always do a single-family or a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| So I don't see that as being a viable option for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| I guess everyone has a different opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| on how we should address the needs for student housing in the Fort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| but I just think that this is very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| for multifamily-type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| but I definitely have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| about the implications of this in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| And to clarify as well, a lot of the projects that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| we're not talking about a five- or six-bedroom structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| We're talking about a duplex with, say, 30 or 40 bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| And so those are things that we are keeping in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| with this particular definition change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| So if there is a more appropriate number, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| we can evaluate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I have a follow-up question from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| If you have a duplex with a lot of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I've never seen one with that many, but let's say you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| that is, building code has that, from a life-safety standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| has that under control by pushing that into the IBC instead of IRC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| So it doesn't, from a building code life-safety standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| it doesn't matter if you call it a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| because they're going to look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| no, this is congregate living and you're going to IBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| What is the benefit of, from a zoning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| what is the difference there of whether it's called a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| or it's called independent living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| So if you look at the use matrix in Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| duplexes are allowed potentially in RN1 and RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| which are single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Now, they are allowed there as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| but it is conceivable that a duplex with 30 bedrooms could go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| an RN1 or an RN2 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| That is out of alignment with the intent of those zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| which is, again, low density and single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| So this is more to align with what the intent of the zones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| So should the bedroom count be increased maybe to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| if it's a 10 or 15-bedroom-per-unit type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Because 20 or 30, yeah, that definitely makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| for the RN1s or 2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| But did staff look at maybe a higher threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| than four bedrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| We looked at available data, and the one that we cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| was for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Number one, going with the census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| showing that over 98% of the bedrooms or houses in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| have four bedrooms or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| So this proposal would affect less than 2% of the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| in the buildings, the structures that are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| And not only that, but this aligns and provides some consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| with the building code where those five bedrooms kick it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| to different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So that is the basis for why we chose that particular number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| but that is within commission's purview to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| I'll let someone else take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| So if you do five bedrooms and it gets categorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| as an independent living facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| does each bedroom then count as a unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| in terms of the parking calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| So if you were to do a 40-bedroom duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| you would have to provide the .65 and .2 for the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| That comes out to 34 spaces, but then you would have potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| if you're within the transit area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| you would have that reduction that could bring you down to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| So that was an example I kind of walked through with staff earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| just to provide kind of some concrete baseline numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| It seems to me like this is just a loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| for what we saw last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Based on Logan's comments about lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| and all the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| we're bringing back the parking requirement that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| I mean, I roasted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I mean, that's just, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| that's dumb given that we just passed missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| with no parking requirements and we've been over the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| you know, the Fort is a walkable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| We want it to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Yes, my question here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| what is the issue that the city is actually trying to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Because I think we can all agree that there are better ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| to define this without effectively limiting the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| of affordable housing, which, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| is a huge problem in Knoxville, particularly with the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| particularly with young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And so it just kind of blows my mind that the city keeps trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| to, like, push through this policy that limits housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| I mean, that just can't be the city government's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| stated position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| So, again, this is something that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| to fix a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Because, again, with these types of developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| they do not fit neatly into any particular definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| So that's why I'm saying you can make a new definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| And I understand there being a legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| but now you're trying to create a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| And I really feel like if it was a legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| the law department would have defined the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| that you need to bring forth to get around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| But instead it's just a, oh, we don't know thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And I find that a little unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| It's not a we don't know thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| It's left flexible so that we can anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| a lot of different situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| There are, you know, uncharacteristic of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Someone else may have extended family that lives with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| They may have a large number of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| You know, the family make-ups, we don't want to start defining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| That's what we used to have in our old zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| was a functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| You're going to have to make them define it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| by coming before the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| or whoever or special use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| for somebody that wants to build a six-bedroom house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| is now going to have to come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| and explain how many kids they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Or the landlord's going to have to come say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| hey, I'm just trying to rent by the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| and we don't have any evidentiary standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| for what they're supposed to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Well, again, we're leaving that flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| so that we can anticipate other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| We can't possibly define every single piece of proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| that would be relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I mean, I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| but you can have evidentiary standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I mean, the federal rules of evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| the Tennessee rules of evidence, they're there, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| So I just find it a little unbelievable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| that all of a sudden we want to be super flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| when, in my opinion, this is just a loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| to get us back to where we started from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| in the beginning of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| And I think that it's, frankly, as the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| not you personally, but I think the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| needs to take a good look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| at the actual problems facing this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| and quit trying to push through stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| that's going to limit housing for people that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| We're without lights here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| so that's why I keep raising my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| One of the things that Katie said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| was about the creation of a different categorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| And I apologize if this has already been gone over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| but why was that route not taken in this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| This definition is what we have historically started with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| for large developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| which is why we chose to include it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It also is a little bit less of a heavy lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| in terms of having to update also the use matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| potentially use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| So it also is a much smaller tweak to the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| to include it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| And again, historically, this is what we have used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| as a starting point for these types of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:15| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Well, I think that's a good teaser for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| This is going to be an exciting topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| among a very lengthy agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| not only today, but for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| So I appreciate all of the input and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| Let's try to save some for Thursday, too, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| All right, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Executive Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Yes, we're going to move on to agenda item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| This is another ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| that has a little bit of history to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And you all have heard this previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| These were originally recommended for approval by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| and forwarded on to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| They also included drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| The amendments that Michelle is going to go over with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| in just a minute here do not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| the drive-thru facilities at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| We are continuing to work through those proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| at the request of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and we've separated out these because they are unrelated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| to the drive-thru portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Michelle will cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| So as Amy just said, these are going to be land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| that are added to the CA and CB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And just as a refresher, this stemmed largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| from the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| though that's been a while ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| But even though this is a recommendation of that study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| because we're proposing to add uses to these zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| it would apply countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| And so this has been looked at a little bit more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| in light of that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| This would be a short-term solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| until such time as a UDO would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| And again, just as a reminder, some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| that came up while we were talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| when this came before you before was the distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| of the CA and the CB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| So there's a lot of little, as you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| the little red speckles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| So there's a lot of CA zones that are not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| along major corridors, kind of in the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| that, if you look at the uses allowed within the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| it seems like they wouldn't be very impactful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| when you just add them to that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| But when you look at where the CA zone and CAB zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| are applied countywide, you kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| see you need to look at it with a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| of a fine grain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| The distribution of the CB is not quite as problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Those do occur more along the county lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| But you can see along in here, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| just a little bit of scattering around these rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And so when you look at the range of intensity of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| you guys are all familiar with this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| but ranging from single family on the low end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| to industrial on the high end, and it kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| steps up a little bit as you go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| What we found when we looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| was that in the CA zone in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| you had single family houses that were allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| and then commercial developments that were allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| but anything that's outlined in red was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| So you basically could have a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| house and a commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| or you could have a townhouse, a triplex, fourplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| a multifamily structure, which to us really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| didn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| And the CB zone doesn't allow any residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| so it's proposing to add some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| And again, these are where commercial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| and single family houses already coexist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| So adding more residential types of vetland into the mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| allows for more transitions along these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| And so digging into what we are proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| so by right, on behalf of Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| we've added in clinics, medical offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| dental offices, and other medical uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| of a similar nature, and that's to be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| by right within CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Also houses, duplexes, upper level dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| and multifamily structures or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| with density up to 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| also by right in both CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And looking at that a little bit more closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| the first provision under that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| for mixed use developments and upper level dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Density would be calculated based on the total acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| set aside for any uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| uses permitted or permitted on review in CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| And so what that means is it's basically looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| at the entire parcel, and if you have, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| a McDonald's in part of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| and you're wanting to build something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| in the other part of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| it uses that density over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| So to avoid double dipping for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| or sorry, for apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| and other types of residential developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| we specify that that would be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| for mixed use developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| and upper level dwelling units only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| to kind of allow more of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| that people were stating they were interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| as some of the feedback that we heard from Advance Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Also a type A landscape screen would be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| along property lines adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| to single family residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| and that's kind of already a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| within commercial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| and industrial developments when they're close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| or when they're abutting a single family residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| So this kind of takes that multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| and puts that in that same category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| to offer some protections and some buffers against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| In the CA zone, we are proposing for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| actually in CA and CB, we're proposing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| houses, duplexes, upper level dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| and multifamily structures or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| with density of up to 12 to 24 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| and that's uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| And then that's got that same provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| for mixed use developments and upper level dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| to have that same density calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| and that's also calling for that landscape screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| So the standards in the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| well, CA and CB, the height is going to be 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| that's supposed to be 45 feet, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| 45 feet or four stories versus 45 feet or three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| So the actual footage of the height is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| It's just the number of stories that could be allotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| within that height that we're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| or that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| In the lot area, the houses and duplexes in CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| that remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| We are proposing 2,000 square feet per dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| for attached dwellings, and for multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| we're proposing that to be based on road classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| and the growth policy plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| which I'll go through in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| And for setbacks, we are using the same as the RB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Those standards would apply to all of the housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| that we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Within CB, everything's basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| It's that 45 feet or four stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| versus the 45 feet or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| The difference is that we are adding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| houses and duplexes as used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| and we're proposing 75,000, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| 7,500 square feet for the first dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| and then 5,000 square feet for additional dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| And we're keeping that 2,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| per dwelling for attached, and then again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| multifamily would be based on these two criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| setbacks also as regulated in RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| And so looking at how we've looked at the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| for both CA and CB, we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| up to one dwelling unit per acre in rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| or up to two if the property meets the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| for two dwelling units acre as specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| for rural areas in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Up to five dwelling units an acre in planned growth areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| if the subject property is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| along a minor collector or a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| And if it's on an arterial or a major collector street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| in the planned growth area, we would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| up to 12 dwelling units per acre to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| And then in urban growth areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| which of course are closer to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| we would allow up to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| And so that is what the proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I'm happy to, oh, we have one more slide, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So if further subdivision is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| for residential uses, this kind of addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| what would happen in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| So that's just saying the maximum allowable density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| couldn't exceed the density that would have been permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| prior to the subdivision of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| And then the remaining density after the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| would be noted at the plot at the time of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So that's just kind of allowing, providing breadcrumbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| so that if somebody does do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| and they want to transfer density at a later time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| it allows us to kind of see what that density was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| to kind of help us track how that gets transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| If I could just pop in before we turn over to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I just want to note, obviously our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Michelle and Mike and others, have put in a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| into these ordinance amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| but I also wanted to be sure to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| that these have also been worked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| with our working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| as representatives from County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Mr. Mullins, representatives from Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| as well as representatives from County Codes and Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| I just wanted to share that with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| I guess I do have, excuse me, one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| The way I'm reading it, it almost is like a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| It allows more of a mixed use because in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| there is no real commercial type mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I mean, is that kind of the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Is it a stopgap before the UDO gets created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| It does allow for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| but it also allows for any of those other residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| So right now, you couldn't have multifamily in CA or CB at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| So it does allow for just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| your typical apartment complex building to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| but the upper level dwellings that we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| or that we're proposing does allow for more of a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| So a commercial on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| or an office on the bottom with residential above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| that you'd find in more of a mixed use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| And you can definitely tell by the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| that you guys spent a lot of time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| And from a practical matter, just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I have heard in being a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and have seen situations where you've got a piece of CA or CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| which are on major thoroughfares that would be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| yet the seller is not willing to allow someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| to build multifamily on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| because they're afraid they have to downzone the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| the multifamily, in order to build apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| But this would allow that to be instilled in a good area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| because I think you classified it well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| in protecting the rural areas with tying it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| is it a major collector or a rural road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| So good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| What's the reasoning for retaining single family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| as an allowed use within CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I guess I think about it both in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| and I've seen it in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| But if we envision these areas being as part of advanced NOCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| sort of corridors or higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| why would we allow single family residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| And I think that goes again to how it's scattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| If it was along the major routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| then I think it would make sense probably not to have that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| but because you do have sprinklings of that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| in the rural areas where a house would be perfectly fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| and probably preferable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| then it kind of allows that to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| without being out of compliance with a zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| And I think it also because in some areas too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| there's maybe broader swaths of CA and CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| where you might not want that higher intensity commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| to encroach as far into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| So it might make sense to have some of those residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| to be able to transition from a corridor back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| to where residential would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Now we're going to move on to item number 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| This is another minor amendment to the city zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| And I'll turn it over to Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| The planning is recommending an ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| to add a residential care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| as a special use in the OP office park zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| The intent of the OP zone is to accommodate large office developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and office parks slash campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| The campus environment is actually mentioned twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| in the purpose statement as the intended development form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| It also emphasizes an environment where there are employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| and potential services provided for said employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| The definition of a residential care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| is a licensed institution providing care of persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| in need of assistance, services, or supervision in their daily life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| And this can be of a medical or non-medical nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Examples include nursing homes, assisted living facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| hospice, and continuum of care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| The definition is potentially expanded to independent living facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| but only if it is considered part of that continuum of care model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| which is a concept that involves guiding and tracking patients over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| through varying intensities of health service and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| The intent of the OP zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| and a residential care facility are closely aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| in that they involve professional employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| and emphasize a campus-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| The OP district permits by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| several uses that are not directly associated with an office per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| but do involve employees and may benefit from a campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| These uses include a drug treatment clinic, an educational facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| specifically a university or college or a vocational school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| a hotel, and a place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Special uses that aren't defined by an office environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| but do have staff and potentially a campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| include a health care facility, an arts and fitness studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| and a halfway house, which is for people transitioning back to society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| from a penitentiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| A residential care facility is similar in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| and potentially less intensive than a halfway house or a health care facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| so we propose that a residential care facility join them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| for consideration as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:19| We will move on to agenda item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Give them just a second to change computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| This is Samuel's case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| This is a request for a 14-lot subdivision on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| west of Harvey Road on the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Did I skip one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| It's got to be on 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| You must have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Yes, we have a revised one, so the one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| That item is being postponed, so we thought we'd discuss it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:42:01| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Staff is recommending approval of this 14-lot subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| It is included in today's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| because we have received several public comments regarding this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| The property is located at the edge of the county's jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| adjacent to Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| The property is zoned PR at up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| It was part of a larger 24-acre rezoning in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| which included the Oak subdivision to the north across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| The Oak subdivision has 56 lots yielding a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| of 2.59 dwelling units per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| This proposal has an approximate density of three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| From the aerial view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| we can see that the property is adjacent to a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| in the Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| The planning commission has recently approved a rezoning for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| for PR up to three dwelling units on the northeast corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| of Harvey Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| There is a blue-lined stream going through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| The blue-lined stream shown in blue in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| essentially splits the development into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| There are 12 lots with frontage on the proposed internal public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| off of North Shore Drive, and two lots will have access from Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| The public comments mention a potential drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| This proposal has two detention ponds in two of the three common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:48| The applicant is requesting a reduction in peripheral boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| as shown on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| The property boundaries run along the center of the North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| and Harvey Road, as no right-of-way was ever dedicated for these public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Because of that, the 35-feet peripheral boundary is measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| from a distance of 20 feet from the street center line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| instead of what we typically see from the property boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Staff is recommending approval of the requested peripheral boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| due to the blue-lined stream and shape of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The public comments also mentioned a potential traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| The proposed number of units does not warrant any traffic scope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| North Shore Drive is a two-lane, minor arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| while Harvey Road is a minor connected street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:51| I guess I got it out earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Let's move on to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| We're going to switch computers again and turn this over to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Mike, this request is to rezone one lot of our previously approved subdivision under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Let me get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2717)|
| 0:45:30| This one's a little bit of an odd one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| The applicant is requesting a rezoning from planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| to planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| It's only for this one lot in the newly or still-developing Dorchester subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:54| What staff is recommending is denial because it will make the rest of the subdivision noncompliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| with the planned residential to four dwelling units per acre zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| I'm not going to go through all the history on this, but basically 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| there was a larger property rezoned to planned residential up to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| which you can see is the large property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| There was a concept plan approved for about 73 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| and then later on a larger subdivision proposed the same year, which was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| That concept was eventually expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| In the meantime, about 29 1⁄2 acres were sold to a person to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| which then left a little bit less than 20 acres for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| A new subdivision concept plan was approved for 66 lots in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| In 2019, 70 lots were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| And in 2021, nine additional lots were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| In that time, the acreage of the property started changing as they got more accurate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| on the boundaries of their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| In 2021, it was noted that the 79 lots that were proposed would go slightly over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| four dwelling unit per acre maximum, so there are 4.06 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| There was a condition that during the platting stage, they verified the acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| and if they go over the density limit, they got to bring the density or the number of lots down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| So when the subdivision was platted, it was noted that they were over the density limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:38| so what was going to be a lot just turned into a future development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| or it's not a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| So the idea from the applicant is to rezone that into its own planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| therefore being able to plat one more lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| If they do this, then the remainder of the subdivision just goes over the density limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| It would be 4.08 dwelling units per acre, so that's why staff is recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| Really, they should have rezoned the entire development before they subdivided and sold lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:21| This is not what PR is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| I'm asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Well, I mean, it's for subdivisions, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| but it's an issue with the number of units that they're permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| and what they are wanting to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:53| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| How did we get past the four per the acre again anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| I mean, there was a note on the plat, but there had to be a final plat, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| So there was, on the concept plan, because of the acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| a lot of times, this is my kind of assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| we had concept plans based on not 100% data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| and so not knowing during the concept plan if their acreage was 100% accurate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| Because of right-of-way dedication or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Yeah, or maybe they haven't surveyed it, or who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| There was a condition that said during the platting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| which is you've got to survey a piece of property at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| you know what the acreage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| If you go over that density threshold, then you've got to reduce the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| And they were so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| I mean, there were just 0.06 dwelling units over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| They were very close to that acreage to allow that 79th lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Didn't want to not allow that to happen if they actually did have the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| So now we're only talking about one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| And the mechanics of that, of what you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| would be to rezone the entire subdivision to, like, 4.1 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| I mean, that would have been the ideal situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| But you can't do it now because you've got all these homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Yeah, you'd have to get the homeowners to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| And what is that piece like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| It's encumbered under the planned residential zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| Or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I mean, it is zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| It's just part of the acreage of the entire property that gets, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| if they created another buildable lot that just goes over their density that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| That's the gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| So mechanically, too, if you don't mind me, Vice Chair, this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| So if that lot was not included at all, it goes over the density now, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| Let's say it was subdivided or platted off, completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| Does the rest of the subdivision stand on its own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| So basically what you're seeing here in the calculation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| you know, if they zoned it RA, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| that acreage then would come out of the planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| Therefore, you have a smaller area for the planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| same number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| You're still going to go over the density limit regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Even if this property was rezoned to planned residential at five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| which would be allowed under the LDR land use, and then you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| just we don't do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| We don't allow transfer of density from one PR district to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| But if you did that and decided, okay, well, let's make it part of the mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| you still don't get to that 79th unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| To clarify, the 78 lots that are platted are all compliant with the density right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| This little sliver should have been basically platted as common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| but the entire thing would have remained compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Well, I mean, it's still compliant at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I mean, it's not a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| It's extra area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| It's not stated as common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| That would be, you know, the ultimate preferred route if this does not become a buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| You know, it tends to get rezoned to allow the additional lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| but otherwise it just stays under private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Just as like a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Trying to squeeze a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Since the building out has already been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| is the lot that's right beside this slivering question, has that been sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:15| I believe it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| A lot of these lots have already changed ownership from the original developer or from the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| I can't remember if the one next door is actually built on yet or still under the builder's ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| but many of those in that area are already sold and built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| And I'm just imagining the scenario of the owner, that being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| someone's living there or getting ready to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| they bought it under the understanding that that was just a big empty space beside their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| and now all of a sudden it could change at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| I mean, that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| If you go out there, this looks like a house lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| If somebody went to the site, they probably would not know that this was not a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| So do we have conditional zoning in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| So you, even though it's not the intent of what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| and I'm not suggesting that we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| but if you did rezone it to six per the acre or whatever it is with a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| that only one house gets built on the lot as shown, would that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| I mean, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| I don't think you'd need to just because four dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| you're only going to get one lot or one unit anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| But the condition, so there's no precedent or somebody doesn't try to get around something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:44| but it would say that the intent would be to provide an exhibit that it's a one lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| one house, one unit, so you can't put a duplex on it or something crazy like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| Yeah, I mean, you could do a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I'm not sure it would be necessary because you really wouldn't be able to get two units on it regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| And this does not matter about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| You just said it's in the second plan, it's in the LDR, which is one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Is this inside this new growth boundary too as well or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| I'm fairly certain it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| This area was pretty well into the planned growth area before anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| We can move on to agenda item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Okay, so this is Whitney Warner's case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| She's not here today, so if I stumble through just a little bit, please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| Okay, so this is a rezoning request on Powell Drive in the Powell area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| so just northeast of Clinton Highway, which you see here, and Emery Road is to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| so this is Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| They're requesting CA general business zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| It's just barely over three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| It has frontage on Powell Drive, which is a major corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| so the only access that it has currently is through Larkspur Lane, which goes down the Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| As we noted, it does have frontage on Powell Drive, but it currently has no access to Powell Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| which is a TDOT facility, so it does require TDOT approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| The south side of Powell Drive is a mix of uses, including mobile home park to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| single-family subdivision and office, industrial and commercial uses to the south and southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:47| Powell Drive is a five-lane road with a turn lane and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| It was constructed in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| The street was constructed to relieve traffic on West Emery Road through downtown Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| near Brickyard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Clinton Highway to the west end of Powell Drive is an auto-oriented commercial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| and Emery Interstate I-75 interchange is to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| In 2012, the CA zoning was approved across the street for Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| That's here at the intersection of Powell Drive and Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| That CA zoning was recommended for approval because it was an extension of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| and is compatible with the scale and intensity of the development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| That property also has access to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| The CA zone is for general retail, business, and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| This location is not appropriate for general commercial or retail uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| with single-family residential adjacent to the south and the mobile home trailer park to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| Medium to low intensity zoning would be preferable at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| So the mixed-use special district as part of the sector plan does allow consideration of the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| It does talk about not recommending commercial industrial zoning next to residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| that are outside of the mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| The residential uses that are adjacent are within the mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| but I don't see those going away anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| So as we mentioned, the property does have furniture from Powell Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| which is a major arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| I'm talking to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| They would likely not allow a full access to Powell Drive because of site distance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| So if somebody did seek a commercial zoning and did seek an access to Powell Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| they'd be limited to right in, right out, and then have to install a barrier in the median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| so that people cannot physically turn left or turn left into the site either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:59:08| So as a recap, we're recommending denial of the zone because it is incompatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| with the surrounding development and would encroach into the existing residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3553)|
| 0:59:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Any questions? Doesn't look like it. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Let's move on to Mike's next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| It's agenda item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Taylor Forrester is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| This is a rezoning request from agricultural to planned residential up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| It's on Choteau Road near the south end of the Choteau Peninsula next to the Choteau Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| Staff is recommending approval of the planned residential zone up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| because it is consistent with the surrounding development and permitted residential intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| The F floodway zone will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| And I'm sorry, I messed up a couple of my slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| But anyway, I'll just explain it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| The red line is the F floodway zone boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| So it will remain to the east in basically the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| There is a gap between the F floodway zone and the TVA 820 line, elevation line, that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| if this was approved, it would get rezoned to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| We don't typically allow density below 820 to count towards density on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| because that is encumbered by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| It's a small area, but it's something that everybody seems to be mindful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:56| The site does have a substantial amount of hillside protection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| There is a fairly large flat area on the riverside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| They do have two access points, obviously Choteau Road, which does have some slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| And then there's also a subdivision road to the north where subout does touch their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:23| And as I mentioned before, there is a fairly large flat area on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| There's existing houses that are part of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Part of the subject site is zoned commercial, which is kind of down here in these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| That commercial zoning will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| They're not changing that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| And as mentioned, staff recommendation is for one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| For the density calculation, would that be a needed added condition of what's calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| or is that just what the staff does automatically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| The density for the hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Like the TVA line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Oh, the TVA, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| It'll just be through the development plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Yeah, we'll address that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3734)|
| 1:02:24| Mike, they can't access that Choteau Marina Way as opposed to the other access point north of there through that neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| Yeah, so the houses along the river are currently accessed through Choteau Marina Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| which is part of the driveway system for Choteau Marina, at least on the north side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| I guess it depends on what kind of development they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| and whether a true road or private right of way is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| That might make it a little more complicated to connect through that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| if a public road or a private right of way is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| So basically, if they're creating lots, they need to have either a private right of way or a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| At least two access points in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| Well, it may just only need one access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| Mike, would it be a requirement to, you know, we talked about connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| would it be a requirement of this development to hook through that other subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| There's nothing in our regulations saying that they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| I mean, it would be a consideration. It could be a consideration, but it wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| And is this zoning assuming septic systems or assuming a sewer system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| I think they are, well, right now there's not sewer to handle a larger, I guess compact style of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:17| They are looking at alternatives to septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Would it have any additional influence on how many units, whether or not it was septic or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| No, it's purely something outside of necessarily our view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| It would be working with the utility district and health department to figure that out, how they want to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| But, I mean, the most straightforward process is septic on larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| And then from there, sewer, and if there's other options available to them, they can seek that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner, I don't know if this was part of your question, is that it did influence our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| was the lack of sewer currently available on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| It did impact our, I mean, it was part of our considerations for our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| My question would be is, like, there was another subdivision that Chris Brown did not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| where he put in a system and it accommodated his whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| And it's not out of the reach to think that they could put a system in, but it wouldn't be reasonable with one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:30| But if they put a system in where it might work out where the utility company might maintain it or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| does that have an effect on the property units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| I'll ask Director Snowden or Mr. Elliott to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| There's been some conversations that have been had with the utility districts as we've gone through the growth policy plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Yeah, Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| We, as part of the growth policy amendment, we did add some language in there that if it's just a septic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:07| that requires very little to no maintenance, we're okay with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| But where you get into these private systems that do require routine maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and more permitting through the Department of Environment and Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| we would require the utility agency in this district, which would be First Utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| to confirm that they would maintain that in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| So just a follow-up on that, Director Snowden, and a clarification, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| I guess because the way I would see it is if you've got, it doesn't matter if it's KUB or West Knox Utility or First Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| I mean if they've got a utility district that's willing to maintain or take ownership of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| doesn't matter if it's a pump station or gravity sewer or some sort of sand filtration septic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4013)|
| 1:07:02| I guess in my opinion, I'm asking yours, I mean that's effectively, it's no burden on the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| It's not, if something goes wrong, they're going to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So I guess in my view, I would almost see that as the same as having gravity sewer or something along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Yes, we would assume as long as the utility provider, whomever it was, accepted long-term maintenance of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| we would consider that to essentially be a sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Whether it be a low-pressure sewer, gravity, or this, it would be one and the same in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Okay, we will move on to agenda item number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| And this is another one where we're recommending a density less than what's being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| Yes, so this is a request to rezone from agricultural to planned residential to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| It's on Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Staff is, we're recommending one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Basically because the planned residential zone allows clustering of units away from environmentally sensitive portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| And infrastructure improvements are needed before higher intensity zoning is established on Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| And I'll kind of go over that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| So there is quite a bit of single family in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| Very little of it, when I say single family, I mean like lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| This is the existing land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Very little of it has access to Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Most of them have access back to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| The existing zoning on Black Ferry Road is predominantly agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| There are a couple of exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| There is a small subdivision to the north that's planned residential, but three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| There's a small area zone RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| This is for a few lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| But everything else is in a small little section down just south of the subject property zone RA as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| The large subdivision to the south of the property has no access to Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| It's all internal back to West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| In the sector plan it's all low density in this general area including along Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| The property does have a little bit of hillside protection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Currently it's a farm property. It's an agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| The grains really aren't too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| It does have a stream that runs through the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| So no matter how you access the lot you're going to cross the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| You can see there is a little bit of hillside protection in the middle of the property and towards the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| It's nothing too steep, but it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| So Black Ferry Road itself is marginal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| It's 17 to 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| But the real problem is Black Ferry Road at Emory and particularly looking to the west, southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:10| You can see from this image, I mean really you'd be looking a little bit further back in this intersection through this hill at Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4210)|
| 1:10:19| You can see a vehicle just barely in the distance here on this curve which is about where this star is, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4219)|
| 1:10:29| By county standard the site distance would be 450 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| It's a 45 mile per hour road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| And you're looking straight through that hill back around that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| No way you're going to get that site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| Even at a lower speed there's a little sign on West Emory that says, hey watch out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Dangerous intersection ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Consider slowing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| That's not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| That's more advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| So if you went with 300 feet you're still looking through the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| You're not even to where that car is here in the image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| So really this intersection needs to be improved before we look at adding more intensity to Black Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| And that's the reason why we're suggesting one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| It would allow the clustering of units on the site still allow the same intensity for the most part that the Ag Zone currently allows, which is one house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Seeing no hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| We will move on to agenda item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| And this is another one that we are recommending a density less than what the applicant, Storm Shuler, is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| So this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| So this is in South County just southwest of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| There, so it does include a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Currently sector plan is agricultural, they're requesting rural residential, and then they're requesting to rezone from RB, general residential, and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:04| sector plan is agricultural. They're requesting rural residential and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| they're requesting to rezone from RB general residential and agricultural so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| about half it's about half and half with the zoning on the property now and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| want to go to plan residential up to two dwelling units per acre. Staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| recommending approval of the rural residential land use classification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| approval of plan residential zoning up to one dwelling unit per acre with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| condition of that a portion portion of the parcel delineated and exhibit B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| which I'll show you in a moment shall be left undisturbed which is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| the steep hillsides on the property. So as I mentioned there's it's about half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| and half for the zoning on the property RB it's about 40 acres agriculture about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| 44.5 acres the agricultural portion is predominantly the steeper parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| property but there is a good portion of the RB that's that's in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| projection area as well. Sector plan in this in the areas predominantly or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| know most essentially agricultural the agricultural and rural residential land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| use are fairly compatible with each other there's a small area low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| residential off of Highland View that that property is owned I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| plan residential up to 1.47 dwelling units per acre something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| like that. They've clustered all the units to the lower in the flatter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| portions of the site so I think their lot sizes are around 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| each or maybe just a little hair less than that but the density overall is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| much lower it's you know lower than 220 acre. Existing land use there is quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| bit smaller lots on this area especially just to the north you know excluding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| some of the newer subdivisions that have really small lots but these this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| has been developed since the 60s or so that is zoned RB it's about two and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| half towing is per acre excluding the right-of-way so he's kind of get an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| what size we're talking about. It's the quick aerial the site anything you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| with trees on it is deep anything without trees is relatively flat there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| is a potential stream through the property that cuts through the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| ridges and then to the north. And here's the hillside protection plan if we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:36| the two dwelling units per acre as a baseline the hillside protection would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| recommend or the slope analysis would recommend 1.36 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| From staff perspective we're more comfortable with one dwelling unit per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| acre on the site being in this rural character and general location. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:15:00| another criteria to look at so the growth policy plan has two criteria for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| allowing the density above one dwelling unit per acre. One is one we've used quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| often which is doing a traffic letter allow consideration up to three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| units per acre that's considered like an extension of low-density residential land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| use. There's another provision 3.3 that well 3.2 start with that just allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:31| consideration up to two dwelling units per acre in the rural area but then you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| to take into consideration 3.3 which has its own set of density restrictions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| steeper slopes but it doesn't use the hillside protection area it just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| all slopes on the property. So on a baseline I just kind of did a quick area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| calculation on some of these areas and I think it would be about 1.2 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| per acre is what the growth policy plan would recommend so it's not too far off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| of what the slope analysis already recommends. So the non-disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| as I mentioned before includes the larger Ridge to the on the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4574)|

| 1:18:02| cut out lots right? Correct. Current RB zoning allows single-family houses I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| think 10,000 square foot lots. So that's two and a half an acre or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| Probably somewhere around there. Okay. Duplexes are allowed with slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| larger lot sizes and then multifamily is also allowed. Right. Okay thanks. I've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| question that's not necessarily specific to this case but and I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| staff will know anything about this but just from a regional planning standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| I was told recently that Blount County had a big change with their zoning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| restricts it to only single-family or something like that and even like cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| out future subdivisions. I don't really know the details but I just didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| if maybe because this is so close to the line it kind of made me wonder if staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| knows anything about any recent changes in the region and is specifically in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| this area with Blount County zoning wise. That sounds familiar but I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| the details. It's real. Yeah. Loudoun County as well. Okay we'll move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4753)|

| 1:19:38| approved a plan for the site back in July 2023. Same number of dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4778)|

| 1:19:52| just a moment. So as I mentioned 46 attached houses what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| proposing that equals 11.91 dwelling units per acre. The property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| rezoned from planned residential up to 8 dwelling units per acre to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| residential to 12 dwelling units per acre in May of 2023. So that allows that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| little bit extra density. They are asking for a peripheral setback reduction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| the west boundary from 35 feet down to 20 feet and then on this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4815)|

| 1:20:34| with five conditions and there's one major condition that I'll go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| just a moment. So this was the previous plan. Their intent was to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| units for the most part in this kind of inside the driveway circle so they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| have a green space in the middle. There was a few more lots to the north. So you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| didn't have units that backed up quite as much to the external boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Decided to switch things up and go with a new site plan. There is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4862)|
| 1:21:11| landscape screening proposed what you see so that the trees that you do see on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4871)|

| 1:21:25| little bit in this northeast corner behind the two adjacent units. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| type C landscape screening is it's more of a distributed landscaping. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| going to create a consistent, you know, visual screen so it's more of a partial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| or so it's a partial screen. I thought that was more appropriate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| location but a more like a type B which would be more of a full screen could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| an option here as well. The architectural design is pretty much carried over from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240409-agenda-review?start=4911)|
