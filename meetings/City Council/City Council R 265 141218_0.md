| 0:00:00| Okay, good evening. I'll call this meeting to order. This is Knoxville City Council. Thursday, December 18th, 2014. This meeting would normally have been held on December 23rd, but thank you to Council. We don't have to come back the day before Christmas Eve. We're having this meeting tonight.

| 0:02:51| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to acknowledge the passing this week of two very significant figures, very colorful figures in our community. Gideon Fryer, who is known as the Bishop of Fort Sanders, who died at the age of 93. Wow. And Dauber Doyle, who some people called the Angel of Vestal, who died at the age of 96. Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=171)|
| 0:03:17| Gideon was a co-founder of the East Tennessee Community Design Center, among many other things. And if you had the pleasure of attending any of his parties and gatherings in Fort Sanders over the years, you know how warm and enthusiastic and inquisitive he was about this city and the world in general. He really brought people together and really built a community of friends and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=197)|
| 0:03:38| Dauber Doyle did much the same thing in his role as unofficial Ambassador of Vestal at King Tut's Grill. You know, he was known to give flowers to the ladies and if the music came on, he would dance with the ladies. And I was one of those who he danced with one time. A wonderful guy. So both Dauber and Gideon lived long lives. They had long lives. They were well lived. And Knoxville will miss both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=218)|
| 0:04:08| This is the final council meeting of 2014. And I want to note that yesterday, December 17th, marked the third anniversary of my taking office and four of you who also ran that year. It's hard to believe it's already been three years. For me, it seems to have flown by. I hope it seemed that way to you. But we're looking forward to this coming year and continuing to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=248)|
| 0:04:38| We do have a few more events on the city calendar this year that I want to remind everybody about. Tomorrow, Friday the 18th, the 8th annual Tour de Lights holiday bicycle ride will depart from Market Square at 7 p.m. You can arrive any time after 6 p.m. for registration and bicycle decoration judging. Do we have any council members on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=278)|
| 0:05:01| I know we've got some bike riders. I will be visiting my latest grandbaby, so I will not be here. But there's always a lot of fun. This is the first year. It is an official part of our Christmas in the City calendar. So bring your bikes, your jingle bells, your Santa hats and whatever festive gear you prefer. Again, that's Friday the 18th at 7 p.m. at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=301)|
| 0:05:27| And in two weeks, we'll once again have a New Year's Eve celebration and ball drop on Market Square. The countdown will begin at 11 p.m. and the Holidays on Ice skating rink will be open extra late that night so you can skate right into 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=327)|
| 0:05:43| And one more holiday note. City offices will be closed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. We're kind to our employees. We close on Christmas and New Year's. And of course, I want to wish everyone Happy Holidays. Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=343)|
| 0:06:00| And finally, we have some special guests who are here tonight from the TEMA, from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and from our fire department to make a short presentation. And I'd like for those to come on down. I want to introduce David Perkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=360)|
| 0:06:20| And David Perkey, he's got several titles. I'm very impressed here. The Director of TEMA, Deputy Commissioner of the Military Department of Tennessee, Governor Haslam's Homeland Security Advisor and Assistant Commissioner for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. That's pretty impressive. That means you get a lot of work. They get a lot of work out of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=380)|
| 0:06:46| I do. And Mayor, if you'll remember your predecessor, he is a man of economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| That's right. I was about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| He has taken full advantages of state government vacancies to assign other duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| But also, he was the long-term mayor of Hamlin County. So Mayor, it was nice to have you here. So I'm going to hand the program over to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=418)|
| 0:07:08| Mayor, thank you. And members of council, Vice Mayor Pavlis, a long-time friend of mine, it's good to be with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| What a pleasure it is to be able to do what we're about to do in a public setting at a city council meeting or as a county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| We did important things in front of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| And we have an important presentation to make tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| Let me take this opportunity to introduce the team of leadership that traveled with me from Nashville to make the presentation, also the regional leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| Behind me is our Deputy Director, Dewey Woody, who is a former fire chief himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| Assistant Director of Preparedness, Kim Davis, who was a police chief in Jefferson City, not far from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| Charlie Bryant, our Assistant Director of Recovery is ill and could not be with us tonight, but he had a lot to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I'm sorry he couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Craig Hanrahan, who is our team of Field Services Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Bill Wirth, who is our Regional Administrator for East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| And our team of District Coordinator, Bob Crane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Before I describe what we're about to do, I want to thank some other parties in Knoxville who really helped with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=493)|
| 0:08:24| I was afraid that I'd be remiss in not mentioning, so I appreciate the opportunity to do that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| But the presentation that we're going to make to the Knoxville Fire Department tonight is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| And it could not have happened without the assistance of others in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| KPD, Chief Roush, Chief Holliday, good to be with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Your City Services Department, Public Works, was heavily involved in the preparations for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| And also officials and staff at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| Let me just divert from my prepared remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| This is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Tonight we're here to present the men and women of the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Chief Stan Sharp and his command staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| with the designation as the first CBRN HazMat certified team in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=554)|
| 0:09:25| Other teams have tried and failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Other teams have thought about doing this across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| But they didn't want to make the commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| There will be other teams to follow because you all have set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| And I can't tell you how important it is to me as a native of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| to be able to come before you tonight and present this to the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| Hazardous materials is a very difficult area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Anyone in public safety will tell you that those events are very volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| They deal with public safety issues that affect lives and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| and also the safety of the public safety personnel on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| Back in the late 70s, before the advent of professional HazMat training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| we had a large explosion in West Tennessee in Waverly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| We had fatalities and a lot of injuries from that explosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And that really, Chief, was the advent of the modern HazMat training statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| Your department has taken the steps working with these other entities to be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| And it's been my experience after 34 years in local and state government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| that good public safety doesn't just happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| It takes a commitment from the leadership of the departments and the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and it certainly takes the leadership of the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| I commend you as mayor and city council members for supporting your police and fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| I love to talk to other people in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| and talk to them about the level of support that you give to the Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| It's unparalleled in some of the other major areas that we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| So, Chief, I would ask you to come forward and anyone else that you want to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=678)|
| 0:11:32| I'm pleased, as I said, to present the first level one CBRN HazMat team certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| to Chief Stan Sharp and the men and women of the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| A job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=707)|
| 0:12:02| Also, Chief, we have a plaque from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| that will signify always that on this date that you all were the first in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| Again, others will follow, but this one's very special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Congratulations again, my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| What we'd like is to get the HazMat team, all of our guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and we're going to come up here and take a group picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Council would indulge us here for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Those are the guys that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| Ricky Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| If you're not first, you're last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| One of the famous words of the famous philosopher, Ricky Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| He said, if you're not first, you're last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=778)|
| 0:13:09| What's up, Bryce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Is it 34? Is it 35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| Hold on, we've got Dan up top here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=804)|
| 0:13:37| Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=824)|
| 0:14:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| I just want to take a minute to acknowledge a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| First of all, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you, Mayor and City Council, for giving us this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| to recognize our HazMat team and for the accomplishments that they've made this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| I also want to thank Commissioner Perkey and all his team of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| for coming down here all the way from Nashville just to present this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| Like he said, it is a big deal, and it's been a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| on the part of our HazMat team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| It's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| They've had to do a lot of training and a lot of preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| and they accomplished it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Again, it was a lot of teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| It wasn't just the fire department, but as Commissioner Perkey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| we had a lot of help from a lot of other departments in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| and a lot of other agencies, including KEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| the Knox County Emergency Management Agency, which they're represented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| But finally, the last thing I want to do is thank all the members of our HazMat team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| for all their dedication, their professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| and all the hard work that they've done to bring us to this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| but not only for that, for what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| And the fire department will also be recognizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| All of them will be receiving an individual certificate of appreciation for their hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and also a unit citation for the work they did as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=922)|

| 0:15:48| We do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| I do have one person who wanted to be here and could not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| and sent a short little paragraph here and asked me to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| It's from Kevin Faddis, who is the president of the Firefighters Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| On behalf of the Knoxville Firefighters Association Local 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| we would like to recognize and thank the members of the city of Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| for their dedication and hard work on obtaining the only Level 1 CBRNE accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=971)|
| 0:16:23| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| With Knoxville's interstates and rail system serving as a major corridor for many companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| as well as having many offload sites and storage facilities within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| this accreditation will serve the community as well as the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| with the preparedness level and expertise that Knoxville has never seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| So again, we thank all of you for this accomplishment and for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| Okay, that ends the mayor's report, and so we'll move on to council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I've got two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| The first, there's going to be a public property naming committee on January 5th at 530,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| so if you know anybody that's thinking about submitting an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| tell them to go ahead and get it in and get on the January 5th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| That's going to be at 530 in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| And in the spirit of first responders, I wanted to recognize a young member of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| two workers of 911 and the police department and specifically the safety city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| and the programming and education they do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| So if Josie Zavala and the Moody's could come down to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1059)|
| 0:17:49| Ms. Zavala, would you like to tell council what happened and why you're here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| My babysitter, we saw her and she wasn't really responding to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1076)|
| 0:18:06| so I grabbed her phone and I dialed 911, and then they came and they took her to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1086)|
| 0:18:17| Where did you learn about calling 911?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Safety city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| And thanks for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| And the Moody's, would one of you all like to discuss the program and what exactly happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| Well, actually, we both are training specialists for Knox County 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| and we work at safety city with children, second graders every day through the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| And she was in Jack's class. We alternate teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| She was in Jack's class, and when I saw it on the news, I thought she needed to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| And I appreciate you, Mr. Stare, and I talked to Mr. Saunders about this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| but I really appreciate Mayor Rojero and all his council supporting us through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| because it is a good program and it works, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| And we don't know how many might have already done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| and didn't come to the news media to let us know, but we appreciate all you've done for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| And I think the mayor has some certificates of recognition for Ms. Zavala and the Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| I think I just wanted to highlight, you know, the police department talks about doing the little things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| to make our community safer, and I think this is a great example of the city working with the 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and working with the young people in our community to, you know, to perhaps save this babysitter's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| So I just wanted to recognize them, and thank you, Mayor, for presenting the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| All right. Well, thank you, Councilman Stare, for bringing this to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| and for scheduling this on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| So this is a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| It says, The City of Knoxville, by Her Honor the Mayor, Madeline Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| is pleased to recognize Josie Zavala for her bravery, dedication, and quick actions in August 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| A second-grade student at Enskip Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| Josie Zavala and her six-year-old brother were being cared for by a babysitter in their home on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| The babysitter became ill and passed out, so Josie used the sitter's cell phone to call E911 for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| Josie demonstrated exceptional courage and selflessness for her actions in saving her babysitter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| by remembering what she learned from Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| The City of Knoxville is pleased to present her with this Certificate of Merit, December 18, 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| and she's here to accept it with her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| So why don't you come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Stare, you want to come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| You stay, yeah, we're going to get you in here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Do you want to read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Councilman Stare, yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1254)|
| 0:21:05| She's cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you, Josie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| And Josie's a great example of what our kids are learning due to people like the Moody's, so Jack and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| You all know Jack and May Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| They have been active in our community in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Come on, May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| And they are active in their neighborhood in the Norwood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| and I'm sure we've rerun into them all kinds of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| They do good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| So we also wanted to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Jack was actually the instructor the day that Josie was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| May looked that up and figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| So actually, Jack, we want to thank you for your great training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| but we know that May does that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| So I also have two Certificates of Recognition, a Certificate of Merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| to both of you for your dedication in empowering elementary school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| by teaching good safety habits as a training specialist for Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| So this is for Jack, and this is for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| I want to say that this makes us so proud to know that what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| makes a bearing on younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| But not only our teaching, but the rest of Safety City is just as important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| because they learn all kinds of safety facts from bicycles to cars to pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| fire safety, and it's a wonderful program, and not many cities have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| and it's something to be very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Councilman, Mayor, if you could indulge me for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| The Executive Director of Safety City, Vicki Dagnon, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| and she has a special gift for Josie too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1371)|
| 0:23:04| The Knoxville Police Department and Safety City are dedicated to saving the lives of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| especially our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| We want to take this opportunity to recognize Josie for taking those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| that she learned at Safety City a step further in helping to save someone else's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| So we hope that you will accept this gift bag from the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1409)|
| 0:23:42| While the mayor is walking back, the Moody's also spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| helping Citizens Police Academy, and anybody that has an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| should try to take advantage of it and learn what our police department does firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| That's right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| So this is the season of giving and caring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| so thank you for giving us this opportunity to recognize these wonderful folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| in our community and young Josie and her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| So now any other reports of counsel? Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| I don't know how you followed that. I wish I had gone first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| But I was just going to say that my quarterly coffee with the councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1456)|

| 0:25:24| Requested by council members Campin, Brown, and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Councilman Villalobbe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Well, I want to commend these councilmen for being concerned about the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| I was a little concerned when I read some of the information in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| My guess is that none of the sponsors nor anyone else on this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| has read 30,000 scientific papers on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| Pavlis and I both read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| He did read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Together we read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| He had it on his iPhone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And what I was trying to say was that I commend our government agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| for looking forward at this issue, but I get concerned when I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and I guess it's not in the actual resolution, it's in the AIS, the information sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| reducing carbon pollution by 80% in the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| I mean, I don't know what that involves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| but it could involve a great loss of jobs and costs to industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| and I'm glad to see that that's not in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Again, I commend you for being concerned about climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and working on environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| We need to be careful as both the city and the general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| of not hamstringing ourselves because we have a competitive position in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| that we need to keep and foster because it affects all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| I just want to throw that out, and maybe that's just fluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| I guess without a healthy planet, we can't have many jobs either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| That's true. It's a nice balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Well, I think that brings up the point that what we have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| through our sustainability efforts and at the local level, the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| the national folks that we spoke with, Aaron Gill is in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| I mean, he's in the room here as the director of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| It is all about balance, finding that balance, pushing ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I believe we have to push ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| We have to address the long-term effects of how we live today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| and how we make sure that we do have jobs and beauty, natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| all of that in the future, but it's not clear-cut exactly what you do when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| There are always tradeoffs, but what we've seen as a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and what we've certainly seen as a community is continuing to push that envelope to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| We've cut our own greenhouse gas emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| We are providing ways for people to live healthier and to live in a cleaner environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| and we've really been on the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| We were recognized as a climate action champion, one of 16 cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| because we are on the forefront in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I think all of this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| We are always balancing, trying to weigh the costs, and I have to tell you too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| when I ran for mayor in 2003, you know, the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| at that point the talk was so much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| I was saying, you know, we've got economic developers in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| we've got environmentalists in this room, and they don't think they can coexist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| You know, it was a, you know, and so now they've come closer together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and we realize that we have to coexist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Our future, our economic future, our economic prosperity depends on coexisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| and on making sure that we are promoting a cleaner environment, a healthier environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| And that's what, in fact, you know, we have been doing for several years here in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| and we are joined by people across the country who are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So I really do, both Erin Gill and I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| and my administration appreciates that council brought this resolution showing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| for basically what we are doing already in the national effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| and regional efforts that we've been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| So is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend the contract number C14114| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| with Quantum Environmental and Engineering Services, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| for the Lakeshore Park Assessment and Demolition Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| increasing the contract amount by $120,000 for a new contract total of $717,880| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| and extending the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Yeah, I just wanted to say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| One, certainly the progress has been outstanding out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| I live close by and have been by there numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| And I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I think it's pertinent to say on these two, this one and the next resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| that we're still well under our original estimate and budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| Your original demolition budget came in way under what you thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| and even with these add-ons and probably some other add-ons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| you're still way under budget, right, Mr. Ackerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Yes, just make a comment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| I think that's important to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| The progress has been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I mean, we've been able to, as unexpected as that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| we've been able to fund because the bids did come in lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and we've been able to add work that we didn't think we'd be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| because of our concerns on what the price would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| And I think the reminder on tying in what you were just talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| this particular contractor came in less because he was able to recycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| so much of the material out there, which is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| And you see these big buildings come down, and the steel and the concrete in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and they're able to recycle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| I mean, it's all part of what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| and I think it's a very important fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| and it's probably a lot of that's been overlooked by a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| And we will have a full report on all of that, what all's been recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| It is dramatic, the percentage of materials that have been taken down there and recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| So we'll have a full report on that at the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| And you go out there and you see these huge piles of steel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| and they're taking the time and the delicacy to set it aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and keep setting it aside and then see it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| And, of course, that's part of their bid, the salvage value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Right. That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| A lot of that same stuff is happening across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We watch it every day as Baptist is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| There's so much that's being recycled, reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1902)|

| 0:31:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=1905)|

| 0:34:22| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Yeah, I don't know if Janet's here, but maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| If you could just step up and just tell us a bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I remember we approved the first acquisition, and I didn't know if we had any field experience on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| and what we're learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| In other words, we're jumping in a little deeper, but is it working and are there any issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| It's actually working very well, and thanks for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| We started off with the fleet department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| They have two shops at two locations, and we put the time clocks in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| and the time clocks actually work with the same cards, the same type of cards that we use to access the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And so the employees, instead of using the manual punching the cards in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| they simply just touch this electronic time device, and then it's hooked into the payroll system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| so it's all automated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Nobody's entering time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| So it's worked extremely well, so we want to take it to the next level to public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| and do all of their employees, and that's why we have seven time clocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| So instead of multiple entries and bookkeeping and clerks, once it's entered electronically, it just works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| It's electronic, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| 11-I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Acela Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| for implement the first phase of a comprehensive city-wide work order management software system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| in an amount not to exceed $980,559.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Yes, I guess we're going to drag her back for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Oh, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| She anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| I understand that this is going to enable our people to have the work order information on a computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and put their observations and take care of everything without having to run back to the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| and do 7 million steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| My question is, has this particular system been tested in other cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| I mean, what's the experience behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Yes, it has been tested in many other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| In fact, Louisville is undergoing the same implementation that we are at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| It's been implemented several places in Florida, Arizona, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Acela, the company that we've chosen, is one of the premier companies that do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| it's called asset management really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| We're calling it work order management because it's easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| But this will be replacing our 311 system where we have complaints entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| It will be replacing our legacy public service work order system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| It will be replacing our inventory system and upgrading our codes enforcement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| So it's a big, this is phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| It's a big effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| And our goal is to be able to manage whatever work is going on within the city using this computer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| because it will all be in the same system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| So it will be very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Different groups can actually access the same work order and coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| They can coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| They can see each other's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| It's graphical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| They can see on a map where work is being performed in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| They'll have field devices where they can close their work orders quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| and see what new work orders may have popped up that they may have to go schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| to do those right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So I think it's going to have a lot of advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| One of the other big things that we're going to do in this system is we are going to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| all of our existing business processes as we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| So we're not going to just automate the way we do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Is that an efficiency thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Yes, and that's what we hope to gain out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| It's lots of efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Being able to, you know, see what works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| and measure our labor costs and our material costs very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| The only thing that I wanted to follow up on was you said something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| and I don't think you meant it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| but we're not replacing the 311 system in terms of having a real human voice answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| if you're a citizen calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| We're replacing the software system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| We're not replacing the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| They'll still be answering the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| I think 311's been a great service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| That's really an asset, I think, to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Janet, so Phase 1 is close to a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| How long will it take you to implement it, and what is Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| and when do we expect to see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| It'll take us about 12 months to implement Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| This is funded by capital project money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| We set aside $1.5 million to do both the new work order system and also an AVL system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| We did implement a small portion of the AVL system this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| We put devices on 100 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Now, Phase 2, as we creep in and bring in other departments, for instance, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| civil engineering, stormwater, traffic engineering, building inspections will also be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| So we hope that at least the work that's being accomplished in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| the main work that's being done, we'll be able to view it with this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So that will be Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| And Phase 2, when do you think it will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| A year from now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| A year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| I'll be back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Also, I'll be back before you at some point in time on Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| What we don't like to do is buy all of our software licenses up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| And so as we go live with Phase 1, we'll be coming back to you to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| okay, now we're ready to get some more software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| That'll be about another $200,000 at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| So that's still part of Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| And then Phase 2 will be about a million as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| I mean, it's a big change for management, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I mean, so you have the devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| You know where things are going on and how they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| But that's going to change how people work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| So I would assume there's a tremendous amount of management training behind that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| There's going to have to be a lot of training and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I think Director Brace is here tonight and can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| They are very excited about this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| and are looking forward to having this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| And it's a wonderful management tool to be able to view what's going on and measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| When I asked him before, he was fired up about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| So I was like, okay, well, the ROI is going to be good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| That's kind of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2473)|

| 0:41:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| 11J is a resolution to amend Resolution No. R397-214,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| entitled a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2483)|

| 0:41:40| in furtherance of the public purposes of the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| as defined in TCA Section 7-53-305| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2503)|

| 0:41:52| and 128 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| 12A is an ordinance to extend the provisions of Chapter 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Article 5, Division 2 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| regarding commercial pedal carriages through December 31, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| Bill, move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Yeah, I don't know if Patricia is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| I'd like to talk to her for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Patricia, I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| what has happened so far in terms of the pedal carriages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| I don't seem to bump into them very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| but I know we're extending it for a year under this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Tell us how it's working and what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I am Patricia Robledo in the Office of Business Support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| and I have Dr. Moore here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| who is the owner of the pedal carriage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and came to me and asked me to help her extend that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| She has not been able to really get going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| and it ends December 31st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and so we thought giving her a home next year to get going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| might really do the trick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Could she maybe tell us her goals and what she wants to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Nikki Moore-Williams, Gatlinburg, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Yeah, part of the issue has been we've had more interest in doing the Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| and wanting to go across Gay Street Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and because of the construction on Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| and the traffic diversions and different interferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| we didn't get the approval for that until like late October of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| So we're hoping that now that we're approved to go across the Gay Street Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| which is going to be a spectacular ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| that's going to bring more interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| We've had lots of folks interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| We started with an approval to come up Fort Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| That is one really steep hill to have to pedal up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| And we've done some tours downtown, different ones around Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| and we did take a bunch of young lady vet students from the vet school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| and they managed to make it up with some guys on the bike, but it was tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| So we've waited until we could get it at a less severe incline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| But we've got some places booked coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| We've done most of our work because we are also in Pigeon Forge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| We've done a lot of tours in Pigeon Forge too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| kind of waiting to get all the details taken care of here in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| It's a little flatter there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| It is a little flatter, yes it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| The hills are a little longer too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| But with this new approval from Chief Roush, which we're very glad to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| hopefully we'll be able to start getting some in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| when the weather accommodates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| We're now at the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| We have one person signed up, Ms. Vivian Scheip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Ms. Scheip, please come forward, state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and as you know I'll set the timer and you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Dress for Christmas too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| We've come to the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| 2014 has proven in many ways to be a most successful year for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| However, Tuesday night I attended the sixth annual memorial for the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| that died in the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| I did not see any of you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| The bells tolled for 21 people whose names we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| and for those who died unknown, most buried in a pauper's field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Yes, the homeless live among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| This year we have seen them sighted and ran off the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| and anywhere else they may seek help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| They are homeless, but they are no less human than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I am asking you to come back next year with a renewed commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| to do better in three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Number one, when you sight the homeless, look beyond what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| and try to see who they are and what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Number two, stop letting the mayor and Chief Roush be the only faces we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| in the media or in the newspaper going into the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| and talking to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Get out in your own districts and see the need of your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Three, we ask that you publicize the dates and the times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| of the mayor's round table on homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| so that the public can attend the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| to hear what you are saying and see what you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| and not cast off as a bother or insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Early in my fight to help the mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| I was told by several people these old ways of carrying signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| and marching as a collective, they don't work today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| because you can't get enough people together to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| and show that they care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| But I come to bring you a prophecy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| There is a tsunami building in this country, in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| and in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| You shall see it sweep across this great land in waves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| You have not seen it since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265141218?start=2834)|
