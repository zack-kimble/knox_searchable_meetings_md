| 0:06:26| Diolch yn fawr iawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Okay. Under the Mayor's report I have a couple of things. First of all I want to remind everyone of the small business conference that will be held on Wednesday, this Wednesday, March the 9th at Pellissippi State Community College Magnolia Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=387)|
| 0:06:52| Tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Yes. Yes, tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| The 2011 version of the event is set for 8.30 a.m. or 8.30 until noon. It's free and it's aimed at helping small businesses better compete for government contracts and other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=417)|
| 0:07:15| I also want to speak about the great weekend downtown and about the flooding. Despite the threatening weather, First Friday and the Dog Parade brought folks to downtown from all over the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=435)|
| 0:07:32| And our public service folks and city engineering work incredibly hard to remove debris and otherwise dealt with the aftermath of the flooding. We appreciate everyone's hard work. The public service department has suspended brush collection routes for one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=452)|
| 0:07:52| That started Monday, March the 7th, in order to assist the households affected by Monday's flood event with the collection of flood-damaged debris and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=472)|
| 0:08:06| I also need to recognize 12 members of the Great Smoky Mountain Council Boy Scout Troop Number 20 from First Cumberland Presbyterian Church, if you all would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=486)|
| 0:08:31| Did anyone want to come down and say anything? All right. Well, thank you for coming. We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=511)|
| 0:08:43| Are there any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Council Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you. For those who have long awaited the widening of State Route 62, also known as Western Avenue or Oak Ridge Highway, it's actually occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=531)|
| 0:09:02| And for those who want to follow the progress of detours or construction or get an overview, TDOT now has a website, tdot.state.ten.us backslash sr62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=542)|
| 0:09:16| And I went to the website today, and it gives a really good overview of what will be occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| And it will be updated. There's a little menu at the top to update on any detours or things that will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| So that's a plus for all of us. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| All right. Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you, Mayor Brown. I just wanted to reference an initiative that I'm getting ready to launch in the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| And I hope that my compadres on Council, particularly those that have a real interest in these upcoming elections, will follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=581)|
| 0:09:50| And I'm going to call it 11-in-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And what I want to charge the people of the First District to do is to get 11 people registered to vote and make sure that those 11 people go vote come election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=593)|
| 0:10:03| We're going to elect a mayor and four council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| And there's been apathy in this city when it comes to the amount of folks that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| And I think it's, you know, important for me to lead that charge in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| And I'm going to really promote it at Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Every time I get a chance in my district to promote that, then I'm going to take the chance to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Folks will be outside of Kroger's and all the different vendors and what have you throughout South Knoxville signing people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| So it's going to be a big effort and hopefully very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| And I would urge, you know, a lot of folks to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| I just wanted to mention again that on March the 17th, here in the large assembly room at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| we're going to have a workshop on the council redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And the public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| So I urge you to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| I just wanted to tell the folks out in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| especially those that live along the Broadway corridor and Cedar Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| and have been suffering with the heavy rainfall that came down there and flooded First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| and some of the tributaries, that our stormwater people are looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| And I know we're getting another horrendous rainfall here today, but they're doing what they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| Mother Nature can be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| As we get a lot of rain in a short period of time, we're going to have some flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Be mindful in your own properties to, you know, clear gutters, clear passageways for water to travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| and keep it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| But it's been a tough time, and they're a little bit overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| But call in to 311, report the problem, give them the address, give them a chance to go out and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| And thank you for being patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| It's along the lines of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| As an explanation, I may have had some constituents have tried to call me in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Actually, my landline at my house where I field constituents' calls was actually knocked out by the flooding for about five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| So if anyone's been trying to get through, it's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| It's been working very well for the last two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| So I just wanted to let you know that's what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=744)|

| 0:13:57| If I can add a word to that, I was going to say that I thought the level of professionalism that the Chief has brought to the force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| has really made noticeable and effective improvements, and we're all better for it here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=845)|
| 0:14:13| I was at a Civitan meeting years ago, and I remember him coming there in his dress blues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and one of the things they say every morning is to do your best every day and to treat others like you'd want to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| And I think that sense of professionalism and being part of a team has been a healthy thing for our police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and we appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=871)|

| 0:14:48| He's leaving shoes to fill, and I feel comfortable we'll be moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| but certainly all the council members who want to join this, I would applaud that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=893)|

| 0:15:09| and since I've been here, I've noticed the attitude and morale with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| and the community relations, and he's done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| He's trained and taught the police department well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=919)|

| 0:15:40| You came in and revived a culture, and the culture is a culture of performance and excellence and integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=940)|
| 0:15:50| and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I will just add that in addition to Chief Owen's service to the community and his role as Chief of Police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| he has also served our community and the state at large extraordinarily well in a number of volunteer capacities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| particularly this year as president of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| He and I have served together on that executive committee for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| He was the vice president when I served as president last year, and as a good police officer should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| he always had my back, and I will be forever grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| And before we vote on it, I think it would be good to give the chief a standing ovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=988)|
| 0:16:57| Chair, we entertain a motion on that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| And moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I know any opposers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| And thank you very much, Chief, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| And we'll be having a reception for the chief, I believe, on March the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| So we'll have some more information on that forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| You've been smiling a lot more lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| Do you notice that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| He's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| 11D is a resolution respectfully requesting and urging the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| and other appropriate administration officials to ensure that the mayor's pension task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| reflects by gender and minority background the composition of city employees slash retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| and further requesting that all meetings of the pension task force be advised and open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Requested by Council Members Palmer and Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I have a statement to make on that resolution and have a prepared statement I would like to read to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1073)|
| 0:18:03| A number of weeks ago I asked Bill Lyons to chair and Larry Martin to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| and to serve as a representative of the administration in forming a task force whose charge was to deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| and to report back to me any recommendations to ensure that the pension system was kept sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1097)|
| 0:18:26| My intention has been to consider these recommendations and pass them on to the new mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| who will take office in December of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| He or she could then determine whether to recommend that the incoming council consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| whether to place any changes to the charter on the 2012 ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| I'm supporting Bill and Larry and continue to support them as they determine the best manner in which to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1128)|
| 0:18:57| And since they've been working diligently on that, I want to ask Dr. Lyons if he has a statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1137)|
| 0:19:07| And also Larry Martin if he has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you, Mayor Brown, and thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| And thanks, everybody, for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| I see we have an awful lot of city employees here, understand the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And I think it's a very important question that we address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| As Mayor Brown mentioned, we have a statement that we have passed out to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| And I'm not, I assure you, I'm not going to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| But I'd like to take a few minutes to go over our thinking on this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| and address some of the points that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| And I don't think it would be at all improper to have a bit of a dialogue on this if council feels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| because we certainly understand all the emotions for everybody on this and want to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| First, I'll speak for a moment of why did Mayor Brown ask us to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| That's because right now the current projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| and even under assumptions that we would consider to be optimistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| show that our pension is headed toward a point where to keep it actuarially sound is going to be really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1196)|
| 0:20:04| Just the amount that the city would have to put in, assuming an 8% growth rate in 2014, would be $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| As you all know, there's a substantial amount that's put in now, but nowhere near this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| And we're looking to going toward $30 million in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| We're not in dire straits yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| And we don't want to be in a position where we're pushing the panic button and doing anything too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| That's why we think this is the time to engage this question and not get to the point of some other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| and cities that we see around the country where lines are drawn and rhetoric becomes heated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| and people are looking to address situations under incredible pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| So we appreciate the leadership of Mayor Brown in asking us to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| He asked us to lead and serve on a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| and I've been pleased and proud to work with Larry Martin on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| We've had experience working in a related, not exactly the same, but a very related matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| which we'll reference some when this is the Mercer task force to make sure that city employees were compensated appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| which we took very seriously, and I think the results of that were very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| I want to make one thing clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Most cities who take this on, the executives, just go ahead and make a recommendation to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| We decided it's best to take a task force approach and get everybody at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| and we're talking about representatives of employee groups at the table from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| That's what we've been committed to, and we'll speak a little bit more to that as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| The fundamental principle, and I want to be clear on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| that drove us as we went into this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Fairness to retirees and employees, recognizing the pensions that they have earned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| and respecting fundamental burden placed on taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| Both of those things have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| The goal is keeping the pension sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Every one of us has an interest in keeping the pension sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| and I think that's something that we absolutely have to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| given the fact of the fiscal pressures that we see on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Okay, now let's get into some of the things that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We have proposed having public educational sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| where all the bases of the financial underpinnings of the system were presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| having some work sessions with everybody in the room, employee representatives in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| to have give and take over various proposals and discuss the merits and demerits of each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| have public update sessions, and then have a final public report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| After which, as Mayor Brown said, he would take whatever the report may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| and by the way, we have absolutely nothing presumed going into this, neither Larry or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| We speak about this regularly, nor anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| We have a blank slate as to what, if anything, we might come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| At that point, we would make that presentation to Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| who, as he said, would pass that on to the next mayor who is elected, take office in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| for consideration actually of the next pension board and the next council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and if anything were going to happen, eventually be put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| and then to have a public vote on it, if that's in fact where we want, sometime in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| This is, there are many, many points of public access, discussion, decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| that would stem from what we would put on at the beginning to start this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| No policy was ever going to be made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| Nothing close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| No deliberation of any elected official was going to be taking place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Nothing close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| This is putting things out for consideration, involving everybody at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| pension board representatives, employees, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| and some experts to help us as we deliberated upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Now, it's been, a number of people have raised a number of questions understandably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Tennessee Open Meetings Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Tennessee Open Meeting Act does not apply to groups put together by the mayor to advise the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| It applies to groups put together by council to advise council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| and as we all know, it applies to deliberations of council or any other legislative, local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| It's written that way for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| The executive branch has got to be able to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| It is not the lawmaking branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| It is not a deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| The deliberative body is council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| That's where the Open Meetings Act applies, and those who advise council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| The executive branch has to be able, whether it's the governor, the president, a mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| has to be able to seek advice and counsel and to do so in an atmosphere that can lead to give and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| and to advise the policies going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| I don't think, I know there are people from the League of Women Voters here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| I would take it that they would be especially sensitive to the importance of a functioning executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| and a recognition of what the roles of each, under the separation of powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| of what each of our branches of government need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Now, does that mean because it's not covered that we don't open meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| My colleague Chris Woodall here, we were requested by, when Bill Haslam was mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| to advise him on what we might do with all the situation involving Fifth and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| You're all probably familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| We brought together a task force not covered by the Open Meetings Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Not only did we make those open, advertise them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| you can still go today and see every bit of deliberation on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| We believe that transparency means not only discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| but making all of the information publicly accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| We didn't do that because it was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| We did that because we decided that was the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| giving the context and led to a better public outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| On the other hand, Mayor Haslam asked Larry Martin and I to serve on the Mercer Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| which is, I think, everybody in here realizes what the Mercer Task Force was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| The Mercer Task Force recommended, I think successfully, we advocated fully during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| a comprehensive plan to bring employee salaries up to competitive levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| That Mercer Task Force met in work sessions completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| There were no open meetings of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Not anybody ever raised that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Why did we do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| We did it that way for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| The nature of the task at hand meant that we wanted to avoid people digging into a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| We wanted to avoid framing as administration versus uniformed services versus general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| We wanted an atmosphere where we could work together toward that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I think the end we came up with was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| I think the method we used fit that and led to a successful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| Now, the deliberations, what did we plan in our deliberations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| I think I've gone over that, so I won't repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| But what we planned to do was utilize a model of deliberation that we think was appropriate for the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1620)|
| 0:27:11| And that is some ability to get not in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Nothing is in secret when all the stakeholders are in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| No secrecy, but a place where we could engage in a discussion of the pros and cons of various alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| and this is exactly what our thinking was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| without anybody having to fear a position being attributed to them while it was being explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| I think all of us realize what the atmosphere can be in very sensitive discussions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| This is something we could avoid in Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| What do I mean by positional thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Well, unfortunately, what seems to, if we don't watch it, will fall into today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Council versus the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Employees, some employees versus other groups of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Employees versus administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| People digging in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| That is not a recipe for reaching the kind of consensus that we would like to emerge with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| to place before the public and say, we've all looked at this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| and here is a solution we together think would be suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Now, we made a choice that we thought was the method to get us to that successful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| Now, that means a few of the meetings when we had work sessions would not be open for everybody to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| So then you have to weigh, since we have a bias and a presumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| and everybody who has watched us operate over the last ten years, inside and prior to be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| knows we have pushed the envelope to open us every step of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and think that it's absolutely appropriate and have a total bias toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| In this case, we weighed what exactly is the relative gain and loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| of having the ability to have those frank discussions versus what would the public miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| The public would miss the information Larry Martin suggested that we look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| maybe the cost of living could be put at a different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Let's see what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Or person X said, that's a really bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| The public would not have access to that level of what we would almost call voyeuristic detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| We don't quite, so without that, we think that that's all that would be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| Not here are the recommendations, here are the arguments in favor for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| here is the discussion about their pros and cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| and then the public deliberation begins from there on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| In a deliberative setting, by the body that's structured to deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| which is council, advised by whoever the council wants to be advised that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| but those would have to be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| So that is what our thinking was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Now, unfortunately, we've got ourselves into what we call a deteriorating atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| which is not helpful to any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Positional thinking, again, we have found ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| we found ourselves being attributed positions and motives which are just not helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| and not appropriate and do not fit what our approach is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| We do not have any agenda other than sustainability of the pension system and fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| That's the only agenda, and fairness and consideration of the taxpayer all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Let me talk about how the task force was created for just a second, and I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| The two of us plus 12 other people, six of these people, we've left the employee groups to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| We think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| In my past life, I'm a political scientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| I'm also from the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| You don't like people telling you who your leaders are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| You don't like the administration picking somebody to represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Folks choose their own representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| I think that's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| The folks who ended up from the employee groups were chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Of the remaining, we had volunteers, retiree, long active, long active, Mr. Warwick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| long active as an advocate for employee rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| He was the retiree who volunteered, and we thought that he would be a good choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| We also chose three people who we recruited, two for specific expertise on financial matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| That's been criticized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I don't think we should be apologetic about having a major land grant research university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and drawing on the expertise of the head of the finance department and the accounting department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| to aid us as we consider these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| We also chose a representative to represent the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| That was the basis upon which we staffed this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| So since then, and I won't go too much, I think I've referenced some of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| and we're not, it's not that Larry and I are particularly offended at criticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| or don't expect criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| We've long known that goes with the territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| We've been through that on a number of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| What we're concerned about is that this dialogue be framed in frankly simplistic terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| What do you like, openness or closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Well, that's not much of a distinction once things are framed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| We think that's a very simple and inappropriate framing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| and we think that it's being framed that way has been destructive to the possibility of us working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| to approach a very difficult situation and serve as a model for how to bring everybody to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| to reach a good position and avoid the kind of thing we can see in Wisconsin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| or any number of states or all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| That isn't the kind of rhetoric the general public pitted against public employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| That is not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| So where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| What we'd like to suggest is, first of all, we'll admit to some miscalculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| We did not think that this would become embroiled in the political process, the electoral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| We also underestimated, and shame on us for this, shame on me anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| intense stakeholder interest in the nature of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| That's understandable, and we just didn't think that would be of so much concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| We didn't appropriately consider the concern for the nature of the deliberations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| as opposed to the ability to process and confront and frame issues for further public dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| That's what we've wanted to do, frame, get issues on the table, frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| so then there could be public dialogue, and there are about five points of public access to that dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| that would come subsequent to our group together putting out some options and alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| if, in fact, we got there, because we don't know where we were going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| We don't know what, if any, recommendations would emanate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| What we think is the best thing now, we think it's best, frankly, to step back at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| and let's sort of return to the traditional roles of the executive and legislative branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| which is we think the more traditional roles would inform the deliberations by Larry and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| representing the administration and others, preparing a set of alternatives and options with consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| not necessarily recommendations, though they're not foreclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| and that council take those as they would wish with this task force, if they wish, or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| And at that point, if council blesses that deliberative process, it is by definition open, as it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| because it's part of council's deliberative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| And we would like to suggest that we, I guess for lack of a better word, step back or pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| try to see whether we can get things prepared, hope that everybody can realize that the goal of this is reaching consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| on a very difficult issue of which we all, I think, have a common interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| And that's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| The common interest is the pension system has to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| It's got to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| So we commit to addressing this at the administrative level during the next number of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and preparing and forwarding possible alternative approaches to council for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Council's consideration can include submitting various approaches to the existing task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| or creating another task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| That's council's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| And then we think we've got a good solution to this, which is at that point the meetings are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| You can ask that they be, but they have to be legally at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| And that the administration would have done its homework in putting this out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| and given council something to deliberate and later place on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Because I'll back up with one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| The administration cannot place things ever on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It has to go through council to go to the pension board to go to the subsequent council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| So that recognizes, and I hope I didn't mean these remarks to be strident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| I hope I didn't come off that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| It's just that we wanted to make sure that you all, everybody in here, and you see I'm looking at the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| as much as I'm looking at council, if not more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Because everybody has a stake in this, especially those of you sitting in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And that we all reach the common goal of finding the best process to get where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2153)|
| 0:36:02| And that's, I think, the one that we've suggested at this point is the one we'd like to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| And we appreciate your taking the time and giving me the time to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| I think I exceeded my five minutes by a factor of I don't know how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| But I will turn it over to my colleague, Larry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Mr. Martin, you have comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| First of all, thank you, Mayor Brown, for the opportunity to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Brevity has never been one of my long suits, but I will be brief tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| First of all, I want to thank Dr. Lyons for stating well our position relative to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| And I want to underscore for everyone, the audience and council as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| that what he has shared with you verbally and what we have shared with you in a written document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| does indeed reflect our collective thoughts and position in regard to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| And the second point that I want to make is to underscore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| that the city, in our opinion, has a significant challenge with the sustainability of the pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| It is why Mayor Haslam issued a clarion call asking us to address it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| And as Bill pointed out, and I believe, we're not in a crisis today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| But it is not premature either for us to be about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| And for us, individually and collectively, to ignore the warning signs would be irresponsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2256)|
| 0:37:45| and our employees and the taxpayers would be left with the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| So all of us, I know, take this matter seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| We appreciate your consideration and listening to the position that Bill has stated well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And let me say that, as a mayor, it would be easy to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| But this is a situation in which I believe it's wise to act now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| We don't want to alarm everybody and get people so frustrated and upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| but I think it's a wise move to look at the pension system now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| Let me recognize, well, we have a couple of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Do we want to hear or are we going to hear from the folks first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Yes, we're going to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Before we deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Either way, we have more than three signed up, so we'll have to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2327)|
| 0:38:57| I'll make the motion to suspend the rules to let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| How many have we got signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| We have eight people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| I'll suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| What would be the pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Four or five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Four minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I'll make the motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Give each speaker three minutes to make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| And we'll be cognizant of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| Let's just say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Let's just go ahead and make it, you know, if it's three minutes or five minutes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| let's make it five minutes as we normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I'll make the motion to suspend the rules to hear the eight people for the five minutes allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Ms. Mitchell, if you would call the first person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| And we're going to ask each person if you would come down and give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| and you will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Mark Padgett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2415)|
| 0:40:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I'm Mark Padgett, 6502 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you for allowing me to come down here and speak with you all tonight on such an important issue to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| to city employees, and also city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Open meetings shouldn't be a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Knoxvillians deserve better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| And to me, it's a cut and dry issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| It's a necessity for our city to have these open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| I'm here tonight in support of the resolution to make all of the pension task force meetings open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| Sometimes with the best intentions, we miss the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| And I believe in this case what we have are some very dedicated public servants who are committed to offering solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| to the rising costs of pensions, but we've missed the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| With nearly $9 million in taxpayer money at stake and what we heard tonight may be rising to $30 million in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| public meetings will help and inspire confidence in the group's decision-making and trust with taxpayers and city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| I want to applaud Councilwoman Brenda Palmer for introducing this resolution aimed at improving transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| Knoxvillians should have the right to attend and observe all local government meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| especially when there's millions of taxpayer dollars at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| And I urge City Council to show our commitment to open processes as a city by voting for this critically important resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2509)|
| 0:41:58| I also want to applaud Dr. Lyons for his statement tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| and I believe the resolution or the idea of taking a step back is something that this is what we get when we have open discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| open and frank discussion that the people's will is seen and known and we can make a decision and step back and take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| And I thank you for that, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Mr. Padgett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Mr. Alvin Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| Mr. Harmon is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Alvin, you got the elective seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| You go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Let him go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Age before beauty, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Well, let me say it's an honor to be here tonight for the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| and I appreciate I.V. for his many years of service for the city and also for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| And retirement is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I just left the 28th of January and had a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| It seems like I'm working harder at politics than I was even at the City Council and also at the City Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| But I appreciate what each one of you are doing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Before you continue, I know everybody knows you, but give your address if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| I'm Ivan Harmon, 4100 Sullivan Road, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| But I do appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| I look at what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| I stood up there for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| And some days are good days and some days are bad days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| And I'd say this is probably one of your all's bad days maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Hope it ain't that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| But I come here tonight just to support the taxpayer and also the city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| I think they have a right to have an understanding of what's going to happen to their pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| if there is anything going to happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| The next mayor, whichever one of those candidates is going to win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| will have a tough decision to make along with the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| And I applaud Councilwoman Palmer for her efforts to bring it out to the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| And Bill Lines over here for what he did and Larry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| You all have done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| And also our Mayor Brown, I know you stepped in in a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| We've got a great governor that left here as mayor and went to Nashville as governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| And I appreciate what you're doing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| And I know you've done a hard job, you know, doing a great job at what you're doing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| And I just wanted the meeting to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| let the people understand what you're trying to do to them for them and work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And let's continue making this open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Mr. Hallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| And I'm here as the president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And before I start, I'd like to ask all the city employees, whether you're police, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| or general government, to stand who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| I had a speech, and Dr. Lines, you ruined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| So you're going to get what you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2714)|
| 0:45:25| There are approximately 3,700 city employees who participate one way or another in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2725)|
| 0:45:37| And since I've been here the past 31 years, we've seen pension debates, fights, arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2737)|
| 0:45:48| over and over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| I've had the privilege to work with Bill Warwick, who can cite their pension plan and sign it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| I've had the privilege to work with Brian Moran of KPD, Mark Taylor, and Kevin Faddis on pension issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| And every one of those issues have been done in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| For those of you who do not know, let me give you a little history of our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| We had one mayor who had a director who wanted to take it to build low-income houses on Wythe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| That same mayor wanted to take it to build a waterfront with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| Mayor Bill Haslam, excuse me, Governor Bill Haslam, had a special call city council meeting trying to give it away to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| And didn't you wonder why these people are suspect at a meeting, a task force that's going to be in closed sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2800)|
| 0:46:50| This is our livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| We're not here for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I've been here 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| There are other people who have been here longer than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| There are other people who just came here who intend to stay here their whole entire career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| And if you're not trying to hide something, don't do it behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| Now, the statement about that we can't be frank and open, what do you think we do every time we come here before you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2831)|
| 0:47:21| Not only is it on a matter of public record, it's on TV, live, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| We've been here to fight for pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| We've been here to fight for pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| We've been here to fight for health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| And with all due respect, Dr. Lyons, part of the Mercer plan task force couldn't be open until after the contract was awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| so that in order to follow purchasing procedures had to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| So you can have negotiations now before you award a bid public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| The part when the Mercer was chosen, that was one part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| but the vast majority of the discussions came after they were chosen to make the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I don't disagree with that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| All I'm saying is, and I appreciate the fact that you all have said that we're not at a crisis yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2892)|
| 0:48:22| but it's a funny thing to me that our outgoing mayor recommended that we form this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2902)|
| 0:48:33| which I have another issue with and we'll save that until a later date to make up this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| But it's a funny thing to me we get a recommendation from an outgoing mayor to form a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| and the very first thing he does when he gets to the state is start on that pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| And I reminded him before he left that I get that pension too, so I'm not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| But I want to urge you all to do whatever it is you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| These people deserve the right to know what's coming to their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Alva Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Let me say right now first, I'm no kin to Alvin Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Let's give him more time then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| My name's Alva Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I'm a retired farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| I live at 5632 Kentwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| I'm secretary of the Knoxville Retired Farmers Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| You've never heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| The reason you've never heard of it, we have never contacted anybody and asked for anything until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| I'm the voice of 44 retired pension F farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| You probably don't know there's two pension systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| There's a plan F and a plan C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Plan F has got 44 farmers in it, ages from 71 to 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| Our system ceases in 2029 because the youngest farmer would be 91 years old if he's alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3014)|
| 0:50:25| We ask for an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| If you're going to discuss our pension, which we've earned by our bodies, we should know what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| I also speak for the 240 retired farmers in plan F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Also in plan F, there is 43 retired policemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| The youngest retired policeman is 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| It's Rudy Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| The youngest retired fireman is Darryl Fry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| He is 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We ask you to please have an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Thank you, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| I'm the firefighter association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| I live at 1031 Josephi Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| I think Dr. Lyons, when he spoke, and I think everyone out here tonight, he didn't hit on a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| or I didn't hear it, and it's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| That word is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Perception is what's getting everything confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| I think Councilmember Woodhull touched on it, and I appreciate it in his opening prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| Gratitude and openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| So I'm glad you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| You helped me out in my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| It's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| You know, I'm going to veer off a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| We are not, well, from what I see and what I see going on, kind of looks like a bandwagon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| We are not Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| We are not New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| The public needs to know what we have to work with monetarily, what our employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| I think the newspaper put out that we can retire at 25 years, 50 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I could buy a million-dollar house if I want to, but can I really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| You know, it's perception out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| So I would think that openness, getting the public involved, getting the employees involved, it's the perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| You know, right now we are a little leery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| You can't blame us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| I mean, it's what makes the world go round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| But I hope that you all consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| I thank each one of you for being up there and serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Thank you, Mr. Fez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I'm the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Local Lodge 2 in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Our organization is also in favor of open meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| And we applaud the resolution put forward by Councilwoman Palmer and by Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3200)|
| 0:53:30| I think the way this was handled in the beginning, Dr. Lyons, has caused a lot of the problems that you're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| And I think I heard the word clarion call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And I know we have a very smart pension board over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| And I know I've heard from your lips that they've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| We've been through some tough economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Obviously, the pension has taken some hits, but it's recovering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| And I've heard numerous people that I trust financially say that those guys have done an excellent job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| And you kind of mentioned some stuff about the Mercer Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| The Mercer Task Force was a response to employees raising an issue from within that civil service brought up that we were underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3248)|
| 0:54:17| It took about two years by the time that came up and whatnot to get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| When the Mercer Committee was formed, the employee groups had input into, at least to say so, hey, we'd like to see you choose this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3265)|
| 0:54:35| With this, we got called in on Friday morning and told that this was going to be an article coming out on the paper about the pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3275)|
| 0:54:45| And so we had like the next day to tell our membership that, hey, this is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| We had no input into the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| And I'm not saying that you have to do that, but you wonder why folks are like, oh, taken back by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| So, you know, and the other thing you mentioned that's very important, and I think is what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| and this is what I would, whatever this body decides to do in the future on pensions, I would ask you to guard against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| is that the way it was handled, a lot of the employees that I have spoke with, that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| feel like it pits the employees, pits the public against the employees to a manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| This was brought out in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I read the article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| I read the editorial on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| My pension that I took into account when I hired on here and for the 13 years of service that I've given this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| was called a free lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And when I started the academy, I couldn't afford really to feed my family on the money that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| And I couldn't afford the pension thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| So when the pension and the health insurance, when I was finally eligible for those after three months in the police academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I went out and I worked at McDonald's in Dandridge after I got off and drove back to Dandridge to 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| And I didn't buy my wife a Christmas gift that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| We got the kids a little something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| It wasn't much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| They were little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| But for it to be called a free lunch is repulsive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| And when I look at the blogs and stuff that came about from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| and the comments that are coming out and the fear and the stuff that is feeding into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| and the comparisons to these other places where maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| employee groups have pushed too far or been too demanding, you know, and we're equated to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| the public doesn't know the difference in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| They just see what they read in the paper and it buys into their stereotype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| And that comes back on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| This job is hard enough without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Every officer, every fireman, every city employee that goes out there on these streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| or in this building and represents this city and works for this city has an enormous struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| And I know I personally feel, I can't speak for everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| but I feel kind of like the way it was handled, the public was played against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| So I applaud open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Let them find out how much I've been contributing for the last 13 years on a police officer's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Let them ask me how many hours of overtime I worked for years just trying to make the minimum bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| I'll be happy to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I think they'll be pleasantly surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| So open it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Thank you, Mr. Teller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3459)|

| 0:57:54| I'm a member of the board of the League of Women Voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| and I'm here to read a statement from our president, Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| The League of Women Voters urges the passage of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| We believe that open government is fundamental to our democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Conversations that involve taxpayer dollars or decisions by our elected officials should be held in the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| so that there can be no suspicion cast on any decisions that arise out of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3494)|

| 0:58:22| Again, the League urges the passage of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Ms. Dupes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Brian Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Brian Moran, 801 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| I am a city police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| March 20th will be 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Former president of the local FOP and the state FOP and a member of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| I wanted a point of clarification from Dr. Lyons before I get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| When you say take a step back, are you talking about not forming the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| and just making your recommendations to the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Is that the way I understood that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| We're talking about our not making recommendations, coming up with alternative scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| whatever it is that we come up with, and then having them put to the task force that council blesses, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| And that task force, as it deliberates everything at that point, would be open by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| We're just talking about placing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| We're doing some prior work to put things out to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| And I'm not sure that's going to solve our problems with the perception of what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| It seems to me, and no disrespect, I've worked with Larry Martin and Dr. Lyons and Bill Haslam and several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| And, you know, I don't have a problem with being frank, and I don't care who watches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| To say that you're going to now not have the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and put together some information to present to the mayor and council and then have the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| seems to me like you're just taking your toys and going home because you're getting some opposition on what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| I'm not sure that's the proper way to go about business, but I'll leave it to this body to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| If we're going to do this, we need to be open on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| and not be handed a stack of recommendations given to us by some administrative officials approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3611)|
| 1:00:20| That's completely backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| That is not at all what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Well, that's the way I understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Now, I'm going to address some things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Obviously, I'm in favor of this being open, the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I'm also in favor of the task force taking this from the jump and not the step back that you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| I, too, want to echo the fact that this was handled poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| I think I've had this discussion with Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| You know, it was brought up how this became divisive in our perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| And I supported Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| I supported him as governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| But when he drops this bombshell on us and the city employee representatives a day and a half before he leaves office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| we have to be suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| There's no other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I mean, you have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| And then the paper and the article printed one small paragraph about how the pension had a significantly huger return than 8% last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3673)|
| 1:01:24| but you don't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| So we're already behind the eight ball when it comes to public perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And playing on the fears of what's going on in Wisconsin and New York and New Jersey and Indiana, what they see on cable TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| we already contribute 6% to our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Our retirees are already paying $800 a month for family medical coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| I'm sure they're not in Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| These are the facts that the open meetings will put out to the public so that they don't just listen to what they hear on Fox News| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| and think we have it as good as they do in Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| I would also address the fact that in your statement, Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| you made a comment that most city administrations just make recommendations to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and it gets passed without city employee input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And you'll find those cities are tied up in legal battles for five, 10, 15 and 30 years over pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| We don't want that, and I'm sure you don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| I implore you, obviously, to make this in open meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| but I also need to caution, again, about what I think I heard about taking the step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| To not bring the employees in on the front end, as you did with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| even though it may have been handled poorly from the front end, is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| To come up with ideas and then include the employees is absolutely a wrong turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| And if it's because of the opposition to this closed meeting, then I would say you're doing it for the wrong reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| And I would also question anybody on this committee who has a fear of speaking publicly about an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| because there may be a camera or someone from the New Sentinel or someone from the public there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| then they need to be questioning whether or not they need to be on that committee to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| This is some serious stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| This is probably the single most serious thing we're going to address in my 16 years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| So emotions are going to run high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| But the facts need to prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| The only way the facts can come out is if there's an open meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and not just simply what people see on Fox News as it pertains to Wisconsin, the Northeast, and the West Coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| because we are not them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| We're paying a whole lot more than they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Thank you, Mr. Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| That's all of the speakers who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| And I think, Mr. Pavlis, you had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| That's a lot of good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Dr. Lyons, I want to thank you for the civics lesson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| and reminding us of how this can work, how it's supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| And I think that that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| So let me make sure that I understand which path we're going down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| The way I understand, if I understood you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| is that you all are backing off, you all the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| and that counsel, if they so chose, would be the body to oversee the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3858)|
| 1:04:32| the members of the makeup of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| And, Mr. Swanson, if I'm correct here, due to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| then obviously everything that would, any deliberation that would take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| because we oversee that, that all the deliberations would be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| and in the public and sunshine, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| If a task force were appointed for the purpose of advising city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| it would be subject to the provisions of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| It's also my understanding that you all would, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| would come to the body with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| and then the debates start from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I think possibly recommendations, but I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| and to talk to what I appreciate what Mr. Moran was getting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| possibly just a listing of the implications of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| if this is done, this would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| That is, that would be, and I hesitate to try to make my point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| I'm not advocating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| What I'm going to use is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I'm not talking about anybody's fear of speaking as an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| I'm talking about people not being forced into rigid positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| from which reaching agreement becomes impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| So basically what we're talking about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| what Larry and I would do is work to come up with a series of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| here's what would happen if the cost of living was put from here to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| Here's what would happen if the vesting went from, it went from 10 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| if it went back to 10, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Again, not advocating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| And putting some data out there, we could also make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| and may well make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| That is something that the executive branch might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| But that would just be something we saw for the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| and its oversight of the task force to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| okay, now this is your task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| You're advising us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| You're deliberate on this in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| And anything else you would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| We could step back from that first thing that we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| We easily could just say, wash our hands of it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| let task force and, oh, by the way, let me add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| we will, the administration will help staff that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| That is, we realize council does not have the staff support that we have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| So with, you see, Mr., you know, whether it be from the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| or from Mr. York and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| So that's what we see in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| But as, and I don't know if Larry wants to add to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| we're always, of course, as people in the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| on our own could well present our own set of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| We may have some from the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| There may be lots of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| but that we would be willing to provide a series of alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| and consequences and things that were researched that would help the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| not have to start at ground zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| though it could well do so if it wanted to make use of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| But at the end of the day, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| you will be bringing, if you so choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| and if the council wanted this to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| you could bring suggestions, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| You could bring it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| but the debate would lie open sunshine with the body that's being created now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4073)|
| 1:08:02| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I would concur with that, Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and I think your questions are right on mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| The executive branch could come forth with suggestions, alternatives, recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| that would go to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Obviously, council's debate is open debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| Council can then either directly pass that on to a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| It's really council's prerogative as to how they approach that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| and when they approach that relative to having a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| to consider the various suggestions and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| that might be coming forth from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| Likewise, council may have their own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Things that need to be considered by that task force or by the council itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| But things would arrive from that task force to the subsequent council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| and those deliberations on all that would be covered in the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| as the folks here understandably wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| But I think the major point, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| is that you all would make or not make recommendations only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| that would come either to this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| and we move them forward to the created body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| and then it starts from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Then the debate is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| The debate is on, and there's a very defined process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Councilman Pavlis, as to the route of those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| The pension board has a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Council has a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Nothing can go to referendum except through those bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| The administration does not have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| So I think that, I mean, obviously we, you know, this thing is already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4184)|
| 1:09:55| I want to make it like the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| You know, it's gotten off to a little bit of a rocky start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| and I think we've got the ability here tonight to get on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| And we've heard valid concerns, and I think from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| and I just have a little bit of a problem moving forward with this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| as it is because, you know, it's not a real deep line in the sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| but I think it's a line in the sand, just to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| And, Mr. Swanson, I want to ask again that if council, if we take this over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| in any deliberations, I mean, obviously we deliberate under the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| but if we take over that body, that everything that they deliberate over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| because they could give us recommendations, would have to be in the open in Sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| If a task force is created to advise city council with regard to possible positions to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4256)|
| 1:11:05| that task force would be covered by the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| So, based on that, I want to move forward with a substitute motion that we do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4270)|
| 1:11:23| And, Mr. Swanson, if you'll help me with the wording on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| So, in other words, I would like for this council to take over those duties of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| And not only that, but look at the makeup of the board in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| and then start the process, you know, from there, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| Well, number one, there's not an original motion on the floor yet, but be that as it may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| what you're suggesting is that the city council adopt the role of supervising a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| I think that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| And the appropriate way to do that is for city council to bring before this body a resolution that would accomplish that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4327)|
| 1:12:18| We don't have that before you tonight, and so you could not do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| But that would be the appropriate vehicle for city council creating a task force for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4342)|
| 1:12:33| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| The only thing you have before you tonight is this resolution urging the mayor's task force to do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| If that motion moves, if it was made, then would it be a proper substitute motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Really, if there's not going to be a mayor's task force, the issue becomes is there a reason for the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4372)|
| 1:13:04| if there's not going to be a mayor's task force to accomplish this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| And so it's really a question of do you pass the resolution or do you withdraw the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| or whatever you do with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| But with regard to this body creating a task force for the purpose of reviewing potential alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4398)|
| 1:13:26| to deal with the sustainability of the city pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| you need a separate resolution that would come before this body to create such a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| And I'm prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Let me go to Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Like all of you who came to speak tonight, there have been several points raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| One of them has to do with perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| and perception is something that we obviously have all heard is what we believe it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| I think from the initial conversations about issues with the pension plan in December of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| the last-minute notification to employee groups was not a good beginning for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| When I was a newly elected member of Council in December of 2009, I met with then-Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| and I asked him what he thought would be some major issues coming to Council and before the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| over the next four years and even over eight, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| And without hesitation, he said funding the pension over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| Well, I waited for the entire year of 2010 after that conversation for something to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4480)|
| 1:14:49| to look at the issue, to get the things on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Nothing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| But then at the end of the Mayor's term, this suddenly is something that we have to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| and I'm very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Then when it became an issue of a task force appointed with closed meetings, I became even more concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4502)|
| 1:15:10| I've had a number of e-mails and phone calls, face-to-face conversations with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| and it goes back to the term that Kevin Faddis mentioned, perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Now, I appreciate the administration making the decision that recommendations would need to go to a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| or something that was created, but not the one that has been named and identified with 13 or 14 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| Am I correct in that understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| No, nothing prevents it from being made up in similar ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| That's Council's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Okay, but I do understand and hear correctly that the administration is not going to have a task force that it creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Going a step further, when I introduced this resolution or came up with the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| I was really concerned about open meetings and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| We live in a time when people are suspicious about everything, whether it's their employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| their working companions or whatever, because we live in a society that seems to really address fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| and embrace it in a not very comfortable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| I have a concern, though, that this Council, this administration under Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| may well come forth with some ideas that a mayor the people are going to elect in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4594)|
| 1:16:42| might not want to pursue or might want to pursue in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| So, Councilman Pavlis, I respect your thoughts about a task force that Council might generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| but a bigger question is, is this something that we need to be dealing with now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| or do we need to give a newly elected mayor in November the opportunity to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| And I think that's something that this Council needs to wrestle with very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| I don't want to get into this too deep, but it strikes me that there is value to having the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4644)|
| 1:17:33| and the employees who regularly negotiate wages and benefits to address this first in some fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| and then the debate comes to this Council in open meetings where the concerns of taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| who bear the burden of any decision on wages and benefits has to be recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| along with the benefits that we provide employees to keep them working hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| and to be successful in their personal lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| And I think it is healthy to have some form of work effort by the administration working with employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4684)|
| 1:18:12| to bring something to this Council to start looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| I'm concerned with Mr. Pasolus' suggestion that we take charge of a subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| that we don't have staff to manage and to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I think we need to know if the parties that sit around a table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| and whether it's an open table as has been requested or some other type of table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| have come up with some suggestions and we're told what the implications are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| And we have to go back to our districts and to the people that pay the bills in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| and talk to them and find out what's reasonable and have an open debate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| So I'm recommending that however we do it, whether it's a simple list of suggestions and alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| or whether it's some form of executive and employee get-together where they work together to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4742)|
| 1:19:11| recommendations, that that happens first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| I think this Council is entitled to have the best views of the administration, whatever they might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| and we have to take that and either run with it or change it and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| But I think there's a benefit to employees and management sitting down and looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| I mean, we've seen the handwriting on the wall, and whether it came up in a proper way or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I guess we're not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| We are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| So 23 or 2,400 retired workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| We've got another 1,500 workers that are in the system but still working on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| And we have expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| And from what I have looked at, starting in 2005, we were spending about $3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| Last year we spent $7 or $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| We're going to $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| We're on an increasing path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Now, the economy may turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| It may make our asset management efforts by the pension board work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| It may solve some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| But it's wise that we not go down a path that increases a burden to taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| because it's as likely that in the future we may have to cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| We may have to cut staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| We may have to do different things if we can't solve this economic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| I think the healthy thing is for the administration and the employees to get together in some fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| And maybe you want to drop back and take a second look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| and bring your best ideas to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| And then I think it's going to be incumbent on us to roll up our sleeves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| and to debate it in public and to hear from the public and hear from the workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| hear from everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| But we have a fiscal responsibility to prudently manage this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| And I think we ought to start the process and not wait for another administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| or another year or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I think we need to be proactive and to tackle the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| I don't have an answer on the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| But I think the administration is in a position where it normally works with employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| to get agreements on wages, to get agreements on benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| And I think you should start with the laboring or recognizing that there is this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| that has the fiscal responsibility to the community to do something prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| So I think we should go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Maybe we need to drop back and take a look at how that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| and maybe the administration can do that working with the employee representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| But that's my perspective as I sit here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Dr. Lyons, I wanted to ask you a question, then I wanted to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| In your original design of your process, the options that you would create, the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| how would you determine whether an option or a recommendation was going to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| I mean, are we talking do you see that you would want to try to build consensus on your task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| before that would surface as a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| When we were discussing our working with the task force, and we do not think that's a good idea now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| we think that the way to handle it is what we've suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| No, but I'm saying originally when you were thinking through the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| We very much wanted to have an atmosphere where we could reach a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| and we know that was a tough challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| So whatever it is you were going to put forward was going to represent not just what you thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| but what the whole task force thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| You weren't just using them as a focus group so you could, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| Well, first off, I want to say that I really appreciate your very excellent statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| and I thought it was important to hear you go all the way back to the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| and describe your thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| I find this resolution challenging not because I disagree with what it puts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4977)|
| 1:23:05| I can't imagine anybody here would vote against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| but I find it challenging because it seems to suggest on some level that the original design was not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4988)|
| 1:23:17| And in what you and I know to be open processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| and when I talked to you and asked you about the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| you said there were going to be two open meetings in the front end, one open meeting at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| regular updates throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| And I hope everybody here, especially the sponsors of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| asked them to describe the process in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5017)|
| 1:23:45| The selection of your task force members included people who had very different points of view, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| So there was a kind of internally built-in kind of self-scrutiny going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| These task force members were not going to be sequestered into a hotel like a jury, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| So they were going to be able to give regular reports in whatever way they felt like they needed to articulate how things were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5042)|
| 1:24:11| But you know that when you have a conversation, I'm speaking to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5051)|
| 1:24:21| and whoever else would participate in this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| you know that there's one kind of conversation that happens when you're in a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| and another kind of conversation when you're talking one-on-one with another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| And when you're talking one-on-one with another person who thinks very differently than you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| then you can get some traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| It's very difficult to have that kind of traction achieved when you're in a large group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| and when there's all kinds of emotion going on, like what we feel tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| My understanding of what Bill Lyons, Dr. Lyons, was doing was to create an open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| but to try to tap into creative thinking and allow people who thought very differently in the same room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5096)|
| 1:25:05| to think creatively together about a very complex problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| That is an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| You are not stacking the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| I mean, I hope that in the long run, I hope that the mayor reconsiders this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| and I hope you all reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| I think even with the direction that we're heading in where, you know, all the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| apparently we've decided that they all are going to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| I do want people to understand that your intent was clearly to create an open, honest meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5139)|
| 1:25:48| that would generate serious outcomes, suggestions that were creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| because everybody's going to have to give a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| You want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| We were looking for some authenticity in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| We were not looking for people to feel that they had to take a very extreme position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| We never feared that people would be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| It's whether we would have an atmosphere conducive where people could relax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| and build a consensus and give and take, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| And that isn't, you may think that's a hopelessly naive notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| It works all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| We've both done it and we've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| And I know you're good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| So, you know, I would definitely vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I can't argue with this, but the fact that it even comes before me suggests that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| that the process was not a responsible process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And I also know that the mayor has been extremely mindful of the makeup of the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5201)|
| 1:26:50| and has expressed concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| So this resolution even on some level suggests that he's not being mindful of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| which I know he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| So it's kind of a funny thing to be looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| And I do want to thank you for your attempt at putting together really an outstanding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| We will not get the same kind of process if it's a council-sponsored task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| But anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| I'd like to second some of the comments that Councilman Woodhall made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| And I, too, when I read this, had a bit of a problem from the standpoint of where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5252)|
| 1:27:41| And I guess one of the things that I see is that tonight everyone pretty well opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| I think that we've definitely had an open discussion tonight from all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| And a question that I would have, and I'd like to throw it back to Dr. Lyons and to Mr. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| I would hate to see where we are right now in terms of a group of folks that have been put together for a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5278)|
| 1:28:08| I would hate to see a sort of end or even, as one of the gentlemen said, step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| And one of the questions I have is whether or not, Dr. Lyons and Mr. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| could we proceed with the way we were headed with the task force with the fact that all meetings would be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5298)|
| 1:28:28| and that the deliberations that we come up with would go to council for council's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| And, again, let us remember this is the mayor's task force, but that any information that we come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| again, making sure that all our meetings are open and that we then give our comments to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| The mayor then in turn, whether we call it a white paper report or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| he in turn will give it to the next mayor and the next council will have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| But during this whole process, we would be open, as the resolution talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| I'm greatly concerned, not only as a council person, but as a taxpayer in Knoxville in terms of where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| I've said on a number of occasions that I have expressed a concern about where our revenues are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| I think that it would be a terrible mistake if this council decided to say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| we'll just wait until the next council comes in and we'll just wait until the next mayor comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| I think that's really irresponsible on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| One of the things when I ran for council, I asked, I remember I went to, I had a conversation with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| and I asked him, I said, what are the real responsibilities of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| What is it that we have to do? I'd like to see a checklist so that I know what things I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| And it was kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| If you go back in the charter and he said, well, you know, really the only thing you have to do is approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| Well, that means we're fiscally responsible for what happens with this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| And I think it would be a mistake if we don't begin to look into the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| I think it would also be a mistake that with the task force that you've put together, the way that I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5403)|
| 1:30:13| it is the representatives of the different pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| I think that we're really fortunate to be able to have the volunteers that we have that are from the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| when we can tap that kind of a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| A couple of those gentlemen I've talked to and it's really pretty impressive in terms of what they know about pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| and pension plans and what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| So what I would hope or somehow, Mr. Mayor, somehow, I don't know if this is a resolution or what or a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| but if there's some way if Dr. Lyons and Mr. Martin, and again, I appreciate your comments and what you had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| and I also agree with Mr. Woodhall that I think your intentions were good and sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| and that there wasn't anything behind closed doors that you were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| And I appreciate that and I appreciate you coming forward with what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| But I think, Mr. Mayor, if they would be willing to go ahead and have the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| but with the condition that all meetings will be open, the press will be invited to all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| that maybe we could proceed with that so that we can move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| And I think all of us have heard the concerns of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| and I think both Dr. Lyons and Mr. Martin have certainly heard from the people in the audience tonight in terms of the feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| So my question to them would be whether or not we could proceed with your task force, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| with all the meetings being open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| So that's a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Council Member Grieve, first of all, we likewise appreciate the spirit of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| both at council and with the audience, employees and other interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| Clearly, as has been stated, and I don't want to belabor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| the makeup of the task force hopefully represented all of those interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| We went to great pain to do that, also trying to be mindful of the sheer size of the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| which created some angst among some people that not everybody got two members from each organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| those sort of things that we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| I would describe it, obviously it's been a topic of conversation of ours for lo these many days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5548)|
| 1:32:38| the whole month of March and February, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| We talked about it being a noble experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| We were encouraged that noble experiment could work and that the administration, employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5565)|
| 1:32:55| and people from the community could sit down and collectively talk about what we all recognize to be a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5575)|
| 1:33:05| We felt very strongly that that needed to be in an environment that had the best opportunity for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5585)|
| 1:33:13| We never dreamed that anyone would view it as stacking the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| We never dreamed anyone would view it as keeping it a secret, given the folks that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| And certainly people like Brian Moran and I have had spirited discussion over the years that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5603)|
| 1:33:31| I know him not to be bashful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| and I don't think it took him long to get an email out that he wouldn't be bullied or intimidated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| I think were the words, Brian, that you used, never that we would attempt such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5620)|
| 1:33:49| We regret that time got narrow, and we explained to the employee reps why we were informing them when we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5629)|
| 1:34:04| and what was going to happen, not an excuse but just fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| We were dealing with a governor-elect at the time who had a tough schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| and we were trying to coordinate all of that so that everybody was where they needed to be and we could communicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5654)|
| 1:34:22| Now, that's been made into looking as if we were trying to pull some fast one when actually it was just a matter of scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5662)|
| 1:34:31| Those things are unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| They create issues between groups that need the best opportunity to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5673)|
| 1:34:43| Our concern, and we would never want it to boil down to just what Dr. Lyons and I would do, we work at the pleasure of Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5683)|
| 1:34:53| and we respect that and understand that fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| It is our belief that the opportunity with the methodology that we had recommended has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| It has passed because of the discussion that has gone on over the last few weeks that has made it very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| to continue down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Does that mean that we abdicate our responsibilities or we'll ignore the issue that we view before this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And we will, as an administration, to pursue those and make recommendations to the mayor and to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| and the council can address those as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| It has to go through that process, the very public process that follows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| The administration has no authority to take those directly to a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| I think Council Member Palmer's point is a good point because what we were looking to do was to use this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5748)|
| 1:35:57| this year, to be able to study this fully, to make recommendations to who we worked for, which was the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5757)|
| 1:36:06| and for the mayor to pass it on to council and the new administration to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| We respect the concern about open meetings and everyone having their opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| We respect council's concern with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| And so our thought is that the best method going forward, the way to try to find the common ground today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| would be for council to direct how that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| how the public vetting of what would come to you as a combination of suggestions, alternatives, recommendations, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5793)|
| 1:36:42| because ultimately council has to deal with those and could use whatever methodology they viewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| The task force, which brings together a collection of people, we felt, obviously we felt from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| it was a good methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| When it's implemented is still important, and how it's utilized is still important, and I would think would be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5816)|
| 1:37:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Oh, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| I want to thank you, Mayor, and Dr. Lyons, and Larry Martin for working with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| putting together this task force to try to get everyone a seat at the table to start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| And I think, Mr. Faddis, you used the term perception, perceived, and I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| It's not what's intended, but how it's perceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| But I think one thing is clear, that no matter how we initiate this process or how we begin it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| whether it's through the traditional role with the administration coming back with proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| or through a task force where everyone had a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| that there's going to be plenty of dialogue and discussion when it comes to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| And when you talk about the next mayor, the next mayor will have a lot of influence on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| but it's going to come right to this legislative body for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| And there's going to be plenty of dialogue and discussion, and we've been through these similar things in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| so rest assured there will be much transparency and dialogue and discussion and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| And Ms. Pelos is in the audience, and if Bob Becker were here, and I know Marilyn and Chris have heard me say this a million times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| but I think our legacy with the Haslam Administration has been transparency and dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| and openness and discussion and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| And so there's no doubt that this is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| So I just want to say that however we initiate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| and I thought this was a well-intended, very well-designed process to get everybody involved and at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5921)|
| 1:38:50| However we do this, it's going to be hashed out over and over again, and we know it, those that have been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| So I just want to thank you, and I'm not sure whether I'll support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| I know what's the intention behind that, and I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| But no matter which way we go, I'm just here to say that we're going to have plenty of time to discuss it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5946)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| I want to, you know, I think I heard loud and clear the first time from Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| but Larry just confirmed they're not moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| The administration is not going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| The ball is in our court now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| And, you know, the reason, well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I mean, we have got to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| What's the purpose of waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| This is a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| I mean, this is a hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| The train has left the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| But what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| Well, you say the administration is not moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| We haven't heard from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| I'm getting ready to comment on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| No, these two gentlemen work for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| The process that I described earlier, and we can do it or not do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| but all I want to do is get people to the table, and it's going to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| and I think it's going to have to be open no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| But from what I'm hearing, that's where it's headed, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Mayor Brown is going to confirm or deny that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| On the resolution that's being brought before us tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| who can be against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| On paper, you can't be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| But I just really think that it's something that should be perhaps no motion or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6038)|
| 1:40:46| because I agree totally with what Councilman Woodhull said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| The intent was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Maybe the delivery wasn't or for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| but I don't, you know, maybe I'm naive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| but I don't think that there was malintent that there was something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| or something bad was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| And I think if we move forward with that, then that's kind of what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| It pits us versus them, and I just don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| I just don't think that it's going to be anything positive moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| So I'll just say that and hush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| I didn't mean to in any way put words in your mouth, Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| but I was just reacting to what I heard from Larry and Dr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| You did not put words in my mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| and let me thank everyone tonight from the audience and from the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| and from the staff of the mayor for some very thoughtful and intelligent comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| As I said earlier, it would be easy to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| It would be easy for me to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| But I want to see this task force go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| I'm going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| I'm not going to make a motion tonight, but I am going to have a resolution for our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| And I want to thank Dr. Lyons and Mr. Martin for all of their work and all that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6120)|
| 1:42:11| But we're going to go forward with the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| They may not be chairman or co-chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| They're going to be involved in it because the city is going to be involved in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| We have to have the employee organizations in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| We have a number of people who have volunteered and asked to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| And I think it's wise to go ahead and look at it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| I receive a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| I'm a working man myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| I want to thank all of the people who are here who work and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| I feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| But we are going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| It doesn't mean, first of all, let me say this, the task force will only make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| It does not have to be followed by anybody, by the incoming mayor or by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| But it's not going to hurt to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| We can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And I believe we can have that frank discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| Dr. Lyons spoke about having two open meetings, a couple of closed meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6200)|
| 1:43:29| and then an open meeting at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| But I'm not going to make a motion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I could, but I will have a resolution on the next agenda for the council to keep the task force intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6213)|
| 1:43:43| whether or not we have Dr. Lyons as the chair or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| But I hope that we can continue with this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| Now, that's my statement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| We have a resolution before us, but I don't think anybody has made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Mr. Mayor, I think it would be wise if we didn't pursue this resolution tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| until we see your proposal the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| That would be a good way to proceed, and then we'll know what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| Instead of trying to dictate a change or an aspect right now, let's just see what you come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| As you've now heard all these comments and can take them into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| I think that's a good comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| Is that your light, Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I can't see from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I would like to applaud Mayor Brown and my colleague, Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| in encouraging this body to move forward with a study of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Leaders are elected to make the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| Leaders are elected to come to the table with courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| and address the issues that are in front of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| And I think all of the stakeholders in this room share a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| that we want a pension system that's sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| And I think we share a concern that we have issues in front of us that need to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| And I don't think that postponing this for another year is productive or courageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| So I applaud you, Mayor Brown, in your leadership and my colleague, Mr. Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| in encouraging this body to continue forward with this in some format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| Let me ask Mr. Swanson, concerning this matter that we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6328)|
| 1:45:35| I could make a motion now concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| In terms of a task force, would that be something that we could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| The floor is open for a motion with regard to the resolution that's before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| With regard to the task force, we would probably need to have a separate resolution done before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6349)|
| 1:45:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Well, would you read the resolution again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| I guess it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Could I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| I applaud your decision to go ahead with the task force, a task force, some kind of a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6372)|
| 1:46:18| I think that that's a positive move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| My bringing this resolution tonight was not something that was short-sighted or ill-thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| or directed at any particular individual or group of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| It did bring issues onto the floor and into the arena of discussion that I think have been very healthy for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| And I think we all have a much better understanding of some of the issues and things that were not said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| but now they're pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| And so I applaud your proceeding with a task force of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| With that in mind, going along with what Councilman De La Voix said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| I'd like to hold off on this resolution waiting to hear what you come back with as far as the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| open meetings, closed meetings, whatever your pleasure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| And then we can address this at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| And, Mr. Swanson, you know how to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| Simply move to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| And I would move to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Let me recognize Councilman Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| One question, Mr. Swanson, and maybe I'm splitting hairs here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| but so in the order that it would be heard at the next meeting, I mean, which one would come first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6454)|
| 1:47:45| Well, we didn't talk about how long to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| But, frankly, it might be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| and I would suggest that you give some consideration to a postponement for four weeks for this particular measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| Take a look at what comes before the Council at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| and then make a determination as to whether you wish to continue with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| whether the matter has been solved already or whether you need to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| But certainly I think a delay of two weeks, two additional weeks in considering this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| I can't perceive that making a huge difference because you're going to have something very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| than what has been proposed up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| And I think it would be fair for all of you to have an opportunity to look at what's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| and sort of get a feel for how you want to react to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| So would it be proper to enter a substitute motion for a four-week postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| I don't think she ever made a motion, so we're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| She made a motion to postpone, but she didn't say for how long, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| I move to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| We don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| Did someone second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Councilman Grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Did someone second that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Now, Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| I guess this is a question to Mr. Swanson as well as to you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| If this is a mayor's task force that he wants to put together, can he not go ahead and do that by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6563)|
| 1:49:33| I mean, does he have to have a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Can he not go ahead and do that tonight if he so desires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| The mayor has the authority to create a task force that advises the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| I'm not sure the form of what he intends to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| And so I guess my answer to that would be it depends on exactly what he's also a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6587)|
| 1:49:57| So he may come up with a task force that is city council's task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| So I think it's perhaps premature for me to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| I can tell you, no, I'm not coming up with a city council task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| It would be the mayor's task force, but it's going to be with different leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| My question would be if, Mr. Mayor, he wanted to keep the task force that had been proposed by him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6619)|
| 1:50:27| he could make that motion to go ahead and proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| He doesn't need to ask for your permission, but there's nothing that would prohibit him from doing that if he chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| What I have in mind is the mayor has the authority to introduce a resolution to that effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| if that's how he chooses to proceed in the spirit of openness and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| I would rather do the resolution at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Devin E. has a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Arkansas Teen Challenge Women's Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| Inc., for one parcel of property located at 103 North Mary Street within the limits of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| pursuant to the homemaker's program for a contract sales price of $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Councilman Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I don't know if Becky Wade is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| I guess my only question on this, and it looks like a fine use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| is does this take effectively take this property off the tax rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| I mean, I understood the homemaker's program was to keep houses from going down in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| and failing and taking the neighborhood down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| And so we were making, normally making an opportunity for someone to come in and reestablish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| and repair a home and occupy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| And I guess normally that would be a taxable entity, but this is a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| Is this going to come off the tax rolls or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| They will pay property tax on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| So it's just the use is going to go through this organization rather than to an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| So I'll second the motion if it hasn't been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all forms necessary to accept a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| in the amount of $16,000 from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in order for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Management Agency to purchase equipment to enhance the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| capabilities of the Emergency Operations Center during a Department of Energy event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6771)|

| 1:54:34| Mr. Mayor, I understand that Mr. York has taken to his sickbed, and I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| say that I understood this having talked to him, that it is purely housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| We have ongoing contract commitments and whatnot that would otherwise have expired, and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| those monies are expended, they are placed in the proper budget category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| So we're literally just sort of cleaning up the balance sheet in a housekeeping sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| and I would support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| Councilmember Dellavope, that's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| It's a housekeeping measure that comes each year to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6910)|

| 1:56:07| Submission of this Ordinance to the Qualified Voters of the City of Knoxville for Approval, as Provided in Article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6967)|
| 1:56:14| Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, requested by Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| Let me call on Mr. Swanson to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| I just wanted to remind Council, as I think I've already mentioned to most of you already, if not all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| that when you have provisions that change the charter related to the pension, those issues are first required to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| considered by the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| And so if you wish to move forward with this issue, the appropriate motion would not be to approve on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7003)|
| 1:56:52| because the Pension Board has to have a look at it and have an opportunity to make comments on it before first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| So the appropriate motion would be to refer this to the Pension Board for their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| Yes, I subscribe to Council's comments. I wanted to add one other thought to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| I assume that we're in essence referring this to the Pension Board, and I would ask them on the fourth page of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| ordinance to have their council look at lines 10 through 21 on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7036)|
| 1:57:24| It starts with, In order to facilitate an ordinary transition, there is text in this ordinance we're replacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| The proposal is to replace the old section with a new one, and it will go to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| There's text in this thing that appears to be historically dated stuff about how transitions from different activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| happened in 1999 and 2001 and 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| If their council would simply give us reference dates for the various Board A and B and the council representatives on the election cycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| it would be simpler for both me as well as the public to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| You have to delve into a lot of history to see something that's now dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| So if they take a look at that while they're doing the referral and come up with some language that solves the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| makes a clear reference point to when people are elected and when they're replaced, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| If this is something that you would like to look at us, then we need to refer this to the Pension Board to study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| consider Councilman Delavaupe's suggestions, and then this would come back to us in whatever time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| Yes. Okay. So what do I need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| Move to refer it to the Pension Board for consideration. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| So my questions were to what was, well, I'll go ahead and if I'm out of order, I've got a feeling I'll get told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7127)|
| 1:59:01| Pass the gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| This 12B kind of had me scratching my head a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| You know, to me, the charter is somewhat the holy grail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| When we're going to do something with the charter, I mean, I think I should feel the earth move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| or I think there should be some groundswell of support for something that is of huge concern to my constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7161)|
| 1:59:30| and all our constituents throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| And I haven't felt this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| I mean, it kind of reminds me of the commercial the first time that Coach Shumpert ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| I'll never forget it as long as I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| He had this really cool commercial, had this big old Cadillac, and he had the tires stuck in the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7183)|
| 1:59:49| And it was just like they were just spinning and we weren't going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| So I just really, I don't know what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| If I'm not mistaken, this particular part of the charter has been in effect since 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7198)|
| 2:00:10| And for us to go put that burden on the pension board, I mean, I don't understand why we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7210)|
| 2:00:19| And something else, and I'll use myself as an example here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| You know, I was on council on this body for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| And I was off for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| But during those six years, you know, I served on the Knoxville Tourism Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| I was an MPC commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| I served on various boards and commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| And, you know, I wasn't a member of council, but I thought that I brought value to those boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| because I did have experience being an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| but just, you know, experience of living in this community and being part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| So to exclude people from service to boards, I mean, how many appointments, Vice Mayor, do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7251)|
| 2:01:00| I mean, gosh, there's dozens of them, you know, dozens of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| And then for us to single this one out perplexes me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| And so if it went to them and came back, you know, I've heard the story before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| well, all we're doing is, you know, we're going to let the people vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| Well, you know what, I think it's up to this body to bring good measures for the people to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| when we're going to affect the charter like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| And it's costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| It's very, I think, very difficult to understand reading this on a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| Generally people will read these maybe three or four sentences and then just vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| So I just don't really know why this is being brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| I don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| I think we should engage all members of our community and encourage them to serve on boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| A lot of people have expertise in finance and labor and law and, you know, a whole lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| So I would encourage people to be part of the process and not be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| This is not an exclusionary measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| It concerns one seat on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| And I did talk to Mike Cherry about the creation of that seat in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| And there have been different thoughts about the filling of that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| The reason that I brought this forward is not an aspersion on former Councilwoman Pelo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7343)|
| 2:02:30| who is filling that seat currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| but so that Council has a member of that board who serves as the eyes and ears of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7352)|
| 2:02:39| and comes back to make us aware of issues or concerns that come before the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| so that we do not have surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| So this was not or is not intended to be exclusionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| It's intended to help Council be very abreast of what's going on with the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| as matters come before us or as issues come before the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| since we are the stewards of the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| I think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Could you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Yes, the motion is to refer this ordinance to the pension board for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| I'd like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| I mean, I think that at any time, whether it be Councilwoman Pelo or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| we have the ability to call that person to any of our meetings and ask for a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| But just for it to say that it has to be a Council member, I just don't subscribe to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7415)|
| 2:03:42| And I don't, you know, I don't think that we should exclude, and this would exclude people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| It would limit it to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| If I understand it correctly, and, Mr. Swanson, if I'm wrong, correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| that this would limit this to a member of Council and exclude anyone outside of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| Ultimately, if this ordinance was adopted as it is currently set out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| it would provide that the city council representative to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| would have to be an actively serving member of the city council to be eligible for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| So, you know, I guess the question that I would want to ask my fellow colleagues is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| have your e-mail boxes, has your inbox been filled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| has your phone been rung off the wall for, you know, measures like this to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| to bog us down because we've got some real important issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| And I just think this is one where we're just spinning our wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Well, first of all, I want to thank Councilman Palmer for bringing this forward to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| And I'm not sure how the other Council members feel about this one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| but I do think that Councilman Pablos brings up a very good point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| By eliminating someone that the council may think has expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| and might provide us a good seat on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| However, I think that maybe there's a way that we could accommodate both sides of this story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| and that is by having that member, that pension board member, come to us more frequently with updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7517)|
| 2:05:26| because I think there has been some concern here recently that the council really wasn't made aware of the status of the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7526)|
| 2:05:34| and which way the pension was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| And so I know Mr. Cherry is here, and I was going to ask him if he knows the other pension board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| if he has that list with him, and if he might could just review any with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| Mr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| Do you have the list of other members so we can kind of get a feel for who else might be out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7551)|
| 2:06:00| Mr. Cherry, if you'll give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7560)|
| 2:06:07| Mike Cherry, Executive Director of the City of Knoxville's Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| I live at 238 Thurman Watson Road in Rutledge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| I think the question was the members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| There are four elected members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| One elected by the police department, one elected by the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| and then two board members that are elected by the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Greg Coker represents the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| Jack Banks represents the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| And then Jim Hudgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Let me ask you this, and I don't want to drag this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| but now who are they and what is their relationship to the fire department, to the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| Are they members of the departments and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| They are employees of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| And then the mayor serves on the pension board by virtue of their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| and the finance director serves on the board by virtue of their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| And then, of course, the position that's up for discussion here is the representative appointed by city council itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7634)|
| 2:07:22| So those are the seven members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Well, I'm not quite sure where I stand on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| and I do agree with Councilman Pavlis that it should be something pretty major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| and a major reason that we could justify sending something to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| and then to the public for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| So I'm going to hopefully hear some discussion and then maybe come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| I want to commend Councilwoman Palmer for taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| I don't know if the wording is perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| but it seems to me that the city council should have a member of its own choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| and whether that's someone who serves at their pleasure, whether or not they're an acting member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| I think the council ought to be the one that selects a person as their representative on a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| that's going to make decisions that affect a very substantial amount of assets as well as costs to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| And so I commend her for tackling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| And whether it's an actively serving member of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| or whether someone serves at the pleasure of council and can be reappointed or replaced or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| I think it's important that council's voice be effective for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| So I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| The second provision, there's only two pieces to this puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| has to do with making sure that the pension board have a majority of its members act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| and not just two or three folks who might show up on a given day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| that if there's some change in the pension that's an important activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| then it should reflect that that board acted with a sign of a full deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| and that a majority of the people who make up the body should act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| And if it doesn't have acting members at a particular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| they might have to postpone something until they have all of the spokespeople there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| But I think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| And this is, in my mind, this is housekeeping, but it's important housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| One, I think we need to have our own representative who's responsive to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| whether they're active council members or person selected from any walk of life, as Mr. Pavlis says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7769)|
| 2:09:36| but they serve at the pleasure and can be replaced at the pleasure of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| And, two, I think requiring an affirmative vote makes sure that we have the full body's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| when something comes up and hits the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| I think those are healthy amendments, however we phrase them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| And, of course, we're asking the pension body to take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| and maybe give us their spin on what they would do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| I think I will support this, send it to the pension board for their comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| and then I'll see what their comments are and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| But I do appreciate Councilman Pavlis, you know, raising the other side of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Well, the ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| I see Ms. Cash there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| I had signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Well, we'll recognize you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Well, I don't have a problem with your vote, but once again, I was involved in this amendment back in 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| I've been here too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| And I first want to preface what I say, that this is nothing to do with Councilwoman Pelo or any representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7849)|
| 2:10:59| But I want to remind you that every member on the pension committee, with the exception of the council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7859)|
| 2:11:09| and by the way, I did not know that it did not have to be a sitting member of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| I was under the impression that that was truly our intent back in 92,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| when the makeup of the board was amended to include that representative as well as the finance director as a sitting member as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7877)|
| 2:11:33| I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| But I do appreciate you sending this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| But no retiree or no current employee other than the person that you all concurrently appoint can serve on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7897)|
| 2:11:49| Every member on that board is a current employee, a current contributing member of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7909)|
| 2:11:56| It even says in the pension plan that once you sign up on the drop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| if you're on the board elected by your peers and you sign up on the drop plan, you come off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| and somebody new gets elected to take your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| So I just wanted to point that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| But I do appreciate you sending this on, and I'm sure that we'll be back before you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Thank you, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| And thank you for your excellent service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| 12C is an ordinance to amend Section 1-14 of the Code of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| respecting financial disclosures for candidates for elected offices of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| so as to clarify the financial disclosure requirements, make them consistent with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| and provide for online disclosure when made available by the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| Requested by Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| Before we vote on that, I know Mr. McKay, Greg McKay, was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| He wants to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| If you would identify yourself, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| My name is Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| I'm at Room 218 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| I haven't been here this late since the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| I do want to say one thing before we start, and that's the city should be proud of this disclosure that they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| It's the most open and transparent I've ever seen all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| You have to disclose, you currently have to disclose every single penny that you take in or spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| and that's a vast difference from the state and the way the state does it and the way the county does it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| So you should be commended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| What we had talked with several of you about, and Ms. Palmer took the lead on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| is just clarifying when this report is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| If you read it technically, it almost sounds as if everybody has a unique anniversary date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| There's two things that kick in you having to disclose monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| One is when you file a treasurer's report to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| The second is when you file your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| And if you read it, every two years we get this thing out and read it again, and I can't figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| It almost seems to say that everybody has a unique date based upon when they filed their petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| And I think the intention of it was to have it due the 15th or the first of the month or something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| have the same date for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| So it's always every two years it's a problem for us, and we would just like you to clarify the date that it's due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| While you're at it, you may as well go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| The state, I think, has a five or seven day requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| In other words, if the report is due on the 10th, let's say a ten day requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| if the report is due on the 10th, then it ends on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| The way it's written now, if you're bringing a report into the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| and someone hands you a check on the way down, you would really have to stop and amend your report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| because there's no cutoff date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| So we would encourage you, if you are going to open this up, to put in a cutoff date of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| So those are the two concerns that we had was it's not really clear when it's due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| and let's have a uniform time for every candidate and let's have a cutoff date of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| Thank you, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Councilman Della Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I just want to second that in motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| Anyone that's running for an office scratches their head and ends up in Greg's office saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| what does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| It reads like, you know, it's the anniversary date and it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| So it's good to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| And thank you, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| When we were all, the five of us who were newest to council were running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| there was a lot of confusion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| And I called and I got different answers each place I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| So I just filed a report hoping it was at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| And I think that when we were candidates before the Sunshine Law took over our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Councilman Pavlis and I had talked about this some and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| When you had a life, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Well, before we had a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| So the only intent of this is to just get everybody on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| and we all are looking at the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| And there's nothing new required here that you don't have to do if you're filing a report for the state or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8156)|
| 2:16:03| So it's not an extra step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| It's just a little, again, I like the term housekeeping that Councilman Delevaux uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| to get everybody on the same page and clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| I have a question for Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| And I just want to clarify that the way this language reads, once the monthly disclosures kick into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8179)|
| 2:16:28| then that disclosure will list all contributions and I guess all expenses all the way back to the beginning every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8188)|
| 2:16:36| So every report is cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Whereas in the past it feels like the report only showed the contributions that had been received in that particular month maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| But so anyway, you go all the way back, very first contribution is reported cumulative every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| Oh, I may have misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Your first report would go back from when you began, and then after that it would just be that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| I'm not sure that that's how it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| Let me get to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| Line 12 talks about expenditures, loans, obligations on the seventh day of each month thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| disclosing every previously undisclosed contribution, okay, as well as every, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8236)|
| 2:17:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| The first one that you file would go all the way back to the beginning and be cumulative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| and then the second month that you would file would just be what was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| We go back to the previous deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| I just want to make sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Chair, we entertain a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8264)|

| 2:17:46| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8271)|
| 2:17:52| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| I call the ease in ordinance to close a portion of King Street from Ash Avenue to southeast terminus of I-40 right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8274)|

| 2:18:15| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| We have the owner of the property who's been sitting through this whole council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| He doesn't really want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| And he may not want to talk, but if any of you get an opportunity to come down to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| and see what they've done to their building, I want to commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8312)|
| 2:18:37| It's another jewel that's in that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8317)|
| 2:18:41| And so would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| Can you come down to the microphone where we can hear you, if you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8327)|
| 2:18:53| A famous old judge said one time, son, you're already ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| If you speak, we might take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8338)|

| 2:20:49| and as it was pointed out in your literature, when this site line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| or when this property was first zoned, they did the site lines really by eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110308?start=8454)|
