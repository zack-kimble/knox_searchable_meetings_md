| 0:02:52| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=181)|

| 0:03:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Okay, we will move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Mayor's report, very briefly, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| I want to announce that our finance department has been recognized again for excellence in financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| The Government Finance Officers Association has presented the city a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting for the year ending June 30, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| Only one other city in Tennessee has received this recognition as many times as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| So thank you to Larry Martin and Jim York and all the folks in finance and administration that put in excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| I think it does say a lot about how we prepare and report our budget that we're literally up there in the stratosphere compared to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| And congratulations to both of you all and thank you for the great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| One other announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| We'll be observing the September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| This Saturday will be nine years since the tragic events of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| And the city and county will have a joint observance right here on the front lawn at 8.45 a.m. this Saturday, September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| I just want to tag on to yours, Mr. Mayor, that, first of all, I think that for all of us that attended Boomsday the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| it was a spectacular show and I think we owe a lot to the sports corporation and all the sponsors that participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| But the thing that I was most amazed about was that I think I want to give a special thanks to the police department, the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| and especially the folks that cleaned up after the party of 400,000 or so people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| It was amazing the next day to go down there and see how clean the waterfront was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| So I want to say thank you to all those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| I mean, it amazes me every year when we have a football game with 100,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| and then Boomsday with 400,000 that by Monday morning it looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| I'm glad you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| One is that there was a community meeting in northeast Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| And the concern was expressed by a number of people about problems created by absentee landlords in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| And I was going to suggest to my fellow council members that we might consider holding a workshop to discuss this in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=364)|
| 0:06:13| and if there are measures we should take or not take to look at our landlord tenant laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| and how we get our city cleaned up and help some of these inner city areas deal with issues that accumulate because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| The second point I wanted to mention, I may have forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Oh, I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| The MPC has been working for, I guess, some two years on the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| And it is something that has gone through a number of public meetings and has been vetted through the Internet site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| But comments have been made by some people that they're afraid Knoxvillians who live on hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| or ridges aren't watching and paying attention and this will happen before they know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| and maybe their property rights will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I mean, the gist of this MPC effort is to find and determine guidelines in a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| This is not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| It's not a zoning law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| But a plan that would look at some best practices for how we can either develop or protect, as the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| hillsides from damage, erosion, visual blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And I guess I'm going to invite the people of Knoxville who are listening or paying attention to go to the MPC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=446)|
| 0:07:35| It's knoxmpc.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| And right in the center of that opening page, you'll see hillside and ridgetop protection plan draft now available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| You can click on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| You can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| You can submit comments to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| I guess I'm suggesting speak now or forever hold your peace because this plan will be acted on in some form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| Revisions are being made and there's going to be at least one or two more meetings to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| But at some point, this is a final plan achieved with great effort and expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| And if you want to be heard, you need to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| And I just hope people do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| You always kind of wake up after the fact and say, where was I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| But it's been publicized, but maybe it hadn't quite reached people's consciousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| But if you're concerned about developing your hillside or what's happening in your community preserving your hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| take a look at this thing and provide your comments to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I've got a couple council items to go over with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| First, I want to remind everybody on council and all the folks at home about two scheduled workshops we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| Next Thursday, September 6th, 5 o'clock here will be a workshop on the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Thursday the 16th, a workshop on the KUB tree trimming report that will be issued that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=534)|
| 0:09:03| I will not be at that, and I think Ms. Palmer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I've asked her to sort of take a lead in planning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| That will be something that we think will be coming to council fairly far down the road after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| but the report will be issued that day and we'll be having a workshop at 5 o'clock on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| Two weeks after that, on September 30th, we'll be having a workshop on the tenure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| We had asked them several months ago to do a communication plan, and they're coming back with a report on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| and a report on some of the revisions they'd like to make to the tenure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| So that will be, again, in this room on September 30th at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| Right now we have requests in for three workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| I've asked Ms. Mitchell to get e-mails out tomorrow on two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| One of them was related to some of, well, actually, both of them were related to stuff Mr. DiLaVoppe talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| One is some concerns that was raised at a neighborhood meeting about vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| I had a conversation with Ms. Rojero and the community development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| The vacant properties task force is actually working on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| They were probably going to be asking for a workshop before the end of the year to go over some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| They're going to be suggesting the state legislature take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| So I want to get an e-mail out asking folks if we want to have that workshop and then to look at dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| That might be one sort of late November, early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| And then the slope and hillside task force report will, as I understand it, be going to MPC at their October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| so we should be picking it up in mid to late November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| So I want to see if folks want to do a workshop on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| We also have a request in from the black business contractors about looking some at our minority and small business hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=647)|
| 0:10:57| I'd like to actually have a conversation with Boyce Evans, who's working on that program, before I actually suggest anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| but wanted to give people a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Ms. Ferrati, you look like you want to respond directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| We talked about that at audit committee, that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Maybe you had left already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| So we had a discussion at audit committee to address that and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I actually heard some of that, and I want to follow up a little more with Boyce about whether there is value in talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| what we might do as well as talk to the black contractors and see what needs to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Council had delayed the zoning change for R4 into our next council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| and we'd sent it to the Neighborhood Advisory Committee for recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| They're making some phenomenal progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Look like they're actually going to be coming with a consensus regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| but they will not be able to meet until after our next meeting on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| So at that meeting, I think there's going to be a request for a four-week postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| and I wanted to give people an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| On the later side, this council has not yet had the joy of having a group picture taken, which we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| which is always exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| My understanding is at the next council meeting, not everybody will be present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| so I'm talking to the city photographer about getting a picture done at our October 5th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| So, please, anybody who can't be there, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| And I think that's all I'm going to say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Councilman Grieve said earlier about the Booms Day and the UT game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| and just really want to compliment the police department on the job they do with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| I decided this, that I was going to say something to compliment the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| but they really do such a great job in a safe and orderly fashion bringing the traffic in here and leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| and that's important because people feel like they can get in and out of here and come to events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| So, I just want to say they really got it down pat and have really mastered it, so I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| We'll make certain everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I appreciate you making time to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=788)|

| 0:14:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Mr. DelBofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Yes, I just want a correction on the actual resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| It says it's being decommissioned due to age, but the discussion in the information sheet shows it's really being decommissioned due to mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=873)|
| 0:14:41| So someone may have just copied another whereas clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| They might want to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| But that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=893)|

| 0:14:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with the Knox Housing Partnership, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| to provide $462,602 in Home Investment Partnerships Program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| to be used for the development of an affordable housing facility at 1405 Dutch Valley Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| conditional upon environmental review and clearance by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Mr. DelBofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Yes, Ms. Ferraro, if I could ask her a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| This 11C and 11D are really the same physical site and property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| and it looks to me that we're spending, what, $1,062,000 when you add these two figures together or thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| to purchase, tear down the existing poor condition unit, and then rebuild six units at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| And I guess I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| One is, it seems like that's going to end up being a fairly expensive project in terms of the dollars per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=952)|
| 0:16:02| and I know that some of that is construction costs and some of it's demolition costs, some of it's land costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| and you even have architects and everyone else, and I know Mr. Gray will be happy that architects are getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| But it looks like it comes out, if you take the gross price, we're going to have $177,000 a unit for each of the six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| Now, maybe that's unfair to compute it that way, but I was just wondering if we're getting enough bang for our buck on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| You can maybe tell us about getting rid of the blight and the value that has, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Certainly, there's a couple of issues at stake here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| First of all, you all know that we support the development of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| There are many people in this community that need that, people that work hard, pay their rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| or in the case of homeownership, they pay their mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| These are people that are working and need a good place to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| One of the complaints about housing, affordable housing, is that it's of poor quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| and a lot of people don't want it in their neighborhood because they say it devalues their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| Well, what we have here is a quality developer and quality affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| These are not just your minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| They're actually looking towards a better product that will, first of all, be highly energy efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| which is really the essence of affordable housing is to make sure that you also don't have a high energy bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| Because the carrying costs are really affordable at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| And so, also, they are looking at additional environmental standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| development standards in developing this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| much as we've seen some of the other homes and units that Knox Housing Partnership has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| We also have all of these homes will be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| We really, another one of our goals is to make sure that folks with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| or people like us who may not have, seemingly may not have physical disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| but as we age, we will have more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And so these units are visitable, and at least two of the units are fully accessible for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| So this is not your average poor quality affordable house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| This is actually a higher quality development that will add value to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| and will be durable and long lasting for the tenants that are in there and, you know, for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1107)|
| 0:18:36| for the nonprofit that will own these and rent them out for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Let me ask one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| If you read the contract, it seems like this money that's being invested is federal money with, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| a slight string the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It's treated as a loan until they can show that they've rented it out for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| and met the compliance terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| How would they ever repay the loan if it became a loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| It obviously is forgiven after 20 years, as I read the contract language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Also, let me just add one more thing about your first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| In addition, this is a higher quality, but this is also still comparable to other units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| If you want to get into the details, I'll call on my housing manager to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| But these are not, even though this is a higher quality, this is not way out there in expense in terms of comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| housing units that we fund that have the higher energy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Your second question about the loan, part of this is a 30-year payable loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| The other is a deferred payment loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And then there is a certain amount that's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So we have all three of that in there, outright grant, deferred payment loan, and a 30-year repayable loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| And that's how we, in fact, structure a lot of our affordable housing developments with our nonprofit developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| You know, any revenues that might come from this on down the road all gets plowed back into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| excess revenues gets plowed back into more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| So it gets evergreened and reused for making more housing and removing more blight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Yes, sir. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1218)|

| 0:20:48| Mr. Graver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| I just had a question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| As far as the developer of the project, was that publicly solicited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| This was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| These are one of our community housing developers, one of our CHODOs, and there is an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1261)|
| 0:21:11| They have to qualify every year in order to receive our home funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| When the NSP plan was approved, this was approved with Knox Housing Partnership as the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| We're not required to advertise or bid beyond that because this is targeted towards the CHODOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1287)|
| 0:21:37| of which there are three or four current ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| who all have access to these dollars if they have a viable project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1307)|

| 0:22:16| Mr. Zalvoppi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I just wanted to ask Mr. Lyons, I guess, will there be some subsequent notice to, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| businessmen in the Knoxville area as to the availability of this training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| And, obviously, it's a value going forward to be able to do this environmentally smart design work and construction work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| Yes, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| I guess Susanna Bassett here can address it further if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| But as much as the case with the solar hot water heaters, which we had some training on last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| through the Solar Cities Program, we make every effort to keep that information out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| and to remind folks that it's available and to make it ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1370)|

| 0:23:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Mr. Delbobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Yeah, this is a great, I guess, what, example of cooperation with the state when they did that bridge work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| on the Smart Fix 40 project and we're getting the parking spaces that will help the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| and northern part of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| My question, I guess, goes down to the fiscal information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| There's no cost to lease this from the State of Tennessee, and it's a 15-year lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| and there's a chance to reapply after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| There's a statement that I don't see any backup after that that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| any operating costs will come from parking fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| And could someone explain, you know, what we're anticipating and how we're, what is the parking fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Is there going to be charges as they enter there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Is there going to be free public parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Mr. Delbobby, we're glad to have these in front of you all first, have the leases with the state here where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| We can charge for operating and maintenance, but we cannot charge to make any money off of these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| So as we go into these, we're going to start as free lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| We're going to contract with PBA to manage these lots, which is very minimal management, twice a week clean up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| and see how it goes as free public lots and see what our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| We think our overall maintenance costs will be right at $15,000 to $16,000 a year at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Okay, so it's a fairly low number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Does that include the lights and utility stuff above, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| No, that does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| That's the clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| The lighting in the lot is a city expense, and right now that's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| run to the public service department budget because they need a meter to click it on about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| I'm not sure that's been changed since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Well, obviously, public safety is an issue, and so lighting is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and I was just curious what kind of dollar commitment we were making going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| But you think it's order of magnitude $16,000 for the clean up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| The lowest bid we have at this point in time, and you'll probably send them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| the PBA contractor in the next few council meetings is right at $16,000 for these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| If it turns out to be higher, do you have some ability to have a nominal charge of a dollar for a parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| The state allows us to charge our operating maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| We have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So you can monitor that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| The public generally expects and generally hopes that these would be free public lots to support businesses in the adjacent area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| But we need to make sure that, you know, we do it fiscally responsibly when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| It's great that you have this because it's going to help all those businesses in the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| I think, you know, survive and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| It's the hardest thing when you come downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| It used to be anyway, is where do you park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| And now we have some of these parking garages that are free at night, and we'll have these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| It's really getting a lot easier to use, and it's a fun place to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| And these are about 400 spaces in these two resolutions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| That's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1592)|

| 0:26:39| We do have the ability under the contract with TDOT to charge in the future if it's just to cover our operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1605)|

| 0:28:05| Will there be, as part of this contract of planting trees, which is a great thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| and I'm glad that Knoxville cares about having trees in public places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and increasing both the air quality and the beauty of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| will there be watering during the dry weathers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I mean, it's kind of sad when you ride down the road and you see some newly planted tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and it's kind of withering because it's a blistering hot summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| and I don't know whether we have the first year watering built into the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| whether we have city crews that are going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| but do we have some follow-up process to keep them alive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Actually, we have a one-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| So if the tree doesn't make it the first year, then the contractor has to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| The second question is, if there are public groups that want to get involved in planting trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| is that permissible under this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| or is that some separate program we might have to work on or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| In other words, if we have a community group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| or a neighborhood association that wants to help plant trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and maybe get more bang for the buck here in terms of getting trees put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| can that be done under this program or some other program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| This contract is not set up to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| This contract is actually bid to install the tree, provide and install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Do we have another program that does the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| The last paragraph of the background information says that the public service department works with the city tree board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| community neighborhood organizations, citizens and members of city council on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I'd like to be sure that KUV and TVA are also consulted so that we do not find trees that are small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1777)|
| 0:29:47| that become very large under power lines and then create a great deal of stress for a variety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| This comes from my seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| I see that former councilwoman Filo is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| We've heard a great deal about this, so it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| I think my question is really already answered by this last sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| what is the process that you're going to go by to decide where to plant many of the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Is there just working with these different groups and getting various suggestions as the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| And if you have input, we'd be glad to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| You've noticed a lot of trees downtown have suffered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and some of this will be used to replace trees that we've had to remove because they didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| But we're interested in input from council and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Will you be planting any more dogwood trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Well, I think you have to be careful where you plant a dogwood tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| because they don't survive well in all environments, but we do plant dogwoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| I guess just to follow up Mr. Brown and a few of the comments about working with the public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| on location of these, I know a couple of years ago my neighborhood worked extensively with the city on locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| They were great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| People all over the neighborhood got to know Mr. McCarter, the arborist, and figured out great locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| The department, I'll drag on them, they really want that kind of neighborhood involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| So if you all know our neighborhood associations at One Trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| have them give public service a call and start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| It's well worth it, and they're a great set of folks to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Waste Management Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| for the disposal of municipal solid waste and other waste at Chestnut Ridge Landfill for a period of 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| at a rate for solid waste of $20.09 per ton for the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and other specified rates for special waste at an approximate annual cost of $1,080,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| with the tonnage rate being adjusted for contract years two through seven based on the consumer price index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| and the tonnage rate remaining constant for the last three years of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Mr. Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Mr. King, I guess, would be the one to ask this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| As we move forward towards more recycling, do we have the ability to change our tonnage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| or our relationship under this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| In other words, are we positioned so that in this next 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| as we get more of these kind of one-stop recycling bins at homes and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| that we will work well under this contract or we have to address that at the time it comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| By this contract, we pay by the ton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| so if we decrease the amount of garbage that we have our contractor haul to Chestnut Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| then we pay less because of the tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| You don't have a minimum guarantee, the 50,000 tons as an estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| That answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment with Mays Bus Lines, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| to increase the annual contract price by $19,000 for a new contract price of $35,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| to accommodate the added number of trips due to an increase in the number of participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| in the various youth and senior citizens programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2015)|

| 0:33:38| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with E. Luke Green Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Inc., to provide all services necessary to demolish the building located at 638 Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Knoxville, Tennessee, for a total contract price of $164,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| I just want to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| I know this project has been on the books for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| There are some questions floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I just want to ask Mr. O'Hara just some general questions about clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| And first off is, you know, why are we tapping into federal funds for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| These funds are the Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds, the NSP funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| of which there are several things you're allowed to do with those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| These are some of the original stimulus funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| And demolition of vacant blighted properties is one of the eligible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| So when we submitted our plan to council a couple of years ago now, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| we had proposed actually $241,000 to be allowed for demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| And these are, you know, every year the city tears down buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| It's part of the public service budget, those that are condemned by the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| Sometimes there are major buildings such as this that we can't afford to do with just our regular city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| So with this stimulus money, we were able to set aside some for the bigger projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| that are desperately needed to come down, which we aren't normally able to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| So during the course of a year average, how many other buildings would we demolish, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| I believe I saw about 50 buildings a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| And then is there 50 houses, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Yeah, 50. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| And is there, you know, I've heard tell, I haven't been in the building myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| but is there a way to, if there's structures in there or something that can be salvaged, is there a process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| In fact, we've had, our law department has had conversations with the owner's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| And, first of all, he is salvaging some of his materials now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| And, in fact, if he chooses and goes ahead and demolishes the building before we actually give the notice to proceed to the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2160)|
| 0:36:11| then that means we won't have to, we can cancel the contract or reduce the amount of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| based on what he has already salvaged or removed himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| And so the money that we use to demolish this, is there a lien placed on the property, I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Whatever amount we end up spending on this, he has sent the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| And if he doesn't pay it, a lien gets placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| That's the normal procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| And, like I said, I've never been in the building, but, you know, I can remember growing up that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| if there was a building like this, I would certainly want to have gone in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And, obviously, there's a lot of inherent dangers to the young people and folks in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| So it's probably time for this to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| And, as you know, this building has been condemned for six and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| It is right across the railroad tracks from the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Kids hang out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We know we've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| They skateboard in there and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| So it's a bad situation that, fortunately, we have some funds to address it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Mr. Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| I was going to ask the fire chief if we could save some of this $164,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| and go out there and start a rip, snort, and fire and put it out and use it as a training place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Is rip, snorting a technical term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| It's a big wooden structure that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And it is close to the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Obviously, we wouldn't want to burn that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| But how about a nice controlled fire exercise at that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We'll be glad to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Well, it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I mean, it might be an opportunity to get training and removal at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Councilman, I would add that there are some environmental hazardous issues in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| so you may not want to burn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Well, it could be built as a marshmallow roast or something, and it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| It is a resolution respectfully requesting and directing the Metropolitan Planning Commission to study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| evaluate, and make recommendations to City Council as may be necessary to implement Ordinance No. 0116-2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| authorizing the keeping of domesticated chickens on the limited basis within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Requested by Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Yeah, I'd like to actually make an amendment to make some clarity on what we're doing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| Under Section 1, there we have the ordinance number, and there's that line after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| the affording particular care and attention to zoning classifications of high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I'm not sure what that means myself, and I'd hate to ask MPC to do that, something I'm not clear what I'm asking him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| So I'd actually like to change that to say allowing hens in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| So to delete the language there, just put something in that says, yes, we want them in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| So I'm going to make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Mr. Dunlop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Yes, I thought we already had this conversation last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| and you had asked that we have a resolution to address it so we didn't send MPC off on a wild goose chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| And the question was to ask MPC to be careful when we're looking at high density zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| and the planned zones and other residential zones that might have 5, 10, 15 houses per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| and that might be an improper place to have domesticated fowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| And so we were just saying, if you just do a blanket approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| you might actually have unintended consequences of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And so I'm not sure how the language was drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| but it was to raise that particular point that was raised at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| I guess just in response, when I read that, I wasn't clear that that's what it meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| So to my mind, affording particular care and attention seems like do we want them there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| and that feels like the question of whether they should be in higher density zones is one for this body to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| And I think, you know, just allowing them in all of them, you know, the yard setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| actually in thinking about how apartments work, how townhouses and condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| it doesn't work in most of them unless they have a pretty big backyard because of the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| So I'm willing to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I just wanted something that we're making that decision about where we want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| and not asking because I've seen way too often us ask MPC for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| and they come to us and us deciding we don't like it and just sending it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| So I'm sort of trying to get some clarity in what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| So you're saying wait until we send it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| What I'm saying is if we don't want them in higher density zones, we ought to be saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Well, then can I ask as a friendly amendment to your motion that instead of deleting the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| we put that they examine whether they should be included or excluded from high density zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| as part of their analysis that they're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I guess my response would be I don't know that asking them that question is where I'd want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| I think that's a decision we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| It's up to council if they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I wouldn't accept that one as a friendly amendment, but I understand the thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| I thought the planners gave us advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Isn't that something we'd want to have advice on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| I think we talked a lot about chickens, and partly I work the history of some of what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| is asking them advice and then not liking their advice and asking them for more advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| until they finally tell us what we want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| And so I'm actually very just concerned on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I don't care whether it's in high density or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| I just don't want them spending a lot of their limited resources on a question we ought to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2514)|
| 0:42:03| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| So could you go over your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| It's on Section 1 where it says Ordinance Number 0-116-2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| Everything after that would be deleted and be replaced by allowing hens in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| Just to say, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| And it's actually an easy change for MPC to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Apparently the prohibition on hens is in the R1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| and all the other zones say whatever is allowed, all the other residential zones say whatever is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| and R1 is allowed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| So it becomes a simple one to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2564)|
| 0:42:54| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I heard two no's from Della Volpe and Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| The amendment, not the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Were there more than the two no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| So Palmer, Grieve and Della Volpe were no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| The rest were aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| So the amendment passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| All those in favor of the motion as amended, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| The same three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I had the same three no's and the same six ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Motion as amended passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Article 4, Section 2.1.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| R1EN, Established Neighborhood District, to rename the R1EN, Established Neighborhood District, to EN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| providing minor amendments and creating new EN2 district regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Mr. Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Mr. Donaldson, I just wanted to thank you for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| I know that you've been working with the Westmoreland Drive community in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| but there are already a half dozen or so neighborhoods that have used that established neighborhood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| to kind of protect the character of some of these older neighborhoods, and it's really a useful tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| and I appreciate MPC's work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I understand that what we have previously zoned REN, I guess, will now be REN1 or 1EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2669)|
| 0:44:38| We're going to redesignate the first batch as Residential Established Neighborhoods 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| and the category REN2 will be, or however that's actually laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| will be for the Westmoreland Drive proposition that's coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| All those neighborhoods previously zoned to R1EN will be renamed to EN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| and then the Westmoreland Heights will be the first neighborhood to fall into the EN2 set of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| And I take it from the background material you provided to us that it's possible that some other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| might come in and want yet a third variation, and you've left room to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Expanding this to multiple columns was contemplated from the first that we started drafting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| so we were just waiting for that first neighborhood to want any deviations from the original regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| and Westmoreland Heights is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| I have a bizarre kind of amendment I'd like to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| This is a clarifying one that I talked to Mr. Donelson, who I hope he's still okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Page nine has the established neighborhood infill parcel development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| and if you notice on the first sentence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| these are the ones you use if you want to do something different from what's already proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| So I'd actually like to add the word alternative to the title of this so that anybody who is sort of casually looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| through this thinking about developing doesn't sort of get freaked out that they've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| My sense is that's not a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| It doesn't change much of anything legally, but it does clarify things a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| So I'm going to make a motion in the title under I to call it established neighborhood alternative infill parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| development standards, just so anybody who's looking over this doesn't start thinking how complicated this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| because there's actually all the standards that you can meet easily up ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| So that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| And the motion to amend is to add the word alternative between neighborhood and infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2816)|

| 0:47:56| Are you Mr. Fultz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Let's let him speak and then maybe he'll answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I'm Patrick Fultz, 1701 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| And I think maybe it would help if you had some questions to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| I'm really familiar with where you are and what you're doing there, what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| I have a concern that there is a house at the very back of your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| And am I correct that you're going to do some screening so that the parked vehicles are not as visible as they currently are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2904)|
| 0:48:35| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| We're getting an estimate on putting the slats in the fence that we put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| I'd like to also ask, and I'm not going to make this part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| but I'd like to also request that you think about some green type things too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| some hedge, some trees or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| so that there is more than just the fencing that separates what you're doing with the neighborhood and that turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| Because as you turn on Domingo Street to go on up to Westview School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| it would be more attractive if we had some green type landscaping in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| If we do that, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| But if we do that, can we just let that be the barrier that will blind that fence to where you won't see it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Mr. Donaldson, you're the expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Quite often we do condition zonings with a landscape type screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| We've gotten to the point where we have three types that we typically recommend, a type A, a type B, a type C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| In this case, a type A might be appropriate even in lieu of a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| It's a heavy landscaping buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Is that something you would be willing to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| I don't know what a type A is, but, yes, we would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| Perhaps you two could work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Yeah, we could make it available to you before the second reading and see what you're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3008)|

| 0:50:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Mr. Becker, I'm going to do something that I don't think I've ever done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I'm going to make a motion to approve this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| This is one I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Shocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| This is one the owner on this, I think, was moving forward with the purchase, had a deadline on financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3047)|
| 0:50:57| and then discovered that his property wasn't zoned in any form that allowed him to buy a house and move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| And he's up against a deadline in about a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| And this is zoning it for what it's been for as long as anybody can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| So I'd like to do this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| That was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3074)|

| 0:51:18| Mayor, I'd like to request a sobriety check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| That or a temperature check in Hades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3088)|

| 0:51:33| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Excuse me, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Mr. Becker, I have not heard from anybody in the community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Has there been any opposition to this, any concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I mean, it is housing and it has always been housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| This is one of those, as, frankly, every rezoning we have tonight, places where neighborhoods rezoned industrial 40, 50 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| and have never, yeah, and this is in effect fixing it to be what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| So, yeah, there's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100907?start=3117)|
