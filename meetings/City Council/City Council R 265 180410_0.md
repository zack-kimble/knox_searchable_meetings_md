| 0:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| I'm going to do it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=200)|

| 0:03:44| and we're very happy to have you here, Eve, Deputy Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| I want to thank you and Chief Roush and the whole department for the KPD Officer and Employee of the Year Awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| the lunch we had earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Several Council members were there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| It was a great opportunity to recognize men and women who make a huge difference in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| often putting their own lives on the line for our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| So we want to congratulate everyone at the lunch, and like I always do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| I'd like to also recognize all the families who make it possible to provide them the support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| let them come and do their job every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=260)|

| 0:04:29| But again, welcome, Eve, to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| I want to invite everybody to the annual State of the City Address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| where I will present my proposed budget for 2018-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| This year's address will be at noon on Friday, April 27th, at Mary Costa Plaza, next to the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=282)|

| 0:05:21| Again, that's Friday, April 27th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| The State of the City Address is a chance every year to step back and look at the big picture of everything happening in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| our priorities, our challenges and opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| and to talk about how all that shapes our proposed spending for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| So I look forward to seeing everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| This Thursday, April 12th at 3 p.m., we'll have a ribbon-cutting for our newly rechristened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| I can't say that word, World's Fair Exhibition Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| This is the former convention and exhibition center on the World's Fair Park below the Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| As you all know, Council approved about $2.1 million in this year's budget for renovations there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| including the new HVAC unit, roof repairs and upgrades to the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| Our partners at SMG and Visit Knoxville are already booking the space for a whole range of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| particularly sports activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| So I invite everyone to come on down Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Again, this Thursday, April 12th at 3 p.m., as we cut the ribbon on the new World's Fair Exhibition Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=381)|
| 0:06:31| Also this Saturday, April 14th, continues the spring festival season with the Knoxville Opera's 17th annual Rossini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| The celebration of music, culture, and food will run from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Gay Street from Summit Hill to Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=400)|

| 0:06:53| You can find more information online at KnoxvilleOpera.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| That's the end of my report. Are there any Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| All kinds of reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| I just wanted to make sure that everyone on Council and everyone in the audience is paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| This is budget season for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| and although City Council obviously does not have purview over the school district, that's a county function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| We are all county taxpayers, and the success of the schools that are within the city, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| certainly affect the success of our neighborhoods and the future of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So there will be, for those who were here last night, this room was packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| There were probably, I think the capacity of this room is about 450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| There were another couple hundred people outside from our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| who were very interested in what's happening with the school's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| and lots of public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| I started my morning here at 1230 this morning and at the end of my day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| I think these seats are still warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Yeah, I think so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| So certainly an outpouring of interest in what's happening in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| The school board will vote on a budget to recommend to the county tomorrow evening at 5 p.m. in this room as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=487)|
| 0:08:17| So I invite all of you to stay informed and stay up on what's going on with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I just wanted to say a brief thanks but a real heartfelt thanks to all of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| who attended the workshop on homelessness last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and for the providers who really did provide us an incredible amount of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| It was like, as I said, drinking from a fire hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| Two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| It was time well spent, and I hope we all benefited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| But thank you all so much for coming, and thank you, Mayor, for being a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| I would just like to invite everybody out on Monday, April 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| to meet and greet at Shoney's on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| I will be there, and so will Randy Smith, county commissioner from District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| I hope you guys can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| And Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I just wanted to recognize that we've got a group from Kingston, Pike, Sequoia Hills here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Ed Nichols, Dennis Owen, and Sandy Gillespie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you for coming to a city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| This is, after all, your meeting, so thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| The only other thing I wanted to add, Mayor, was that the county is having elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| and early voting starts tomorrow, and it runs through the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| so it's kind of a hangover from my old stint as a Knox County Election Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| that I feel like I need to announce when early voting is starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| So I didn't want to break the trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=594)|

| 0:11:53| pursuant to the existing operating contract, contract number C-05-0300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I want to have Jim York come up and talk about, and really it's a combination of C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| On item D, we're talking about borrowing the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and I just kind of want to know what the plans are for this $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| and how we're going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| So Jim and I have talked a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Some of my questions to him, and I would like for him to discuss tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| is we're borrowing the money for $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Couldn't we pay cash for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Just talk about what our options are and how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I think I should just address the first piece, and that is the contract with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| At this point, we're still putting the budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| The specific funding source for the Coliseum Auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| that's still to be determined as we work through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| So that is not part of this debt issue, or the debt which is on the next item on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| But do you anticipate that we'll borrow the $10 million to do the improvements at the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Again, we're still working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| It may well be part of a future bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| But again, we're still trying to make some determinations on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| Even if I did know, I wouldn't presume to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| because that's the mayor's prerogative at the State of the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| But at this point, I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| I just think it's kind of relevant to item D and that we're borrowing money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| Is it feasible that we could pay that out of fund balance and not have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| because the return is pretty guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| I think some of the initial costs have already come in less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| There's been talk about paying it off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| And then you're subject to penalties if you pay it off early and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Two of them to me are how are we going to pay the $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| And then if we're going to borrow the $17 million and why it can't be cashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Maybe I should try and bifurcate these two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| Again, what you have next on your agenda is initial resolution to borrow up to $17.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| That is primarily for the purpose of replacing the streetlights with LED lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=885)|
| 0:14:55| And on that one, the question has come up as to whether it is more appropriate to borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| or to pay for that out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| And I speak as this as somebody who does not like to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| But when we look at the entire picture, we have to evaluate a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| One of those is the desire of the rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| If you take a look at how the rating agencies take a look at cities' debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| or cities' funding or cities' financials, they prefer or they give you more value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| or more points basically for borrowing rather than to draw down your reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Again, it's always a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| But in this case, we think that it is more appropriate to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| In the case of street lighting, what you have is you have savings that will be captured over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| By borrowing, instead of paying up the entire amount up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| you can basically mirror the savings against the debt payments that you will be making over the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| That seems like a very financially wise decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| Again, because what you do is you're basically capturing your savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| and you're paying off the debt at the same time that you're capturing the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| Whereas if you basically paid up front, you're going to pay that out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| You're going to basically draw down all those reserves and it's going to take you 10 years to recapture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Another piece is that a lot of the funding or a lot of the payment for street lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| is coming out of gas tax proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Those are restricted proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| They can only be spent on certain functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Again, if we were to draw down, we would be drawing out of the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| which is the most flexible amount of funding that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Again, our cardinal rule is always draw down restricted revenues before you draw down flexible revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| It just makes sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Again, because we will be paying at least a portion of the debt from State Street A money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| it is better to basically borrow that money and then use those State Street A or gas tax monies to repay that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| Again, that's the next item on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| That's all right. He asked about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I think the two are really connected in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| If we paid cash out of our fund balance for the street lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| then we would pretty much guarantee ourselves that we'd have to borrow the money for the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| I think that's a reasonable assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| But again, we're still putting together the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| We've got a lot of things that we're having to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We're going to be looking at, obviously, borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| and we're going to be looking at potential uses of fund balance as part of that budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Well, you have a healthy fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| There is a certain level where it gets to where it's helped you all it's going to help you with your bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| I think the Coliseum could, on a renovation project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| could easily increase by 20 or 30 percent or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And any time you get into a renovation and you start peeling the layers back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| you're going to run into extra costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| I just think it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| And we may learn more at the budget address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| And so there's a lot that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| But I think the two pieces fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And I think we need to have a discussion about how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| And we appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| But we need to move forward on this on the streetlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| But in a few weeks, you'll see the bigger picture as we talk about the full range of capital projects that we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1126)|
| 0:18:55| that we propose to you to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| But what we are confident on is that what we would present to you a few weeks from now is that this 17.5 go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| and it be borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And there are other projects that we'll use our general fund dollars for and some of our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| Will we have your plan before we vote on this the second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| Will we know what those capital improvements are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| What do you mean the second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| This is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Yes, it's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| You'll know my plan at noon on April 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| I mean, this is part of the plan, you know, to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| We've said all along, basically, that we would borrow the money for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| It makes sense to borrow for this as opposed to some of the other projects that we'll be proposing where we reduce capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| We've also added on the Coliseum right on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Right, but that's part of our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| That's part of the big plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| It's just kind of the timing on how this hits us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Now, what you will see is, again, this is the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| On the debt, and I'm speaking on the debt, this starts the clock running prior to any borrowing that we undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| You will note that this was part of the budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| We also did a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| We haven't borrowed as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| We probably will not borrow until, you know, sometime in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| And we may not close until July or August on the debt itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| But what we've done is we, even if we have future borrowings, we will not borrow until we actually need the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1241)|
| 0:20:51| And that's always been our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| There were at least four of you last year we did what we call a resolution of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| which allows us to go ahead and use our fund balance to pay for any expenses incurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| and then repay ourselves from future bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| That's a kind of standard, you know, activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| We will probably do the same if we have any future borrowings because, again, you don't want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Once you borrow, you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Once you close, you start, you know, having to pay interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And we don't want to pay interest until we absolutely have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So, again, that's all part of this process, all part of the timing and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| So, again, you know, it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We budgeted this last April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| It was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| And we're not going to borrow until, again, June and maybe not close until July, like I say, or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| So we've been doing that all along with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| This just starts, the next piece starts the clock, which allows us to go ahead and do that borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1321)|

| 0:23:07| Ordinance is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| 12A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2, Section 4-69 of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| City Code relative to beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| I'd actually like to have some discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| When I first read over this, it really disturbed me, but I'd like to talk about this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1398)|
| 0:23:30| that before was the exception to the rule, and now it's just in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| About underage people being in the building at certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Proprietor Sam Natour is here, and he'd come up, and we can ask him and talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Sir, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Sam Natour, co-owner of Port Tappan, Knoxville, 207 West Jackson Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| I was just concerned this is not a rule that's just for your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| This is what is throughout Knoxville, and your establishment was left out of this rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| and now it's being included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Any other questions, concerns, or suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| I sent the proposal to a number of you, so I'm in here to take any questions or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| as well as Chief Roche of the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| If there's any suggestion on how we can enforce this rule better, or perhaps any suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| that we can do to make sure of compliance, I'm all ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Yes, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Were you finished, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Yeah, and I just wanted to address your question, just for the council members that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| When POR came along, they were a self-serve establishment, and we created this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| and there was obviously some concern because it was, I think, the first self-serve establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| in the city, and so there were some special rules made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| But essentially, all this does is allow, I mean, in any other place, you know, restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| you can go into, and people underage are allowed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| They just can't consume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| And what this does is allow that for POR up until 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| And I talked with Mr. Natour, and they've got parents with strollers in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| the day that can't come in, you know, because they have a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| So, situations like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| But if it's after 7 p.m., then it still will be 21 and up for the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| So, they're still under stricter rules than most of the other establishments in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| The idea of parents with strollers does not make me feel any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| First off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| And then I also had concerns because there was this wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| But my understanding is there are wristbands for, if you are paying for however many ounces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| that's in the wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Yes, the wristband is RFID or radio frequency activated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| So, it's tied to that person's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| It cannot work without being activated first by a staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| So, with a minor, as we propose, it would be a simple paper wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| No official POR tap and wristband will be issued to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Therefore, they cannot access the taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| And Mr. Frost wanted to add some context to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Briefly, for the five people who weren't around when this started as a bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| What POR was wanting to do was not allowed under the city ordinances at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| And Allison Dyer of the law department and I met with the people from POR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| numerous conversations with Chief Roush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| and I talked to people in different states, different governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| that had these self-served beer establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| So, what we came up with was, in my opinion, a very restrictive ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| that would allow POR to do the type of business that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| They have, as far as I can think of off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| they're probably the only place in town that has very specific staffing guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| depending on the number of the members of the public in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| And it's been going well as far as everything I've discussed with Chief Roush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| ever since they've opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| And they started calling after a period of time saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| we're having moms and dads coming and wanting to bring their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| and the kids aren't allowed because it was 21 and up only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| So, we discussed it with Chief Roush, we discussed it with the people at POR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| and we came up with this modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| It doesn't change the staffing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| It makes people who are under the age of 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| that might appear to be close to being of age to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| or in a different type of wristband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| they still have to have the staffing requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| even though some people in there aren't eligible or aren't of age to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| It's still very restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| And POR people, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| they've been a model business to work with in coming up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| to have them come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1720)|

| 0:29:23| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I just wanted to see if there's any questions for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| I went out and looked at the site with Mr. Graham and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| this area is predominantly surrounded by C3 and C4 zones right in the angle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| between Merchants and Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| so to me it seems like an appropriate place for Mr. Graham's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and I know he's here to answer any questions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Well, Mr. Seymour, I think, is here to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Well, was your motion C3 or C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| He's requesting C4, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Well, this says C3 on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| It says C3, and that was what my second was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Your motion is to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Well, okay, well, you all didn't apply correctly then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, we did apply for C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| All right, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| The applicant applied for C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Okay, and I have a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| MPC approved C3, so you're making the motion to approve C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| So before us it says C3, so I need a motion to amend 12C to approving the C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| Correct, I'll make that motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| There's a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Okay, any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| This is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Well, first, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I think I've got a couple questions for MPC, and I think is Deputy Director Kelly here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Has there been a trend in the either increase or decrease in use or level of use in the property surrounding this particular parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1861)|
| 0:31:14| The property in question, the property that is zoned SC1 presently is vacant property and has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| and I don't know that it's ever been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| The shopping center, adjoining shopping center, has been undergoing significant changes over the past number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| Clinton Highway itself has seen a significant number of turnover throughout the years in that area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| The surrounding properties, though, have they been trending up or down in the level of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| or are they basically staying the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| With regard to the zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| The zoning district per se, no, they have more or less stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| There was a change in order to accommodate the Joe Newbert body shop some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| and that's the C4 property that is adjoining this is that body shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| It was approved with conditions, and I'm sorry to say I don't know what the specific conditions were when it was approved, C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Are there any residential areas nearby this that need to be buffered from a C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| No, this used to be a strong residential area years and years and years ago, probably in the 60s and 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1948)|
| 0:32:37| and has since been changed over to practically all commercial now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| I think where the shopping center was at one time was an old drive-in TA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1963)|
| 0:32:52| I think that's all I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Either Mr. Graham or Mr. Seymour, I have maybe a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| I know that in the tour that Mr. Graham took me on, the same as Councilman Campin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| right next to this property is a Dunkin' Donuts and a parcel that has already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| How much investment are we thinking was put into that property, which really is right next to this parcel you're talking about today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| That was done by Mr. Graham, so he can, $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| He just completed that last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| So I would imagine that putting a used car lot or something like that back there might not be helpful to your $2 million investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| He is not going to do anything that will hurt that recent investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Well, I appreciate it, and I would support moving to C4 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| I think this is a commercial area where there's no residential buffer that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| The area certainly could use a spark of private investment, which might then go forward and start spreading out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| So I certainly approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things and ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| So in regards to the conditions that are on the Newbert property from watching the NPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| NPC staff said that it was to limit outdoor storage because of the collision in terms of passing it up to a C4 for outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| So that's what the condition was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| I supported being C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I didn't see a whole lot of issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I think it's an appropriate use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| I've been to a lot of properties that have been developed with four-ish story hotels with maybe a Krispy Kreme or a Dunkin' Donuts in front or a Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2080)|
| 0:34:51| And I think those work well together so that if you're at the hotel, you can walk next door and use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| One of the questions that did come up in NPC that I didn't quite get the answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and I can't remember when I met with Mr. Graham if it was answered, was access to merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| I know there's the drive there that connects to merchant and Kermit connects to merchant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| but the parcels, plural, with Dunkin' Donuts and the other building pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| will there be connectivity from the potential hotel site to merchants through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| So that was one of the, I mean, if you want to elaborate on that, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Is it going to be a drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Is it sharing those drives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Are there going to be contiguous parking lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| They'll probably remain separate partials, but, yes, there'll be some sort of cross-easement completed once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| I'm sorry, Tim Graham, Graham Corporation, 2300 Oak Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| But, yes, until we land the actual tenants and know the building footprints and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| The plan I showed you does show some connectivity, which provides good access to both properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| from both Kermit and merchant trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I just, there is no residential there to conflict with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and it is a reasonable thing in an area that's had disinvestment where the Kmart left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| We've had grocery stores and out parcels there at that Kmart shop and center leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| and so that's a reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| And the comforting thing from things that were brought up at MPC was that to turn it into storage units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| long-term storage, whatever, is that it does require a use-on-review, because I think we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| I'm not trying to say I'm anti-storage, it's just that, that is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Correct, and I think it has to be climate-controlled enclosed storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| But it will still require a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| A use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| A C4 doesn't give it a blanket ability to be a storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| because I don't think that that's the best use, though that's not necessarily our call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| I think that that discussion could happen with the public if that's the route that it went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| even though that is not Mr. Graham's desired outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| This is a little confusing, since MPC voted on this, and they voted 6-8 to decline the C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2235)|
| 0:37:26| and then voted 9-5, and I'm not real clear as to why they did either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| So I don't know if Dan can explain this to me, Mr. Kelly can explain this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| I will explain what's in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| The assumption is, since we, the staff, recommended C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| they adopted our thought process in approving the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| The C4 zone, by virtue of its very name, is highway and arterial commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| It is primarily intended to be located along the major streets of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| The uses that you normally find in the C4 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| in addition to what's permitted in C3, are the outdoor sales type activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| such as car lots, mobile home sales, landscape sales equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| anything that really requires quite a bit of outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| The Planning Commission, looking at the property, felt that this is more or less internal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| Kerman is a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| For that reason, it's surrounded by C3 zoning, other than the Newbert property, which is next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2323)|
| 0:38:52| and as Councilwoman Ryder said, the condition evidently had to do with the outdoor storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| so that's been a concern all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| That's why they recommended, or we recommended C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and the Planning Commission adopted that recommendation and forwarded it on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Yeah, well, I guess what I found curious was there was precious little discussion by the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| and I think my colleagues and I all relied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| You wrote a really good staff report, and they had no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| He did have a good staff at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I had a question for Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| As you heard, oftentimes people request C4 for outdoor storage, car lots or junk or any other type of outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2374)|
| 0:39:45| Can you explain your need for C4 in this instance and why C3 doesn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| I don't own any car lots or mobile home lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| In fact, I've replaced quite a few over the years, and we've mainly developed for in-national retail users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| Cheddar's, Lowe's, Kroger, Walgreen, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| And so we've had ‑‑ our desire is to, because it's a small site, and to get the kind of ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2406)|
| 0:40:16| our primary goal is to get a hotel that's going to have to go vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| We think it would be a good location there right across from Wallace Memorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| and would tie in with what we're doing and help, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Everything we've done on merchants, Clinton Highway, has been to lift the area up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| We've made ‑‑ we're probably 50-plus million investment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| You know, good or bad, I'm known as the Clinton Highway North Knoxville developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| and maybe it's because I drive by it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| But at any rate, we've done a good job, I think, with the Dunkin' Donut project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| and this property is owned by a retired dentist, and he finally decided he would do something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2451)|
| 0:41:01| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Normally, you know, C4 gives me a lot of heartburn, but looking at these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| I think I'm comfortable with Mr. Campin's eloquently put motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you, Marcia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| This is a question actually for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I think looking at this property, it does seem like a hotel would be a really appropriate use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| and so to have to rezone to make that happen seems like something that we're trying to get away from with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2488)|
| 0:41:37| So my question is, is this the type of situation that could potentially be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| through an updated zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| or will these types of exceptions always just sort of pop up on these types of projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| At today's MPC agenda review meeting, it seems like every case that comes up now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| we talk about if recode, if it were adopted, we could be doing this or doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| As a matter of fact, they even talked about the potential of can we put some of these things off until recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| But there's, you know, recode is in the review process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| and there's all types of possibilities as to how the zoning ordinance could be structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| to be more flexible, less flexible, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And from that standpoint, it's in essence an open book right now with the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| if you have good ideas of how to regulate property, then certainly put them out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2552)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| I just want to address Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| For those of us who have been in Knoxville for quite a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| we can remember the transition that Clinton Highway area has had over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| from being pretty much aggressive to then kind of being the ghost town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| and there's still some slight areas in which that is evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| But I just want to compliment you and thank you for your investment in revitalization of the Clinton Highway area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| because you have substantially made a huge impact and difference in revitalization of the Clinton Highway area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| and so I just want to publicly thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| That was a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| That was a motion to amend to C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Hold on, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| We'll get you in just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| So this is now we're going to vote on the original ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Well, we've already got that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| We've already got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| You already have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| We have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Now you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| 12D is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Hinton Avenue southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| of North Central Street from I-2 District to O-1 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2646)|

| 0:44:17| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I just wondered if there was anyone here to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2659)|
| 0:44:30| Sir, if you'd please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2670)|

| 0:44:39| I was curious what – it was on consent agenda at MPC, so there was no history for me to look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| What prompted the zoning change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I'm not familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| This is walking distance from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| It's just an extension of our current facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Could you please speak a little louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Yeah, move the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| It's just an extension to our current facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| We currently have about 10 houses on Hinton Avenue, substance abuse rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| and we're just adding another house to hopefully help some more men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| So you recently purchased this property and are adding it to the rehab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| It had to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| How many residents will you be able to expand and include by adding this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Hopefully another six or eight men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| And how many do you collectively serve in that area there on Hinton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| Meaning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| How many individuals are you serving there on Hinton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Sixty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| We currently have 60 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| You have 60, and it's all halfway services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| One residential program, 12 beds for it, and the rest are 27 or halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| and the other three or four houses we have are what we call transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| which the halfway house program is a 90-day program, and for most of them that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| So we like for them to move into transitional housing and stay as long as they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| And how do you guys recruit or found individuals for your program there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| Well, currently it's not hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| A lot of probation people refer them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Probations, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Tennessee red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| I mean, we're licensed by the state of Tennessee for substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| I mean, the opioid addiction problem is just brutal right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| so there's no lack of individuals who actually have a waiting list for both our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| So for the opioid addiction, the timeframe to treat that is about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| 18 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Are you guys offering an 18-month program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| We will let them stay up to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| What happens to the other six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Well, you've got one month in the residential program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| and you've got three months in the halfway house program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| and then move into the transitional housing and stay up to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And we've had, you know, it just depends on the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Some recover quicker than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Some are financially back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Some of them have got a lot of child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| They've got court-caused fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| And, I mean, you know, they just gave themselves a bad hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| and they just can't bounce back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| They're felons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| They have a hard time finding work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| We're blessed that most of our guys are employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And, you know, it's an ongoing process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| We require them to make meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| They're required to meet with their counselor once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| They're required to make four or five outside meetings a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| So it keeps them involved in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| which is, you know, the only way that they're ever going to get back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| And hopefully by the time they get ready to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| they've, you know, reestablished some family relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| maybe got back visitation rights for their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| maybe mended fences with their wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| So you have case workers and staff that help them make those connections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| Yeah, we have 18 staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So it's a pretty big operation, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| So we need Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Mr. Lewis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| That's another question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Is there a name for the halfway house or the program that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| The treatment center is the Frank G. Kulinski Residential Treatment Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| The halfway house, the whole operation is EM Jellinc Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| The residential treatment is the inpatient part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| and the EM Jellinc Center is the halfway house part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| And the residential, which I'm trying to get this house to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| is just it's still a structured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| They've still got responsibilities to Jellinc and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| A lot of them cannot afford to leave, and they don't know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| Their families give up on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| And the longer we can keep them, the better their chances are of not relapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| And do you take self-referrals, or do they have to come through, be referred to an agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| We take self-referrals, but for the treatment center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| we like to get a referral from either a social worker or an attorney or a probation officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2952)|
| 0:49:22| I mean, the thing is right now that inpatient treatment is basically we've got grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2962)|
| 0:49:31| to cover indigent people, and that's what we deal with, people with no money and no insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| And that is, there's a big need for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| so we like to at least know that, yes, they have a drug problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| and it's ruined their life, and that they do need some treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| And that's what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| And hopefully we can keep them 28 days, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| and then we move them into the halfway house for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| So maybe they've got a job in that amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and maybe they're starting to feel a little better about their self-worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| and they can see that they can see the light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| That's the hard thing for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I mean, they've done drugs so long, and they've lost everything they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| no friends, no family, and it just takes years to rebuild that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| I know that from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I was an IV drug user, went through treatment, went over to jail in 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| and have been there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Now I'm the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| So I started over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| I cooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I lived in the halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| I got me a little side job, and just, you know, as time went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| just got more involved and more involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| and some of the other people retired, you know, and I went to work in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| And, of course, Frank Klinska, I don't know if any of you all know him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| but he was the executive director for probably 20 years, and he passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| So then I moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| It's rewarding work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| It's heart-wrenching work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Well, thank you for sharing that, and thank you for the service that you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| I think you'll be able to help a few more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| I mean, that's what we're all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| So we need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3078)|

| 0:51:50| Sandy Gillespie, 4272 Hallway Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| I'm president of the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and also a member of the Bearden Village Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| I know that the Western Plaza issue could have been handled better on the front end by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| I have known several of you for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and I greatly respect all of you for your strong interest in serving not only the city but our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180410?start=3136)|
