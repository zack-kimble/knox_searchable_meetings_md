| 0:00:05| If we could stand for the Pledge of Allegiance of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10)|
| 0:00:19| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=19)|

| 0:00:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Commissioner Ballard. Commissioner Wright. Here. Commissioner DeFries. Here. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=56)|
| 0:01:02| Pinkston. Here. 14 members present. 14 members out of 19 are present. Mr. Chairman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=62)|
| 0:01:14| Commissioner Ballard is celebrating in Florida the wedding of his son over the weekend. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| may be on his way here today, but his absence is caused by that celebration. Okay. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| you. I hope not too much celebration. We have a long schedule. I try to give each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| 15 minutes. I think each one of you have a schedule. I try to stick to it as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| I can or we can. First up, Juvenile Judge. Anyone here from Juvenile Judge? Welcome to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=100)|
| 0:01:51| Cuddy's Budget. Zero. Second. I see Lynn. She's here. Air Quality Management. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=111)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Commissioner. Lynn Livington, Director of Knox County Air Quality Management. I want to give you just a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| background on the department, a little better understanding. Knox County Air Quality Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| operates under a certificate of exemption from the state of Tennessee to enforce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| regulations for the control of air pollution, which are as stringent as the state's. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| authority extends to all of Knox County, including the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| The state, in turn, receives its authority from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| We are then, in effect, enforcing federal law at a local level. Though we receive our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| authority from the state, the state contributes no money to our budget. We negotiate our grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| funding directly with EPA. Region 4 in Atlanta, our grants vary from year to year. Some are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| continuing grants, one requires a local match, and none of the grants have dates that correspond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| with the county budget. So you can imagine the fun that finance has with our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| We are audited on all phases of our program by the state of Tennessee and U.S. EPA on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual basis. We have a negotiated annual work plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| with EPA that requires regular reporting. Our continued funding is contingent on satisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| completion of that work plan. Now, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments dictated that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| sources that emit air contaminants into the air pay a permit fee based on the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| pollution that they emit on an annual basis. These permit fees, combined with federal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| local funds, are what constitute our air quality management funding. Now, my funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| is broken down into five separate budgets. I have what is called a PM 2.5. It's a federally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| funded grant. There is no local match attached to that budget. The second one is our regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| operating budget. It is composed of a federal grant and a local match. I have a permit fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| budget and then a Title V permit fee budget. The distinction being that Title V sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| EPA dictates that those have to be managed separately. Therefore, we have two separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| budgets. And then finally, we have $10,000 that we take out of the non-Title V budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| fees to support the Knox County employees in smart trips. Our staff, 15 people. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=287)|
| 0:04:57| 15 people are divided among the four main budgets and their scopes of work vary within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| all of those. We do have equipment items in this year's budget that are related to ozone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| monitoring that EPA is requiring us to replace. We are non-attainment for ozone as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| PM 2.5, meaning that we do not meet the federal standards. We need to have the most accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| and current equipment in the field to verify our mandated attainment status. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| one PM 2.5 sampler in there and three pieces of ozone equipment. And since we are based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| out of EPA Region 4, most of our meetings and training are located outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| This is what necessitates our travel budget. And if you have any particular questions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| any of the budgets or any other questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:58| One quick question. Looking down the road for budgets, will there be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| do you expect certain steps we'll need to bring ourselves back into attainment, certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| costly steps? As far as the cost, that is still unknown. There could be some. Hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| we will get federal and state funding for those as we have been doing in the past. Most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| of the programs that we've put into place for the present non-attainment for ozone are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=383)|
| 0:06:32| being handled at the federal level. Thank you. You're welcome. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Yeah, that's kind of a follow-up. Are there going to be penalties down the road for non-attainment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| And I guess a follow-up question to that is in terms of our geography in this valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| and fossil fuel plants and things of that nature, is it really feasible for us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| us meeting or beating any standards as they continue to ratchet it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| That's one of the things right now. We came extremely close last year to meeting the ozone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| standard and we'll in all probability meet it. I have to call it the old standard now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| This year, EPA, before we've even met that standard, has imposed a new standard on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| that we will have to meet by 2013. This new standard is going to take in most of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=445)|
| 0:07:34| Tennessee as well. So it's not something that a local county, one county, can handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| on their own. It's a regional, it's a statewide effort. As far as ozone and PM 2.5, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| particulate matter go, it's a southeastern problem. The results you will see across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=466)|
| 0:07:55| board, but they're going to have to come from federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Okay, and there aren't any penalties on down the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Actually, there can be way down the road. There can be programs, but we've got quite a few years to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| Commissioner Lutow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Lynn, and maybe just for John as well, when we take a look at your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| budget here and the expenditures, a lot of this is grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I guess those are federal grants you'd meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| And it's not reflected within our budget. So is that common to not have that when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| doing the budget, to know what the amount of those grants are going to be and not reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| it? Because the budget we have before us doesn't even, we've just got zeros down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| Right. I just got the PM 2.5 budget, just turned it in this morning to be heard at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| June meeting. So we do know that we have $125,000 from that. The main EPA grant does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| not start until the 1st of October. Generally, we don't receive the funding on that until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| six months or so into the budget, into the county budget year. This PM 2.5 budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| we just got, it actually started the 1st of April. So we have to do a lot of guessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| because, like I had said earlier in my comments, none of these grant budgets correspond with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| a county year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So when we take a look at the budget, we're expecting, what, another million dollars coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| in from the federal government? Is that what you, I mean, because over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| it's been 1.2 and we only got 199, so that's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| I just want to add just a little bit of information. What we tried to present this year is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| the local money and last year's money included the federal grants and what our approach would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| be is just the county commission to approve the local money through the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| and as the grants are approved throughout the year, then we add that to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And so what you're seeing now is just local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| So when we talk about the budget only growing 1.8%, really it's another million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=609)|
| 0:10:18| as compared to last year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| We expect...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Because last year's budget would have included that million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| We expect that air quality will get another million dollars through federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| So to say that our budget only increased 1.8 million dollars isn't quite correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| because we're not accounting for the million dollars that we normally get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| What our approach would be is to add it as we go, as they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| What is your, I guess, your unit number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| Is it the only one, your department number, or does it have a unit number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| There's five separate budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| They start with 215 and then it's 0010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| I see all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| So that takes care of the operation, salaries and everything for your whole department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Yeah, each year we look at the, we take the 15 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| We make sure that they're being properly represented in the correct budgets according to what the work is that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| John, before we get to approve a budget, can you give us, you're saying these numbers here are just the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=696)|
| 0:11:45| So last year, like Commissioner Leuthold said, it had, I guess, the grant money in there with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| It's federal plus the local, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| So can you give us what you anticipate the revenue from the grants would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| and then how does that reflect the current budget that's being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Lynn just handed me one of the grants this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| And, you know, rather than speculate, we thought it would be more prudent to add it as we go and get actual numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| And that way there's no speculation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Well, I know, but you've got last year is like 1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| We expect a similar number this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| This year they requested 1.2, but it's only showing 199.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| So is 199 all the money except for the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| We expect about a million dollars in grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| And if you don't get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| We don't spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| Commissioner, seeing no other questions, thank you, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Dick Moran, you want to move up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| I left him off the list, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Dick Moran, Senior Director of Information and Technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| I couldn't help but notice we were omitted from the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I hope that's not a reflection of the commission's intent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Well, you have no budget, so we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| It is a difficult and a tight budget, and we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| These are difficult times for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| I would point out that we're pretty much a service bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| We serve all the other departments and the elected offices in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So when we get changes or reflections in our budget, it affects other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| We have to pass those along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| We have not had any increases in our operating budget in the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I think we've been good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| We've consolidated servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| We've gone to less expensive software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| But we're pretty much running out of rabbits to pull out of the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| So I'll be glad to answer any questions anybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And we'll probably sit through most of these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| since we do serve all the other departments in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| So we'll be interested in what they have to say also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| I'm looking at page 120 of the online version of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| Information Technology Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| There's a line item there for $850,000 in legal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| Can you tell me what we are buying with that $850,000 in legal services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| It's probably not labeled correctly because those are software licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| Software licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Licenses and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| I didn't see any similar item for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Is this new software acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| It was in there last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| At the same amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| So it's really software licenses, not a lawsuit or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Anyone from George Irwin's office here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| County clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I do want to report for the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| He is sick today and he won't be able to make the meetings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| He will be available later for commissioners to meet with individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| George did want to report that we have been over his proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and he's comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| He also wanted to say that as of January 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| the county clerk's office employed 128 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Currently that number is down by 17 to 111 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| and he expects to look for all the savings he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| John, do you know what, to date, the will taxes brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=969)|
| 0:16:20| Not offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| We'll get those numbers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| What about what he's turned over in excess fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I think the number offhand, I'm thinking it's around $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| but he saves the money toward the end of the year to make sure he makes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and then generally we get better at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| What about, do you know, as any type of fees that they collect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| like business tax, license, and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| how many we have outstanding balances on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Yeah, I think you'd need to get the clerk to report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| We've tried to get that and we haven't got it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| I mean, I think that's important going through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| If we know there's $20 million owed to Knox County government out there by businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| and, you know, why haven't we collected them or are we collecting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Nobody owes us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| John, I know Commissioner Moore just asked you about the will tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| You're estimating the will tax to bring in an extra $800,000 in revenues this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| And if you just take, if you divide the will tax into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| you're talking about an extra about 22,000 more vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| that are going to have to register over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| So, I mean, are we really growing that fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| that we're going to have that much of a net increase in the number of people paying the will tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| Yeah, I've been over the numbers with the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| And one of the things that I think is important to mention is that starting in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| the county clerk has asked for verification for people on the exemption list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| And they're collecting more in April, more in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| from people who used to get exemptions who now don't get exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And so that is increasing our revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| And from what I understand, even if we collected all of it and no one was exempted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| it only comes up to a little over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| So we're talking about still coming up with an extra $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Yeah, the number, the way the county clerk reported to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and that's where I get my numbers is from the county clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| the number is about $260,000 for that piece of it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Now, another piece is going to be the growth of just there's more people in Knox County every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| So there's going to be a little bit more every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| And another piece of this is the difference on the 17 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And so it's going to be the county clerk is spending less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| and so actually it's amounts that the county clerk is going to turn over through excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| And so part of that money should really be classified as excess fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| but the county clerk said he's very comfortable with these revenue estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| So the $800,000 isn't necessarily all increasing the number of people paying will tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:32| It also has to do that he feels that he'll be able to turn over more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Right, with 17 fewer people, right, on the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Are you reporting back to the clerk on any questions that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| I will certainly do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I'll go back to the Rota Formosa report, which was given to us about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| In the clerk's office, it was reported that there was no policy on cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Would you see if there has been a policy on cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I'd also like to know how many cell phones they have and exactly how those cell phones are used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| There was also a notation here that a travel allowance is paid to certain employees each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| even if the expense of actual travel differs from the allowance amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Would you check and see if that's been rectified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| There was also, with regards to wheel tax waivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I'd like to know if they've tightened up on the number of waivers that have been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And also there was a report that nine employees are working from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| And there may be a good reason why that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I'd be interested to know how many employees are indeed working at home and what they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| And also with regards to the petty cash, if the petty cash has been, I think it has been taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| but it's supposed to be reported, I think, within three days according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| And I'd like to make sure that that has been taken care of and we're in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| So if you would just ask him those questions, I'll be meeting with him, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| But I'd like for him to have those answers when I get together with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| As far as the employees working from home, it's my understanding, I think you'll want to confirm that with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| that he doesn't have anybody working from home and that petty cash is no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Oh, I turned your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| A couple of questions I hope you'll take back or perhaps you can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Page 12 of the online version of the budget, there's a $14,000 contract with PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| and I'm just wondering what is PBA doing beyond its normal duties in that extra contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Also on page 16 and 17 of the online budget, there's a line item for $192,040 in other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:55| I'd like to know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| And I'd also like to know why there are costs for both space rental and space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:19| Yeah, the county clerk pays rent in Easttown, and that space rental is the cost of the Easttown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:29| The $14,000 contract with PBA includes the new location at Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| and that's the work that they're doing there as a shared location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and the regular space cost includes the old courthouse right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| That's the space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Presumably that's paid to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Right, that's all paid to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, so we have a space cost thing paid to PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| but we also have a separate $14,000 contract with PBA on page 12, and I'd like to know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| The Cedar Bluff location, so that includes the custodial and utilities at the Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So those are separated out, those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| John, there have been a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Do you think we can move this county clerk to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and maybe his chief deputy or somebody could come, and if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| can you get us the totals from what's the actual from your department finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| the actual amount turned over from the will tax, what is the actual turned over in excess fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| What we'll do is we'll make a request of the county clerk's office, and we can give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| I'm sure at one of the breaks we'll make a will tax total for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| And excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Are there any other questions on the county clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I'm not seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Our law director is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| John, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| I don't really have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I thought you all might have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| My only concern is gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| But that's the same as everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| I thought you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I think we ought to cut his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I know a house we can make it up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I think if you look at it, he already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| I was going to say, Scott's really angling for a nice Christmas present this year, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I'm looking at pages 124 and 125 of the online budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Why is there $219,000 in health insurance when year-to-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| and last year are actually more in the $4,000 to $7,000 range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| The health insurance is just a fixed cost for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Well, it went up by a huge amount, and I'm just wondering why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I'd like to jump in on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| If you look at the next two line items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| health insurance is split really between four line items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| and you see that there's, depending on which plan the employees choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| And so we just provide more detail there than what the total health insurance does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| and it would be all the 92.30s combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| And so you see one is $4,000, one is $20,000, and another is $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| There's three different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| The only other question I have regarding that is there's a line for something called property assessor reappraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| $155,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| There was zero in this category last year, and I'm just wondering what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Every four years we have a reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| And in the year 2009, we have the reappraisal turning over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| And most of that will be postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| We have to send out over 180,000 notices, plus the county board has to send out notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| and we'll send out a second notice for people who appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| That is all postage, or the biggest part of it is postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I'm looking at the budget workbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| It's on page 58 where we're looking at the five, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| the five areas of personnel services, employee benefit, contractual services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| You know, the personnel services is actually decreased from the physical year 08 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| but the contractual services increased $130,000 from $557,000 to $685,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| and also the supplies and materials increased by $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| And though it had been relatively stable for the past couple of years, is the gasoline in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Or what are the contractual services that have increased and the supplies and materials that have increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Well, the supplies and materials we had to increase because of the reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| We have to send out notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| We have to print the notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| That is all printer cost and notice cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Now, as far as the contracts go, the only contract I'm aware of is tax management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| And then our license and agreements with our software companies, they probably went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| Yeah, because I was just wondering, because if you look at physical year 06, 07, and 08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| it was really flat at about roughly $560,000, and then it jumped up to $685,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| The only contract there that we have that we have an option on is tax management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| They do personal property, and they actually pay for theirself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| They bring in about as much money as we spend on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| I don't know the exact cost on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I don't know what the contract was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| No, I was just wondering why that increased about 20 percent when it had been, you know, over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| The only increase I'm aware of would be because of the postage and the printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| Well, that would fall under supplies and material and not contractual services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Unless our software company raised their licensing fee, I know Marshall and Swift, we use their cost manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| I do know they went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Hey, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| John, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| Are you talking about the audit firm that's going through the personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| That may be part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| And I think their fee is set up to where if they audit a larger firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| that they're receiving money back on a percentage basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| So if they, say, audit some bigger firms next year, then they'll get back more money versus some smaller ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| And that may be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I don't know what their plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I don't think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| That could be part of it, but I don't think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I noticed that there was a request for an additional vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| and I was wondering how many vehicles the property assessor's office has and why two more were requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| We have 19 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| And one of them, the one or two, we asked for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I don't know if we got one or two approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| But one of them that they replaced would be seven years old and over 100,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Commissioner Labreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| The vehicle that you're requesting, what type of vehicles are you using now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| and what type of vehicle are you wanting the county to purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And have you taken fuel economy into consideration when you made that choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| We asked for a Ford Explorer to replace Ford Explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| We have mostly Jeep Cherokees and Ford Explorers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| So you need a four-wheel drive vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| It's better for us to have four-wheel drives for places they go, new construction sites, get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Would you consider getting an Explorer that is flex fuel rated so that if flex fuel becomes more available in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| that you'll be able to use the more economical fuel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| We'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| I think Ford has that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Yeah, they do, and I don't think it's that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| I mean, it's a very, it's not that big of an increase in the price, and it may save us money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Judge Ervin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Commissioners, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I was not given notice of an 830 budget hearing this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| No one asked for my office's participation, but I got word you were looking for me, so I came as soon as I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| And I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| We haven't asked for a lot of increases at juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| One of the things that I have been told was put in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| and I'm sort of talking off the cuff, was a new referee position and supporting staff for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| We have 125 more children in state custody this year than we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| If you are waiting on a trial to determine whether or not you're essentially getting your kids back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| the wait's about five and a half months right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| That's too long for people to find out whether or not they're going to be able to keep their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| That's too long for a final hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| The metro area of Chattanooga has seven referees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| We're working on five and three-quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| What I've asked the commission and the mayor's office to consider was moving us up on equal par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| This position would be another dependent and neglected referee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| who would take some of the workload off Kay Casterman, Irene Joseph, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| Also accompanying that position would be another case manager for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Then, of course, it would require a clerk and a security officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I've been told by the mayor's office and the finance office that with the hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| that position was going to be approved in January, and we're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| We can keep rowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| We'll pick up our shovels and go to the mine until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| But that's the reason for the ask, and that's the reason for the real need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| I don't think a lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| There have been a lot of other requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I did ask for one part-time person to pick up an extra ten hours in child support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| to ease some of the overcrowding over there, but there haven't been a lot of other changes other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| Business has been good. Business has been too good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| We are concerned at Juvenile Court with some of the federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| how that's going to affect us as the cuts come through DCS and down through our support agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| We are looking at the loss of two very crucial programs, Interchange as well as our home base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| our most intensive form of probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| We had some 270 children on that last year, and that's going to be taken away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Those are probation officers that actually go in the homes at night, check, see if kids are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| It was a way for us to avoid custody, and we understand that program is going away through lack of federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| so we'll be maybe even having more kids in custody, which necessitates more reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| which takes more referee and judge time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| There's no one going home early in the afternoon at Knox County Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I can assure you we're all working full days, and it's a busy place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| But I'm here to answer any questions you have about our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Without Heidi, I'm sort of paralyzed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| She's on vacation, but like I said, we didn't get noticed, but I'll do the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I'm pretty familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Judge, do you know if the Mediation Center is going to be funded again this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| The Mediation Center, what we do as well as the other courts in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| is we have a dollar of our litigation costs that go off to fund the Mediation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| and it's vital to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| The main way the Mediation Center affects juvenile court is if you come to child support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and at the end of the child support proceeding you say, okay, this is my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| I'm paying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I want to see the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Well, we naturally refer those cases to mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| And so we're a big user of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| That's the number one way we use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And one dollar out of every litigation tax or fee that's paid in the Knox County Sessions Courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| at juvenile court at our building goes to fund the Mediation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| And we have been collecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I have not asked for any extra funding in my budget this year for the Mediation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| So there is funding in there, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Well, there's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| I don't know if it's going to be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| It seems like it never is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Yeah, it's funded at $50,000, same as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| That's very important, like you said, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| It's crucial to our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| It would even be a longer wait without the fine work that Jack developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I would think without it we would be spending more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| We wouldn't need just one referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| We might need two or three without the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Maybe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| We've got 100,000 more people in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| and we're making it on one and a half referees less right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And it's catching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I mean, people are working through lunch, working way up in the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| and I have got to get some relief not only for my referees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| but also for the people waiting on their trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Five and a half months is too long to wait to see whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| or not you're going to get your kids back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| It's just too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Yeah, page 24 of the online budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| There's listed there $45,000 in other professional services needed by the juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| That's Marie Bly's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| That money was taken when Larry Gibney was our court director for 36 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| When he retired, we basically took part of his salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and hired Marie Bly on a contract basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| She's not an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| She's hired on a contract basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| She manages five interns from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| who are graduate students in the field of social work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and she works on the prevention side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| When someone comes to juvenile court, a parent that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| I can't do this anymore, it's her staff and her kids that meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And I believe that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| That's the only thing I can think of that's in that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| And are those interns the $10,000 in part-time seasonal work on page 26 most likely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| Most likely, that's my best guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Without Heidi here, I'm sorry, I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| but I know there are five interns that get a stipend of $1,000 apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| so that doesn't make $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| The $10,000 could be our restorative justice program as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| where we have a part-time person who manages kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| who go out and do community service work every Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| That may be where that $10,000 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| I think the $5,000 came from a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| I don't think it's in there for the interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Also, there's a $167,000 contract with PBA when there was none last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| I have no idea about PBA or what PBA does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| They're painting, I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| They're painting the building in the parking lot, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| That's a lot of painting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I'm just trying to figure out what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| The other thing is there was a $2,000 jump in office supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| I mean, in a tight budget, can we really do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| A $2,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Yeah, we went from a little under $7,000 to $9,000 in office supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| Copier problems, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| We thought with the new referee that there would need to be some additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| And there is going to be more paperwork generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| But shortcomings from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| I know that one of the main concerns was I have two budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| I have juvenile court and I have child support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| And I know we had to rob from juvenile court to keep the cars running to go out and serve people at child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| But I don't know where the $2,000 increase was from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| I wish I had Heidi down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| She could be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| But I cannot answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| I can answer the big picture items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Yeah, and actually on page 27 there's another jump in office supplies from a little less than $1,300 to $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| I'm not sure where that's coming from either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| And finally, on that same, well, actually on page 29, the juvenile service center, do you deal with the juvenile service center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Okay, because that has a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| It's not mine, but I deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Because there's a $450,000 contract with PBA, again, a mystery contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| I don't know where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| I'm trying to be the best judge I can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| But if I told you I understood the relationships between PBA and servicing up Keep the Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| I'd be less than truthful because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I just heard you needed me down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Heidi Garrett would be more comfortable in answering many of these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and I wish I could get her here for you, but she's on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| We've seen some. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Another place where we've seen, page 27, we've seen an equipment increase of $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| And, again, it may be that that added person explains that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| But thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| That's really all we've asked for that I know that's any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| How does the Catholic Columbus Home, I noticed there's $60,000 designated for beds for juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| Could you please explain that arrangement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| The Columbus Home, as well as Blount County Children's Home, Tarleton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| many of your traditional congregate care facilities were extinguished when the Brian A. lawsuits came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:48| And Brian A. lawsuits ended congregate care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| The Department of Children's Services went to foster care completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| About three years ago, we discovered a severe need for a place for children in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| when both parents were arrested, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| A place for children to go when we had to take mom or dad into custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| or a place for children to go when they were left on a doorstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| We reactivated that function of Columbus Home, which has always been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| It had gone to a home for boys more than an emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| and it's been active for the past three years as an emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| that is now located just across the way from juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| So instead of making the 92 phone calls to foster families in the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| the Department of Children's Services could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| we're going to set this child here for 24, 48 hours, try to find grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| It's less traumatic for the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| It's cost-effective for the court because we can walk across the street and do our assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| Do they take the girls also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| They take children up to the age of 18, boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Boys over 14 have to stay somewhere else because we don't mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| but they take girls all the way to 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| and it's just a program that we asked Columbus Home to consider reactivating because of a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| And it not only helps juvenile court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| it helps the Department of Children's Services who also participate in the funding of that program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| But that's been in our line budget, I think, for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| I wanted to address Commissioner Harmon's question earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| The 9360 last year added an item of $426,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| and that was the Columbus Home contract plus the PBA contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| In the current year, what we've done is we've split them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| The PBA contract is $167,000, the Columbus Home is $259,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| and those two pieces together are the same number as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Do you issue fines for juveniles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Do you know to date what you've collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I couldn't tell you, but I know our fees have increased every year since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| We also increased the basic cost of our fee structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| and we've also recently begun taking a look at in-housing some of the schools that we refer children to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| and we've begun to explore that process in order to increase revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Because I was assured if I increased the revenue, I might be able to keep some of it at juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| So we've been working very hard in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| But our collections, one of the things I instituted was every six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| I have an outstanding fines and costs day and put them all on the docket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| and put it to people and ask them why we haven't gotten this paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| And it's been very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I think we were down to 15 files with the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| I can't tell you the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| I just know our collections have continued to rise every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| The clerk may be getting credit for that, but we've been working very hard together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| And my compliments to Ms. Quist and her staff, particularly Elaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| They have done a great job in helping us get organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| One of the recent changes we made was we switched payment of restitution to the clerk's office where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Juvenile court handles no money at this time at all for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| That's all coming through Ms. Quist and the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| But I think we have shown a large increase in fees in each year since I've been in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| and I think that will continue through 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And we're going to look at putting some of this traffic school, underage alcohol class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| some of those schools back in, looking at getting juvenile courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| some of that money that's currently being done by some private offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| We've been encouraged to do that, and we're going to embrace that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Some of the kids that may be incarcerated, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| do you see what percentage is mentally ill or have some kind of mental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| It's hard to say first, Commissioner, what came first, the chicken or the egg sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Some of the kids that I see I know are disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| Some of them that I see I know are dependent on some type of substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| Most of the children I see are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| They're not born that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| They're created because they have realized and rebelled against the fact that nobody's there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| It's a lack of father, lack of mother, lack of somebody in their corner that cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| And that's the damage that you see when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And that's what's difficult for a school to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| It's difficult for a church to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| It's difficult for a juvenile court to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| When a child realizes that they're alone in the world, then they rebel and they act out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| And most of my cases could be solved if I had an adult for each child that I've got that was in their corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| watching them, being there, knowing where they were, caring about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| I could take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| But I do see, you know, maybe I'd say less than 2% mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| but a lot of kids heading towards mental illness because of the stress of having no one to love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Can you give me all your account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Do you know your account numbers, where everything comes from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| John Troyer, do you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| I can't give you any account numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| It's just hard to understand because there's so many different places that everything comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Yeah, it's 1002410 and 1002420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Mr. Gibney, for 36 years, he kept everything up there pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| And we've tried to stay with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| We think that that's a good way to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| You go and ask for paperclips, you get three or four paperclips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| You don't get a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Believe me, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| When you go ask for staples, the lady that's in charge of those gives you one row to put in your stapler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| Things are pretty tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| I can't keep pens because my employees keep borrowing my pens because we're not very free in handing them out, evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| But I don't know where the increase of $2,000 additional office supplies is, but I'll find it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| I don't know what it is, but I will find it, and I'll have Ms. Garrett up here to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And I apologize for not being more prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Again, I'm caught a little bit unawares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I was pretty much in agreement with what was submitted out and didn't know I'd need to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| but I came as soon as I got the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Judge, this question may be better answered by Mr. Bean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| but at one time some of the wings and pods out at the Richard Bean Juvenile Service Center were mothballed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| Do you know where we are with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| We have one, but we're going to need it, and I'm going to tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| We're getting ready to hit a catastrophe with state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| I don't have beds to send kids now, and $73 million has been cut from the Department of Children's Services budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Those children are going to be housed and annexed, waiting on placement right there in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| It's a good thing we have that extra pod because it's fixing to be called into use, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| I hope not, but I'm afraid that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| And it was great foresight on the part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| We'll probably have to limit some of the kids that we take in from other places because it's a Knox County place first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| But Mr. Bean is in pretty good shape number-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| We still have some capacity, but we're getting ready to push it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| because we're not going to have state facilities to send these kids on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Do you receive money from the state for each juvenile that's housed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Mr. Bean does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| We're on separate budgets, but he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| And I think it's $120 some odd a day, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I'd be speaking out of turn, but he does receive, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| He holds a kid for Anderson County or any of the other counties that we help out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| And it's good that we have the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| We have the lowest commitment rate in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| We have less kids in custody than any of the other places per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| And at one time, Steve Hornsby told me that might be the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| We're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| We work very hard to keep kids out of detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| We have a Boys and Girls Club working in our detention when the kids do get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| that meet with them and counsel with them and try to keep them from coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| We have a doctor now that we didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Mr. Bean's done a wonderful job and been very innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| And this sounds like a small thing, but we test for social disease when a kid comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| and we find a lot of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| It's a lot of sexually transmitted disease among our kids that are in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| And that sounds, again, like a small thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| but I think it's very important that we get that cured and we stop the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| And Mr. Bean's been very innovative in a lot of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| And I have been very impressed with the efficiency of the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| I don't have a lot to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| I try not to fill it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| We really don't like sending the Knox County children to detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| but if we have to send them somewhere, I prefer to send them to a place that's clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| where they'll be well cared for, where they'll get some services, where there's a doctor available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| And I know we have that option in Knox County now, and I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Can you tell us how the kids are educated over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| the ones that are locked up for long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Teachers, and it's run by the Knox, it's coordinated by the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| We have teachers and classes, and they go to school every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| And it's more of a generic curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| It's not a specific curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| And that may have to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Our detention facility is undergoing national accreditation right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and that's something else we're very excited about, and that's a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| But one of the things that's being examined is the curriculum that the kids have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| It's not necessarily sufficient in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| It's more of a worksheet, complete the project, than an individual instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| And it may be, with such a transient population, it may be what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| But they are getting something every day, and there is a library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and a school is made available to every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Judge, with the state's budget in juvenile services being cut $73 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| do you see, is there anything in your budget that reflects the possibility of that causing you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| This news came out long after we prepared those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| The two things I need, I need to be able to hire two of the home-based workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| so I can manage that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| This is the most dangerous form of probation we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| These are kids that have done violent things that we have decided to monitor from their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And these people actually go into the homes, check and see if they're there, perform drug tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| I mean, it's three or four nights a week looking in on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| It's more intensive services than I could provide without these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| Well, actually, there's four of them, but if I could have two of them, I'd be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| But, you know, with the hiring freeze and all, I don't even dare ask right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Yeah, that's going to cripple me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| It costs $272 a day to house a child at Mountain View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| It costs $9.65 a day to keep a child on home base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| And home base is being extinguished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| And that's 270 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| And that's going to be federal dollars that trickle down through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| that we're not going to get to keep those problems open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| And those are interchanges, a program on the front end that heads off petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| So what we're going to see are more petitions on the front end and more custody on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| We're already up 125 kids, 125 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Last year I think it was 600 kids in custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| This year it's headed towards, this year already we're at 725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| That's a big increase, a big jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| We're not seeing perhaps as many delinquent matters, but we're seeing more violent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| And we are concerned, and we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And we're concerned when we see prevention dollars going by the wayside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| because we know that means a bigger debt to pay in the end by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Judge, do you have any idea why that's happened, that jump?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| I mean, is it the economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I think the economy probably has a little to do with it, but I think that it's just a cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| I think that the law enforcement did a great job a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| cleaning out some of the major organizers of the drug trade and crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| and I think some of those players have been replaced by younger soldiers, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| that have fallen within my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| And it's pretty easy to attract the young and the naive when you show them nice things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| and show them what kind of money can be earned when a kid doesn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| It makes them a pretty easy bark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| And I think that's one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| A lot of gun stuff lately, and it's very concerning, very disconcerting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| Referee Weddington and I are both seeing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| and I'm sure you've read about a lot of gun crimes lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| And there's no sign that this phenomenon is going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| but we're going to do what we can to protect Knox County and protect the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| We'd like to have an option of a good, strong last resort to detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| but it looks like that's going to be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| So that invariably means we're going to have to lock more kids up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| because they're not suitable for regular probation and being let loose in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you, Judge Irving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| I wish I had a brighter picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| but the reason I didn't plan on being here this morning is we're going to try to live with a hiring freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| like the rest of the departments in Knox County and do our best to be fiscally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| And I'll be glad to make Ms. Garrett available to any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| if you have individual questions that I wasn't able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Like I say, I did not have any notice of this meeting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| I don't know how that happened, but I've done the best I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| You did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| John Owens, Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| Before he gets away, I may have a spare box of staples if we could give Judge Irving his own box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:47| Let me give you a little bit of bad news first before we get into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| We have an inconsistency in two of our ordinances that we just adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| and I didn't catch it until I started drafting the ballot questions for the two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| In order to fix that, and let me tell you which two ordinances it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| it's the ones dealing with the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| So we've got Commissioners Luthold's ordinance and Daniels and Davis, their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| We need to have two special called meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| When is the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| And it will last about two seconds is all we'll need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| But when is the next budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| On the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| We have the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| We're going to have the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Can we all come Wednesday to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| And then we have our committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| We have the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Of course, that's not enough time for the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| The next meeting will be on the 11th, the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| When is the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Is that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| But you need three days, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| We can do it Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| That's agenda because most people will come to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| We'll get it out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| John, usually only three or four commissioners will be at the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| It's not going to be anything you haven't already approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| but there's such an inconsistency if we put both questions on the ballot and both were to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| then we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Can we wait until the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| We can't wait that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| We've got to have that is if we want to conclude it on the 16th on committee day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| which I would prefer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| We can't do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Can't do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Wednesday is doable, but that requires about everybody to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| And I don't, you know, usually we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Well, can, I mean, Mr. Chairman, can you ask to see if commissioners can be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| If we have a special call meeting on Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| How many can be here for the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| The agenda meeting is at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| He said it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| One-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| One-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| I'm sorry, one-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| It won't take, you know, roughly five minutes to pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| What we want to do is to basically repeal what we've done, and we're drafting a new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| You all may wish to tweak it some this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| But roughly, if you don't, we're looking at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Wednesday would be fine, and then on committee day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| Now we've divided our committees on different days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| We would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Nothing's easy, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| Unless we want to go back to having one more month of a combined intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| I'll second that if it's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Well, I don't know that I can do that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| So you need the second reading to be before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Before the commission meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| I don't feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Can we do it on the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| We need seven days between readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| That's seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| So if we have the first reading this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| We can have the next one on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| If that's seven days, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| How many people can be here Wednesday at 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| We need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Yeah, you can bring it on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| We need 13 to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Fool to be here from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| So we do have 11 that said that they could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| We're going to need 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| We need 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| 13 yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Phil may be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| We'll give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Don, could we suspend the rules on this right now since you're all of us here and do something on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| I think we still have to have a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| This is not a noticed meeting, not for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| Let's attempt to try to have 13 people here at the agenda meeting at 1.30 Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| Then we can take the second on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Wednesday at 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Yes, Wednesday at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| It's Wednesday at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Can we put that early on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| We can make that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| On what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| This topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Special call meeting to approve an ordinance and rescind two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| You'll send a notice out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Yes, we'll get with Jolie and we'll get that out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| It will make our job a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| The budget that we prepared for this year is what I think basically a wash from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:22| We added a few dollars in more or less reorganized, added a few dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| Looks like the law director's salary goes up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| So we added about $43,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| We took out $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| We decreased the budget, decreased office supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| I may ought to hang on to those staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| But we decreased a few items there for $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| I believe the mayor cut an additional $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| And that's from travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I think they cut about everybody's travel budget a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| But the one difference is that I see there is an additional staff person added to this budget that I didn't request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:18| We have 16 staffers, which includes myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| We have eight attorneys, which includes myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| We have six secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| We have an investigator, and we have a certified paralegal for a total of 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| There is an additional staff person with salaries and fringe benefits, which totals about $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:48| I would suggest that that position is not needed, that that position is not necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| and that perhaps Tim Irwin, juvenile court, maybe they can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| But that position, as far as I'm concerned, is not necessary and not needed in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:10| Don, if you didn't request that, who did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Who put that in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I'd like to jump in on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I have met with the incoming law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| and that was his request to be able to bring his secretary with him as he took office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| and we provided that in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| We're doing just fine with the staff that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| If you wish to place those monies somewhere else, then my successor would have a tough choice to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:48| whether he wished to bring in his own secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| or whether he wished to use the people that are already in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| and well-versed in what we do and utilize their skills and talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| So, in any event, that's in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| You say 16 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Does that count yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Well, I'm looking here, and it's got 18 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| A couple of part-time law clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| I really don't count those as employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| They sign a contract to work for us at $10 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| We may use them 10 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| We may use them 20 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| It just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| But we get usually second- and third-year law students to do some law clerking for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| as well as it gives them experience in what they may wish to do one of these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| We just had a young lady who wishes to practice in government law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| and she spent about a year with us roughly working about 15 to 20 hours a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| while going to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| They do a good bit of research for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Mr. Troyer, does the finance department believe that this position is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:21| I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I put it in the budget, and I thought it was a fair request for an incumbent officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| I think maybe Mr. Owings could talk about the next unit code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| Underneath that is the law director's legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| I think that's at least worth mentioning a little bit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| If you all would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| I mean, you're running the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Well, I just want to make sure that the finance department is saying this position is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| because the law director is saying it's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| I mean, in a budget time, we've got a law director coming into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| but he hasn't been in the office to see how it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| So how can he say that we need additional people right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| I'm just sharing with you his request to bring his secretary with him to start his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| Let me tell you, with an additional person, too, the office is going to need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:35| And I don't know where that person will sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| But right now we have two of our employees virtually in closets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:49| The lawyers are all on our side of the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| But we have our investigator who is in ñ it's a large room, but it's filled with file cabinets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| and she has a desk kind of stuck over in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| And then we have ñ and I would more or less call that a supply or a broom closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| We have another ñ our paralegal is also on that side of the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| You know, it would be nice to have everybody together, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| we do what you can do with the space that you're provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| But there's not another seat for an additional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| So there would need to be, in my opinion, at least some expansion of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| We have two persons who are secretaries in our reception area, but with, you know, file cabinets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| And we only keep the files that we need, the files that are recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| And we send the others, anything that's closed, we send that over to the old Sears building for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| So we're going to need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| We're going to need another area somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| We have a law clerk sitting in a little kiosk area of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| And it's not really ñ you know, it's just an alcove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| And we alternate our law clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| We don't have them there at the same time, same day, because we don't have the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Yes, I guess this question is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| So when the incoming law director came in and had the conversation with you about this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| did he justify the reason based on caseload, anything of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| or was it just, I'm used to working with this lady, and I'm just trying to figure out why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| Part of the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| He wanted to bring this person in, and that's the person he wants to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| And part of the answer is an assessment of the workload of the total office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| And so I think the incoming law director understands that the law director's office handles a lot of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| and a lot of business, and there's just a lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| So I'm sure that you all emphasized to him the budgetary situation going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| And did he have any ñ well, I guess this is for Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Did he have any conversations with you about the workload?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I guess what I'm trying to understand is the basis of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| So did he monitor law director operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Did he look at ñ see what the workload was for the various secretaries and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| Since election day, I guess, I've had two conversations with my successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:55| One involved a couple of positions in the office and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| And the next involved ñ actually, I've had three conversations, another one very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| He dropped in one day, and I gave him a copy of the charter and the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| So he could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| In my second conversation, he told me that he talked about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| And I told him I'd already submitted the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| It was in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| He's certainly welcome to talk to the mayor's office like anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| and to bring it to this body if he wished to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| But he can come and make his case to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| He made his case to the mayor's office, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| But what he told me was that he did want to bring his own secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:58| And I said, well, my budget's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| I certainly don't see the need for that, an additional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| And so I would not be making that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| So he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Just one last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| And this is, again, as I try to understand this, and bless yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| is there a process in general with this hiring freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| You all felt a good thing to have a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| But in general, when you're bringing in employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| and you get these requests from the various departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| do you go out and vet or see if this is a genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| or a needed position to be at in general, not just the law directors in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| Just trying to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| We try to apply some judgment as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| The law director's office is right next door to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| I know they handle a lot of cases, a lot of work, a lot of things that aren't cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| contract work, resolutions, ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| and there's quite a bit of volume that goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| And I didn't think the request was unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I was noticing, oh, I just lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Let Commissioner Pinkston go first while I pull this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| How did you know he's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Commissioner Pinkston, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| John, you said you thought they needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| You don't work in the law department, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| Commissioner McKenzie asked if I tried to apply some judgment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| and I tried to apply some judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| I do work right next door to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I have my own opinion, and I applied my own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| Well, let me ask you this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| We've got a hiring freeze on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| and it looks like we're breaking it for this department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| We didn't say there wouldn't be new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Judge Irwin was thankful for his new referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| There would be new positions, but our proposal included a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| Francis Fogerson has written up some proposed procedures for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| and I don't think that's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And so maybe the new person comes in on January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Well, John, let's get back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I've seen you ask for $600,000 for legal fees, cut down to $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Being no longer than I've been on here, I know we have to have a lot of outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| and I don't believe $350,000 would be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Now, I realize you're leaving, and it probably lets another guy worry about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| but do you think the $350,000 is adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| I don't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| The $350,000 is not adequate this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| It's not adequate next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| We had about the same amount in last year's budget, and, you know, I came back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| what was it, in February, and got another $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| But the conversation I had last year was with John Werner, and John said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| well, let's leave it the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| and understanding full well how much we've spent the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| and that it's going to take between $600,000 and $700,000 for outside legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:29| The legal fees, they have increased, it looks like, by about $113,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:39| They've increased them up from $350,000 or so, an additional $113,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| So you're still going to be a couple hundred thousand dollars short, most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| This time next year, you'll be about $250,000 or so, maybe even $300,000 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| Well, that's what I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| In that line, yeah, in that line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Yes, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| When you took over as law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| were there any shifts or changes in positions from the previous law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| Shifts or changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Any changes in positions, any secretarial changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| No secretarial changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Well, we've had a receptionist, Sarah, who's been with us a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| and she's been learning from the others, and we made her into a full-time secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| I think her salary was $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| And I basically have made her a floater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| So she takes jobs from all the others whenever they're too busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| So she can take projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| But there was a shift there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| A slight shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| A slight shift there, which would have been in the neighborhood of a $10,000 shift as far as money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:16| And then I'm trying to think if we added an attorney after I took office or if that was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:26| I believe it was before, back with, yeah, I'm sure it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Mike Moyers hired another attorney in his last budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| which left us with a total of eight attorneys, including the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| But there was a slight, a small shift in the team, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Prior to being. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| No additional persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| No additional persons, but there was a shift in responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| And prior. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Several others we shifted responsibilities as far as who they worked for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| and on their daily responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Prior to being named law director, what was your employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| In the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| So that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Where did you work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Where did you work in the Knox County Law Director's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I've been in the law director's office for almost 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| And prior to that, I spent two years as a law clerk in the federal court for our federal judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| Prior to that, law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Prior to that, I was a crane operator for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| And I would love to do that again one of these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| I have a question for the mayor's office for Mr. VandeVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Relative to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| We're behind schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| We were ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| We had made up a budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| We're behind now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Mr. Mayor, I have to tell you, I think Mr. Troyer is probably going to be better positioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Now, I think you can handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| This is real easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Now, I know you haven't been with the mayor's office since the beginning of his administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| but you have worked in this courthouse for a number of years in various positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| When the mayor took office, when he first took office for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| did he just continue with the exact same staff that the previous county executive had had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:38| or were there changes in staff, in persons that were brought into his administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| Commissioner, I do believe there was at least one change at the senior management level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| that being at the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| there was also at least one change over the first few months or two at the secretarial level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| But, again, that was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| The point I'm trying to make here that I'm getting to is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| even when there was a slight change, when there was someone promoted within the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| there were some slight shifts within the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| When there was a major change, like when the mayor's administration changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| there were major changes up there, and I think the mayor brought on several new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| Probably about 20 people came in with the mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| If you look at this, having a new law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| I think it's completely justifiable that he's only bringing in one new person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| I think that's completely justifiable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| especially when we use the example of in the mayor's office when there was administrative changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| there were some major changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| And even in the law director's office when there was a promotion, there were some slight changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| So I don't think that one additional employee is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| And I agree with Mr. Troyer that it is reasonable to allow the incoming law director to bring a single person with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| And I think that that's very modest based on what I've seen when other offices change hands in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I had a question about the legal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Why is it zero this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| We moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| That wasn't anything that John asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| They've done some reorganization as far as the accounts go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| Mr. Owens has expressed his concern about having enough funding for outside legal fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| and I understand and hear his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| We also tried to balance that with a tight budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| Okay, let's try to have a number that would be a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| And if it goes above that number, then just like this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| the law director would need to come back before the county commission and say we're running above budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| just like Mr. Owens said would happen, and we'd need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| It's not ideal, but that's the way it's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| So right now you propose a balanced budget, but yet you project that it's not going to be balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| What I'm saying is that I think that we'll try this and see how long it will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| and I think that we're trying to keep the outside legal fees as low as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| and trying to make sure that the county commission stays in tune with the expenses as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| Basically, county commission will be held liable for dipping into other funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| because this is not an accurate portrayal of what you expect in the next coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| No, that's not at all the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| What the case is is that we would like to, we would think we can get by with as low as $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| It could very well be as much as what Mr. Owens says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| and I wanted to recognize that that difference is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| but I wanted to make sure that if there is a change to this, then it would come back before this full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| So you have a difference between legal services and legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| Has that just been a change in method of labeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| What we wanted to do is we knew that there has been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| There has been an issue the last couple of years with a number of cases that required outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| and we wanted to highlight that and make it easier for the commission to see and put it there by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Okay, what about contract with others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Is there a contract with others out of this department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| Which line item is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| As far as our litigation goes, it's court reporter fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| and it's fees related to discovery and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Well, Mr. Law Director, I thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| and thank you for the fair warning to the county commission that this is probably not an accurate portrayal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| You'll be a couple hundred thousand dollars short, I predict, next year, at least that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| Plus you've got an additional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| John Troyer, since you've talked to this new law director that will be coming into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| what's the salary for this person going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:48| The new person, the secretary is what you're talking about, $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| $42,601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| That would be for ten months, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Because they'd come in in September, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Well, what we've done is that we've put in the whole year's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| but we've also included a provision for the hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and so we have in our negative allocation an amount for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| So $42,000 is a full year's salary, but the person would not come on right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| I had a difference of $29,500 for salary and roughly $14,000 for benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:32| $45,000 is what I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| Are you through, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| John Owens, when was the last time you can remember that we got by with $350,000 for outside legal fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:48| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| It's been a long while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| You know, in the last ten years, we've had one attorney in town who has filed, at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| 78 lawsuits against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Those add up, and those really eat into our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| and those have gone a long way to increasing our budget for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:18| The law director's office may as well be in those lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| We may be there and certainly would be unless we were to have a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| but we would be there representing the county or the county commission or the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| or a county official in their official capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| But when persons are sued individually, and attorneys always do, they want your personal pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:43| When they sue you individually, then we end up with a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| So says the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| And so it actually goes back to a case that the city of Knoxville litigated many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| But we have to then hand you off to another attorney or attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| And if they sue several officers, for instance, or several persons within Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| they may have conflicting stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| And so one attorney might not be able to represent all of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| And so, you know, you have to look at each case and decide and make a good judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| as well as look at your conflicts, make sure that you don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Are there any conflicts within the case, within the testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| And do your best to defend everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| And so our budget has increased greatly because of those lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I want to just affirm Mr. Owing's comments about how expensive they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| And that's my thought process also about I think it's important that the county commission stay in tune with these lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| the progress, how much they're costing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| And that's one of the reasons why if the law director would have to come back to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| and ask for more money to have to come back and make a report, here's how it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| here's the cases that are costing us money, here's the cases that cost us less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| And I think this would be a good way for the commission to be involved in this whole process more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:26| Are you through, Commissioner Pinkham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Oh, I believe that's what Mr. Freese just said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| that it's going to fall back on county commission when they come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| And I really don't feel like this is an accurate budget either, John, on this part of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| when we haven't gotten by with that amount of money in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| And you're asking us to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Well, I'm proposing the county commission to be more involved in the lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| and more involved in how much these lawsuits cost us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| I think it's important that the county commission know the cost of these lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| and know the progress as the year goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| If we just go ahead and appropriate the whole amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| then the law director need not report back to the county commission for the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| I think it's better for the law director to come back in midyear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| and if we need it, then there's more money that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Why didn't you just cut it to zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| There's a certain amount that he needs to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| And I don't think that we need to be budgeting for it could be as high as and just pick a high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| I think we need to start with a reasonable number, and if it's more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| then we come back and we talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| We discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| When it comes back, where are we going to get this money, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| There's a couple of different ideas for it, and I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| this year the county commission went to fund balance for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| We don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| But that's what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| That's what I'm afraid this whole budget's been leading up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| That's what I've been saying for the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| We need shorter answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| I think that the secretaries of all elected officials should be equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| I think that there's great disparity in the different packages that they receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| and I would like to see more equality in their packages for the mayor, for the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| for county commission, for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I think it's only fair for those secretaries to receive equitable packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| I think that these discrepancies are not fair, and I don't know how we can go about changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| John Troyer, do you have a way that we could go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Or Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| When you're talking about equity among secretaries in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| that's what we have tried to do over the past several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| is to get everyone pretty much on the same level as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| Most of them, other than my secretary, Jill, who's here, do pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:20| They help their attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| They're each assigned attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| They help them with all of their cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| We have 430 cases or so in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| They, you know, help with their schedules, and plus they do other things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| They each will have an additional responsibility or two, whether it's dealing with property matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| whether it's dealing with maybe a travel related thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| But I'm talking about how could we make, for example, you're an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| or you're in an elected seat and county commission has our secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| and J.J. Jones has his own secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| and so how can we make those secretaries who service the elected officials, the top secretaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| how can we make those equitable packages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| They come in as my secretary is an executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| She came in at a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| I couldn't tell you what the sheriff's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| maybe it should start with the knowledge of what the others receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| but I couldn't tell you what the sheriff's secretary makes or the mayor's secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| Do you have, how can we go about, they're not equitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| how can we go about making them fair and making them equitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| One of the things that we work very, very closely with Francis Fogerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| and Human Resources is to go by the pay and classification system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| which attempts to address Commissioner DeVries' concern, and it's my concern as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| We want to pay the same for same jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| What we've done is tried to categorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| and classify as many employees as we can on a grade and step scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| Not all the officials are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Some officials are, some officials aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| And we have made, I think, in the last several years some very good progress toward equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| but we're not all the way there by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| But I think by staying with the pay and classification study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| and encouraging the officials who are not on the study to join up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| I think that would be steps toward equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| Yeah, John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| I guess we've heard enough about the new employee or new position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| but with term limits and I don't know how many new elected officials will be in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| it seems like we're just trying to get around of letting someone go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| where we're protecting someone's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Because with all the new people that may be coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| we don't know what the election will hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| If a trustee or registrar or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| they need more people to bring in their friends or secretaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| whatever we want to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| What are we going to do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Each office is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| The law director's office, the salaries are included in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Many of the fee offices, their salaries are through a salary suit and not in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Yeah, but let me stop you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| You've asked all elected officials for a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| So if you've got a new trustee that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| are you going to criticize the man if he adds positions, old woman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| What I do know is that the trustee is five positions fewer than he was at this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| So you'd be okay if they add five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I'm not saying that at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| but what I am saying is I do know that it's five positions fewer than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| And the trustee, whoever that may be, will make a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| and that proposal will be something we consider when the proposal is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| And I don't want to speculate on what the trustee, whoever is elected trustee, what they might propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| John, Brother John, you've got an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| It's showing $3,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Is that a real auto allowance or is that pay supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Food or something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| That's a real live auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| It's based upon the ordinance as it was previously written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| which allowed for $3,600 a year, I believe is what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| Yeah, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Mr. Owings, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Do you know how much your contract is with PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| Because all I see is space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Is that what is related to PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| Yeah, that's just their portion of the we allocate space costs based on how much space they have in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| And so Mr. Owings doesn't have any control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| She wants to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| It's on the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| You've got allocated $47,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| $47,117.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| So that would include his share of the utilities and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| and custodial service for this building based on square footage in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Does that include phone service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Phone services and communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Because I noticed in communications you have for last year it had $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:51| Well, close to it, $56,505.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| And then for this year's, actually, you have $19,540.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| And then our year-to-date actual is $27,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| And then you have budgeted again for next year $19,540, when we've already exceeded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| And I would assume that those costs would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Now, does this also include CIT, so this would include technological services, right, with Mr. Moran?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:21| It includes a number of the services that we use, which is PACER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| It's the service that we have to pay for with federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| It includes Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| It includes our cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| There is also a search engine that we use, an investigative search engine that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:44| It's called ChoicePoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| We use that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| So all of those come out of that one account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| Well, I guess I'm just confused because it seems like IT would be an expensive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I could see where you would probably need more than $19,540.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| But my question then becomes, why did you have $56,000 budgeted in 2000 for last year's actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:11| And, I mean, has our communication costs, have the phone expense decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| What's the $40,000 difference or $35,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| I'm not sure I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Our costs there have not decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Our costs there have not decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Well, Mr. Troyer, maybe you can explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Yeah, this is just an example of how hard it is to try to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| And what we have done is we've proposed in the hundreds level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| now the piece that's not in there, year-to-year, the legal services number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| Last year the number was $236,000, and now it's pulled out separately for legal services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| and it's budgeted at $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| So that's an increase of $110,000, $114,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| But year-to-year, outside of that, the numbers are very, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| And that series, that whole 300 series, is about the same as last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| and that's what we're asking the law director to do, is do it on about the same as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| And if he's a little over on communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| then he has to come in at a little less on some of the other series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| and it's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| We have, I'll tell you, as far as our Westlaw service goes to, we've put out for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:34| we've put that out for bid, and hopefully we'll get a little cheaper rate on Westlaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| and we might even have to change to another provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| We might have to go with Lexis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| But we're looking at that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Getting back to the outside cost of these lawsuits, and, Mr. Troyer, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| This body needs to be informed and kept abreast of the cost of that and how they're progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| I think the public needs to know how that is going as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Those are their tax dollars that are being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| But to say that we're going to only spend $350,000 this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| when we've not been at that level for many years is not necessarily trying to budget truthfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:27| because the cost is going to be, Mr. Owens, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| but the cost is going to be whatever that cost is going to be, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| There's not a whole lot of control that we have over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Once you have a situation where you need outside counsel to represent one of our employees or officials, it's turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:54| That defense is turned over to that attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| And you have very little control over that from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| What do you think is a more reasonable amount that we should expect next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| Ultimately, what we spend this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Which will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Because it may even be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| What are we looking at, John, $650,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| We should expect at least another somewhere around $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| And if we don't spend it, then that's money that we have left over that we can put back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Either John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Yeah, if you don't spend money, then it does revert back to the general fund, and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| But I do think we need to be prepared, because if we don't have that budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| then the only place I see if we don't have, I don't know, maybe a line item transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| it comes out of our general fund balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| I mean, that's the only alternatives I know that we have if we exceed the $350,000, if that's what we budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| That's the one we used this year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| I just think we need to try to be, yes, we need to cut where we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| Yes, we need to be frugal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| But I think in areas where we know the cost is going to be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| I think we need to be realistic about what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| John, how many cases do we have that will go into the next budget year that require outside counsel now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| I mean, do you have a figure you could tell us as to how many we have that's ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| that's going to move into the next year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| I don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| It's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| I mean, we have a number of cases that are pending in both state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| and federal court that are monseer cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| Many of his cases have gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| We have, I guess, half a dozen or so in federal court which aren't moving right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:10| Basically everything has been stayed in those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| But we have a number of state court cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| And these cases are not going to go away any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| I mean, you're looking at, knowing the legal process and how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| it's going to be several months before, and then it may not even be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| You'll see a few, Commissioner, you'll see a few that will be dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| or they'll be determined on their merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| But you'll get a few more to come along too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| I guess in the past three weeks we've probably received three or four new complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| not from Mr. Monseer but from other attorneys which have required outside legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| So it's not just getting rid of the ones you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| It's the new ones that come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Where are we on the school situation with regards to the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| that the schools made with the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I know the schools are going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| We said we wanted to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| They're going to look at it at their meeting, maybe tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| At your meeting tonight or it's Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| They're just going to talk about it, Commissioner, as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| And they have, we have an attorney coming in to talk with them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| So right now it's only discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| John, I guess, have you won cases in the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| And if you do, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| We've lost a few too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| But if we win some, do we get to collect attorney fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| Very, very, very, very, very rarely does a defendant ever get to collect fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| In our system of justice, it's really based upon a plaintiff winning their suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| And if they win their suit in certain situations, for instance, with a civil rights lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| they would also get to collect their, be paid for their attorney fees or attorney's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| And so if you had a civil rights lawsuit, for instance, that's filed in federal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| if you won a $30,000 judgment and that judgment was based upon a violation of a civil rights statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| you might have $600,000 in attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| So far, through my administration and the previous two, we have not taken a lick like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:35| If we ever do, the law director, whoever that person may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| will be standing before you asking for money to pay the judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| But we have not been hit with a lick like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Is all your positions filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Well, we have one attorney who has left, and so we have an open attorney's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| Of course, I'll be leaving September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| The 31st of August will be my last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| Mary Ann will be leaving at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| So there will be, I don't intend on filling the attorney's position that I have that's open right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:22| We'll leave that for my successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| John Troyer, is there a way to get a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| Because it's kind of confusing if we have to go through everyone's office to get their space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| Can you give us how much, like a one-page piece of paper, what office it is, how many square feet they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:46| and then the total of what the taxpayers pay for this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| It is possible, and, yes, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you, all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| I'd like to remind our commissioners we were running about 15, 20 minutes ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Now we're 35 minutes behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Forty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| About 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| We moved one up that we've taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Good morning, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Nick McBride, chief deputy, Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| The register had another engagement this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| so I am here to answer any questions you might have of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| You fine with your budget, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Over in the account number 8720, there was a recommendation on 9370 on our travel of $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:44| and we would just ask that that be put back to the $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| That is money that we use or we will be using this next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| We reduced our travel on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| The money in this account comes out of our DP, and we feel that the $6,000 is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6416)|
| 1:47:04| We'll be going out and looking at software, e-recordings, electronic recordings, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:14| Mr. Troyer, can we afford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Part of what we've done, and I agree with Nick here of his need for travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| part of what we've done, though, is we've cut everybody's travel line item just to try to make this budget work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| And so I understand there are valid reasons to go, valid reasons to spend the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| but it's a tight budget, so we need to save where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| And that's why we showed or presented a lower number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner, this account is our DP account, which is $2 per document, and it was set up for computer-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:50| We've already cut our operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| This is our DP account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| It's all that money can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| So it's a fee that's paid by the users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| And then the only use that you have for that fee is the travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Or anything computer-related, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| So, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| What's left can't go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| It can just be saved for travel or something else next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| John, is there any way we can get that shifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| If that's the only money, if that money can only be spent that way, can we get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| Yes, that's exactly correct, and that's exactly the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| What we did is we applied the cuts to travel across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| But given these circumstances, it's a little bit different than other travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| Is there any way we can go ahead and fix that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| I think we can use his funds to pay for his budget line item, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Because we cut our travel on the other side by $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| So we have an overall cut of $6,000 on our budget from last year to this year in travel-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| I appreciate you all doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Mr. Troyer, if you could get that by the time we get to the final budget, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| And, Commissioner, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| I had one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| We have reduced our operating budget and our office expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| and we have been shifting as much of our expenses over into this DP account as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| And if we can go back to the $25,000 that was allocated in the DP account for last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| I know that when the finance department was doing the budget, only $4,000 had been spent at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| and I could see where they would want to pull that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| But I know right now we're at $16,000 or $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| We're moving as much or as many things from our operating budget as we can over into this DP account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| Because if you'll look at the bottom line there, the budget request is $91,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| And we'll bring in almost $200,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| It's all it can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| So toner and things of that nature, we try to bring off our operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| which is funded by the county taxpayers, the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| and we're trying to put as many expenses into this DP account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| And we can make that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Nick, if you all can get with Mr. Troyer and the finance department and work that out, that would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| Nick, I see gasoline on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| Shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Maybe it's the next one down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| You have nothing to do with space cost, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| $131,394.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| That's more than half our operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| And then on top of that is about $8,000 or $9,000 for the telephone system in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| And do you know how many square feet you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| And in addition to that, when Sherry took office January 31st of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| we had 27 full-time employees, and we now have 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| So we're trying to run as lean of an office as we possibly can, because we know it is a tough year for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| And she didn't have to bring in new positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Nick, I just want to compliment you on being the first one to turn your budget into us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| I thought it was first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| We've had it for over a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Sheriff Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:48| Allison Rogers, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| Good news is we're not here to ask for any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| I want to make a couple brief points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| Our total budget increase, $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| $1.6 million of that were for the salary and benefits, the raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| $1.1 million was for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| $700,000 of that $1.1 million was for fuel increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| Our CONTRA account, which is the negative allocation account, went from $575,000 to a negative $915,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:25| which we will have to make up through the year through vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| And then we also had to pick up four positions from a grant that expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| It was for the Focused Alternative Treatment Program grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| I just wanted to make those points before I took any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| Allison, how much negative did you say it was you had to go in for the gas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| It's a $700,000 increase from this past year to the new fiscal year that we're having to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| We asked for more than that, but they did budget $700,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| How much have you been using in the prior years, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| It averages anywhere from $120,000 a month to $135,000 a month for fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| Well, with the $700,000, then, if you're talking about you divide that into 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| you're not talking about that much more a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Really, do you think that's going to be adequate with the way this gas is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| No, sir, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| I don't hardly see how it could be either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| I realize we don't pay tax on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| Mr. Troyer, what do you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Again, this is a tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| We're doing the best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| and I think we hope that gas prices don't stay as high as they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| And it's something that we're just going to have to keep a close eye on because this is a tough year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| Well, what are we going to do if we hit another deficit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| Doesn't that go back to the fund balance like on the law directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Do you have any other ideas where we could get the money from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| If $700,000 additional money for fuel isn't enough, then, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| I think that's something that the county commission needs to be able to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| and I think that would be something that we would talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| and that would be an appropriate place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| So, you know, as we go forward and talk about things like dipping in the fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| it seems to me that there was a federal grant for this focus alternative funding for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| When that grant's over, do we just automatically roll those people over onto the county payrolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| open those programs over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Is that not something that should come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| You know, I'm thinking like with the air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| I mean, I don't see us stepping up if the million dollars doesn't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| We just take those programs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| I'm just trying to understand how those four employees just automatically come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| When the contract is signed by the law director's office, which is brought to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| in that contract it says we are required after the grant expires to pick up those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| for one full budget operating cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| So we are required to pick them up for one full year after the grant expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| And then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| You evaluate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Does that come back before us at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| It would be up to Sheriff Jones whether to keep those employees on or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| But are there somehow categorized in a bin to where if there is a cut that we can say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| well, this program that we had to fund for an additional year, we can do away with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| or do they just kind of blend into the general sheriff's budget and funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| Are you asking at the end of the expiration of that grant, could you cut those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| Is it going to show itself to where if there is, is that going to show itself as a line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| that these focus alternative employees are still under whatever number that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| And we can say, well, we want to do away with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| And I'm just picking that one out of the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| Because things are tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| I mean, there might be, as we've said with fuel and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| there might be an occasion for us to look at some serious cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| And it would be nice if things like that, if that was something that we say, okay, well, it was good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| but we can potentially do without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| So I'm just wondering how it's going to show itself going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| That may be a law director's question because as from what I know on the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| it says we are required to keep those employees for one full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| And that's in the contract that we sign, that the law director signs, that the mayor's office signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| that is a requirement to the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Well, and I guess maybe that's a question for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| And I'm sure it's just not with the sheriff's department, things like EPA and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| Are those, I don't know what you call it, are those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| hooks that come two to three years on down the line, are those clearly explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| are they clearly laid out that, okay, we're going to get this million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| but in 2012 it's going to cost us $300,000 for continuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| As many times as we can, we try to make those hooks as clear as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| before the county commission votes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Because you're exactly right, it's a commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| and we try to spell out just what the county's commitment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| not only for the current budget year but future budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| And your specific question about the four positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| they would be evaluated next year just like a lot of other programs would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7075)|
| 1:58:04| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| Let me just get a fix on the number of employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| How many employees overall does the sheriff's department have in administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| Administration now, if you look at the administration budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| it includes more than just what you would consider, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| administration being the sheriff and chief deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| Are you looking at the salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| Number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| In the administration account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Off the top of my head, I'm going to say 100 to 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| What about deputies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Deputies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| About 435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| And jailers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Right here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| It's probably about 500, 492 to 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| So the total number of employees in the sheriff's office is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| A little over 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Over 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| Now, I checked some justice department numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| The national average is 2.3 sheriff employees per 1,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:18| So that would put us at somewhere around 947 if we were at the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| Would you be willing to engage in a policy of attrition to get us down to the national average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| so we wouldn't be above it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| Commissioner, also, I think that national average, what you're getting at with the justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| also doesn't include prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| If you exclude the jailers, then we're looking at, and if you also look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| you mostly do outside the state limits, we're looking at 642.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| And you add your administrative, and you're still above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| Well, if you want to take away the protection of Knox County, then I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Well, I don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Well, I'm sure the other communities are finding a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I'm just wondering if we can get down to the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| We obviously can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| I'm sure we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| I want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| I really want some numbers and some savings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Now, some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| On page, let's go to page 159 of the online budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:21| There's a $160,000 increase in contracts with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| Can you explain what that increase is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| Can you tell me what account you're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Because my pages are not numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Let me go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| 18960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Page 159 of the online budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| That would be contracts with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| Second line from the top, account number 9360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| 9360 is not one of our accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Are you talking about the corrections budget, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| That would be the corrections budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| What that is is our physician and our dentist and our dental assistant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| this year were budgeted in the salary account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| and finance transferred those dollars into the 9360 contracted services account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| It's not an increase in the overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| It's just reorganizing where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| Also on page 156 in the auxiliary services budget, two things I noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:28| First, that full-time regular pay was more than $60,000 over last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| and also there's a $160,000 increase in part-time seasonal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| also well over last year and year to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| What's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| Why those increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| If you look at the overall number, Commissioner Harmon, it is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| and I believe finance can probably explain that better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| It's just how they budget dollars on the Lawson system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| If you take the whole 100 series of 9110, 9120, 9160, and 9199 together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| the only difference is $1,000, and that's the longevity pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| And on page 159 related to the correctional facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| it's more than $100,000 over current budget on grounds and buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| and I'm wondering what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| Yes, as the commissioners were able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| and visit us at the detention facility a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| they saw the detention facility and what needed to be done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| It's an old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| It's in need of repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| It's in need of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| There's a lot of things to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| That's what we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| That's what we need to keep those buildings out there going and up to ACA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| As I look through the entire budget, there seems to be just several sporadic increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| $12,000 increase office supplies minor on page 133,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| $20,000 more in patrol division over our current budget on equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| $45,000 more in office materials and patrol division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| $10,000 more in detectives on communications and IT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| $10,000 more in office supplies minor in IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| Why are we having these $5,000 more in communications and IT and correctional facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| $14,000 more in office supplies minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Why are we having these rather significant increases during a time of budget crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| If you look at the history of our expenditures over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| you will see that's what we are spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| That's what it takes to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| We're not always funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| Of course, what we need is we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| Because you were over last year, that justifies being over this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| No, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| But on some of those increases that you mentioned, our vest that we need for the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| every five years we have to give them a new vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| That's one of the increases you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| The IT increases are due to air cards where the officers can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Vests are in communications and IT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| The one you mentioned in patrol, the $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| I think you mentioned another $20,000 in 9455.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| That was the equipment, okay, in patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| That explains that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| On the other, the IT-related accounts, those are the air cards that the officers receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| so they are able to do their work out in the field instead of coming back into the office to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| Jail commissary, a $15,000 increase in office supplies minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| What's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| The jail commissary is revenue funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| They fund themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| It's not tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| So why do we need a budget of $15,000 in office supplies minor for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| Let me see where you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| It's page 163.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| Those are for supplies that we purchase to sell to the inmates to make it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| It could be games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| It could be, you know, stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| It could be anything that they want to buy from the commissary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| It's not office supplies for our personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Most of these are just $1,000 increases across the board in various areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to weigh in on the clothing allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| What is the budget for the clothing allowance this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| It's probably, let me look real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| It's probably about $350,000 to $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| If you were to separate it out from the people, the uniformed bodies who need a uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| as opposed to those who can get a suit at American Clothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| or perhaps another article of clothing from Dillard's or Penny's or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| what would the split be from those that need a uniform as opposed to those who get suits and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| Do you want to take the detectives and the administrative staff out of that clothing allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| I'm just asking what is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| What is the difference in terms of the money that the uniformed people would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| as opposed to people who get the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| You're probably talking $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| If you count the detectives which do go to American Clothing or Dillard's to get suits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| if you add those detectives and the admin staff, you're probably looking at saving around $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| If you were to, could you separate that out even further as opposed to the detectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| versus the administrative staff, what would the administrative staff get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| You're looking at administrative staff probably about $7,000 to $8,000 for clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| Mr. Troyer, are there any other departments where we buy suits for people that they go to American Clothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| or are there any other departments that get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| So these people are the only ones who get a clothing allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| You know, in a tight budget year, Alice, I know we could all do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| but I want to commend the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| And, you know, I know people say, well, you've got family members that work there, and I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| But if you, I had an opportunity to look at the city of Knoxville's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| and looking at the KPD budget for their police department, they have just a little over 500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:20| And they have a whole lot less square mileage to cover than the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| And the city police budget is $53 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| And they have no jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Knox County Sheriff's Office has over 1,000 employees, over 1,000 inmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| and your budget is just a little, probably somewhere around $9 million more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| So I think county government is running pretty well efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| And I can tell you in tough budget years, in my mind, schools are number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| law enforcement are number two, and our roads are number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| So, you know, I know we can all tighten the belt some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| but I want to thank you all for what you do because if you look at your budget versus your counterparts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| I think you all do a great deal more because, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| our jails cost us more than $9 million a year probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| First question is about the clothing allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| The city just recently, of course, we had a really high profile law enforcement officer shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| The city just recently started allowing the officers, city officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| to buy an external carrier for their bulletproof vests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Now, as a Portly fellow myself, I have always used the external carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| They're much cooler and much more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| which means that I'm much more likely to wear my vest if I'm riding around with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| Does Knox County currently allow the use of the external carrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| and can they use their clothing allowance to purchase an external carrier for their bulletproof vests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| Well, that's something we're looking at also, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| We don't have that particular type of vest yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| but it is something that our training division is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| Our officers are required by general order to wear their vest when they're on duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| and if they are detective or of that particular position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| then they are to have it readily available by being in their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| As someone who's been with the sheriff's office for a little over 28 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| unfortunately the vest is one piece of equipment that is not comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| and that's a bad word to use, but it is a piece of equipment that is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| It's trying to get officers and anybody to understand of wearing that vest of how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| But we are looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| and it's something that will be available within their clothing allowance if we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| that we will make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| And, again, as a person of size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| I can assure you that that external vest is much, much more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| than the vest that you wear under your clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| I also want to ask about fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| General aviation fuel seems to be going up about as quick, if not quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| at some airports than car gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| The Jet A fuel that you use for the helicopters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| is it going up, and then have you taken that into consideration with your fuel allocations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| What I'm worried about is that with crime going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| that you guys are going to need to fly more sorties in those helicopters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| and I'm just wanting to make sure that you have enough fuel for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| Well, obviously it is going up, just like the gasoline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| But with that in mind, we did not add an increase in our fuel, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| We did not add an increase because we were not exceeding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| So, hopefully, we think with what we budgeted, we think we will be okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| And I also wanted to say that I certainly know that there have been calls from some of the members of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| for you guys to reduce your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| I want to really point out that the members that have said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| predominantly serve in inner city districts, where they get their primary law enforcement from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:29| I want to say, as a person whose district is primarily in the county, in an area where crime is on the rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| I know in my neighborhood we're seeing home invasion crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| We never saw those a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| So I just want to say, please do not reduce your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Please do not reduce your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| The people in my district appreciate the law enforcement coverage that we get from you guys, and you're all they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| I don't think that was a call for myself, but thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| Just very quickly, I wanted to compliment the Sheriff's Office on the trip that they had out to the Maloneyville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| It helped me, in any way, understand some of the unfunded mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| and some of the budgeting difficulties that they have, and also what a good job they're doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| Also, this is for Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| I'm looking at this small book on the county budgeted personnel count in the Sheriff's Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| What I see here is 158 personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| Does that sound like an accurate figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| If that helps him, I just wanted to point him out, 158.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Yes, Chief, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| Talking about the clothing allowance, Mr. Hammond there was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| It would be hard for a detective to go out and get any kind of information in a uniform, wouldn't it, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| Well, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| We require that of our officers also to have at least a coat and tie if they go, whether they're off duty or something, to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| It's either uniform or a coat and tie, and that's why it's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| But if you were coming out to question me about one of my next-door neighbors, I'd probably be a little quiet if I were in uniform, wouldn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| It just also puts some other people maybe a little bit more at ease with an officer being in that type of clothing also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:24| And then another thing, these undercover officers, the drug people and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| they have to buy a lot of clothes that they normally wouldn't buy if they were not in that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| I would think that some of the clothes that you would see, some of them, even if you knew them, they certainly wouldn't be wearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| They wouldn't go to Banana Republic and buy those kind of outfits normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| These people wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| But they have to look like the person that they're investigating or working undercover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Unfortunately, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| I just wanted to let Mr. Hammond know that there are a few things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| I'm very well aware of that, but I also know that some people get $650 to go out and buy suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| There are monies for administrative staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| And I think these are things we need to look at in a tight budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| We don't need any rebuttals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Chief, you hear a lot about the mentally ill in our jails, not only here but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:28| I think we'd all agree if that's your mom or dad or brother or sister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| that they need some kind of mental help that maybe the jail for being picked up for public drunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:39| or some kind of minor offense to be put in our jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| and for us to pay the amount it costs us to incarcerate someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8084)|
| 2:14:51| Working with Helen Ross McNabb, I know that your office and the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| and Helen Ross McNabb have talked about having a different place where people could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8097)|
| 2:15:06| It frees up jail space for the people who need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| but it also would probably bring down some of your costs because of the drugs that they have to be on, medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| And if they're in another facility, maybe some type of other insurance would help pay that cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:23| other than when they come to jail and their insurance coverage with the state or wherever is cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| Have you all gotten any further with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Because I think at the last time Helen Ross McNabb said they needed somewhere around a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| and a half dollars to work with the Sheriff's Department and the Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| and that the city of Knoxville was willing to pay a third of it, so that's probably a half a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| so we're a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| Is that something we could look at in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| and do you think that would reduce some monies that we need in the jails for medication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| Well, obviously it's going to reduce considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| And I may be on the high side, so don't hold me to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| but I think the last time the Sheriff and the General Nichols looked at it in our jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| we looked at about anywhere from 14 to 16 percent of our inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| or probably fall under that category where we could get those people out of our jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| So that would take a lot out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Our psychotropic narcotics, if you will, are probably our most expensive part within the jail side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:26| Those medications cost us more than anything that I can think of right offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| With that being said, taking those out of there, it obviously would reduce some monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| probably a large amount of monies in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| They did go to Nashville, that being Sheriff Jones and General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| I think that was last month or the month before and did talk with the governor about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| They're still waiting on an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| Well, I know there's some legislation that didn't get passed in this session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| but I also heard, and the Attorney General's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| but that they had he thought that there's a way that he could still hold people three to five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| and I don't know if that's charging someone or not charging them for a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| to maybe get this help outside of being arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| And what this does is it releases, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| it doesn't put those people through the court system because, you know, I don't know what the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| but I'm sure it's a very small number of people who return to court that's mentally ill and been picked up for PD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:22| but they clog the court system up with a case that no one shows up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:28| So I think I'd like to ask you all maybe if you could look at it before the budget gets approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:34| and see if there's something that we could help you all with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| because I think, you know, that first it saves us money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| and secondly I think if it's your mom or dad or brother or sister or your cousin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| and they're being picked up for being mentally ill and placed in a jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| that's probably not the best place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| Trustee Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8276)|
| 2:18:18| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Fred Sisk, Knox County Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| Fred, I want to go back to the Rota for Moss report of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| And in that report there was a discussion about comp time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| and adequate time recording and record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| And as I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| it was talking about the fact that there was some comp time that had been accrued 2,654 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:59| One employee had accrued 476 hours of comp time, which was 63 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| It also goes on to talk about the fact that people that worked through their lunch hour got time and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| There was also an issue with the tracking of leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| There was a recommendation of going to a time recording system, a chrono system, as I read it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:25| There was also an issue with annual leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| that apparently there were a couple of instances where policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| I hate to use the word not being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| but they specifically said one employee that had been in the office for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| that had accrued 50 days of annual leave, which was not the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| So I guess my question to you is, how is this comp time being addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| Because this just seems to be excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| One of those employees that accrued the vacation time annual leave was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:05| I've been at the office working, and that time just accrued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| We have an option to either pay or that person can use that time as a vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:18| In essence, what I was doing was I was banking that in case one day there was an illness that I was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| I thought that was a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| Chronos is the timekeeping system that we are now using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| It's used in a couple of other departments across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| It does a very good job with tracking employees' time and vacation, sick time, compensation time, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:46| Why would you have that much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| How many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| In the office, we have a total of 54 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| Okay, 54 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| Then why would you have that much comp time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| I mean, what are you doing that you would have in your office that much comp time over the course of a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| Well, over the course of years, we do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| Primarily, we collect property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| Another thing that we do is we do a lot of accounting work in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| And one of the responsibilities that I had was to oversee what everybody was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| And sometimes it just takes a lot of time when you're double-checking other people's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| I mean, to be accurate and, you know, come here and tell you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| yes, we've collected so many dollars of this and so many dollars of that, you know, you have to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| You know, it's the old theory of, you know, trust but verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| And so we just, you know, accumulate time like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| So you have a lot of people working at night and weekends then because of the comp time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| I guess I'm trying to figure out with that many employees, why would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| I mean, even if you take out the 476, you've still got 2,100 hours of comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| And I'm trying to get a handle on with that many employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| why would people need to be working hours at night or perhaps weekends or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| Sometimes it just does, you know, take people to do that, extra hours to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:09| A lot of what we come in, you know, comes in at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| and then, you know, we close out at the end of the day and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| you're verifying it at the end of the day rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| waiting until the first thing the next morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| You know, we stay caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| Frank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| I think some of the employees that are our outside field auditors that when we're doing a tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:33| and they're trying to go by and physically hand a summons to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:41| and sometimes they're having to catch them after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| And so they spend a lot of time trying to get those delivered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| And that takes a lot of time that you can't necessarily do just during your normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| But you do have the system in place now to accurately track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| and to explain the comp time, why it was used and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| Fred, I see that you've cut your budget by $20,000 from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| And what's the percentage of your tax collection rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| I mean, you do a good job, I think, at collecting what's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| I think we do a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| And one of the things I'm also proud about is our budget over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| And one thing I'd like to tell this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| this is the fourth year in a row that our budget has been less than the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| And so, you know, we have been trying to hold the line, not this year, but in previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| And, you know, that's one item that I'm very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Another item that I'm very proud of is our tax collection rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| Over the past several years, we have met the forecasted collections for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| and we have exceeded those collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| And so, you know, that's something I'm very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| One of the things, you know, that we do is collect property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| And if we don't do our job, then the county is going to suffer somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| You know, if there's a budget shortfall, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| we're going to really do everything that we can to collect every penny that Knox County is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| And so sometimes, you know, just like Craig said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| we have field auditors that are going out and talking to people, you know, and bringing that money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| And so, you know, we have exceeded our collection goal for the past several years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| more than the stated tax roll that is in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| And I'm very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| Yeah, because you collect probably over, what, 100 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| This year, we've already collected over 227 million this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:47| So that's we've done good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| The next one is Kathy Quist, Tim Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| He's not on your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:19| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| I'm Tim Wheeler, Chief Deputy for Ms. Quist, and this is Wendy Norris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| I guess, are you happy with your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Got anything you need changed or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| The only thing that I would request is that if the commission sees fit to appropriate funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| for Judge Irwin's court referee and the additional time that's required for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| that Ms. Quist does get appropriated for the funds to approve a full-time courtroom clerk to support the referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8755)|
| 2:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| You all collect, I guess, you all collect fines or from lawsuits or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| We collect county litigation tax and state litigation tax for every new warrant that is filed either in the circuit court clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8774)|
| 2:26:23| or the General Sessions Court, which is what we call small claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| A lot of people refer to this as the Judge Judy Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| A year ago, September, the state legislator raised our jurisdictional limit from 15 to 25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| and we have seen almost a double increase in just the General Sessions Court in filings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:43| So Knox County has benefited because, and Ann can probably answer easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| but I think it's for every new warrant, $20 is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| And 10 of it was, I think, commission approved about three or four years ago to go to the renovation of the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8814)|
| 2:27:01| and security and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| But you all don't collect, like, fines or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| There are no fines collected in our court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| That all lies in Criminal Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| And you all get your money, I guess, at the time of filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| The clerk gets a set amount by annotated code, what the state legislature sets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| and that is how then Ms. Quist pays her employees out of the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| I'm going to ask you, I believe I can ask you about items from the circuit clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| and the civil sessions clerk office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Are those both under your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| Yes, sir, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| I'm looking at page four and five of the online budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:46| $15,000 in office supplies minor when last year was budgeted at $13,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| Actual was only $6,300, and year to date has only been about $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| Why this rather dramatic increase in office supplies minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| Well, a lot of that has to do with the fluctuation of the court and the filings that are in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:08| When the economy tanks, obviously more lawsuits get filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| and everybody knows, I think, what our economy is doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| So it's really hard to project out because of our offices basically generate on what is filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| Also in your budget, there's a nearly $9,000 jump in workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| Have you had a filing, a problem, an insurance increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| What's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| On that, I probably would have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| We did have one employee who fell in the courthouse and had to go to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:53| Let me just talk a little bit about workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| What we do is we try to budget that, at least for the general county side of it, in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8935)|
| 2:29:02| and then we apply our total expectations to actual experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8942)|
