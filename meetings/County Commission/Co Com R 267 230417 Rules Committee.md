|  246.02 |  247.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=246.02)             |
|  247.02 |  256.02 | Can we incorporate some verbiage where the work session agenda has a caption                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=247.02)             |
|  256.02 |  263.02 | that we always bring under discussion that always includes the agenda items?                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=256.02)             |
|  263.02 |  268.02 | So each month we don't have to say, Madam Chair,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=263.02)             |
|  268.02 |  275.02 | we'd like to have for a discussion item zoning items 51 through 73.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=268.02)             |
|  275.02 |  281.02 | We can just have an automatic caption on the work session agenda that just                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=275.02)             |
|  282.02 |  288.02 | says discussion zoning issues or zoning items.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=282.02)             |
|  288.02 |  291.02 | I'll look to the law director.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=288.02)             |
|  291.02 |  294.02 | Yeah, I mean, that's just a matter of how you set your agenda.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=291.02)             |
|  294.02 |  296.02 | I think we did that last month.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=294.02)             |
|  296.02 |  297.02 | We did.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=296.02)             |
|  297.02 |  299.02 | Very similar to that.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=297.02)             |
|  299.02 |  305.02 | The thing that's important, and I think it's certainly strongly implied in here                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=299.02)             |
|  305.02 |  309.02 | by the language that says that it's informational purposes                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=305.02)             |
|  309.02 |  312.02 | and for the purpose of setting the commission agenda only                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=309.02)             |
|  312.02 |  314.02 | and not for recommendation for the commission agenda.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=312.02)             |
|  314.02 |  318.02 | If you want to make that a little clearer, you could insert a sentence there                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=314.02)             |
|  318.02 |  324.02 | that no vote on any zoning matter shall be taken at the work session,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=318.02)             |
|  324.02 |  329.02 | just to make it really clear that that's discussion only and no votes to be taken.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=324.02)             |
|  329.02 |  333.02 | As far as the rest, that's just a matter of how you set your agenda,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=329.02)             |
|  333.02 |  337.02 | if you wish to have that on there.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=333.02)             |
|  337.02 |  338.02 | How did we do that last time?                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=337.02)             |
|  338.02 |  343.02 | Didn't we have it as a discussion item, and it just said items number,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=338.02)             |
|  343.02 |  346.02 | like I said, 51 through 73.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=343.02)             |
|  346.02 |  351.02 | But what we need to do then is just have that as a standardization                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=346.02)             |
|  351.02 |  354.02 | of the work session agenda that there's a discussion item                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=351.02)             |
|  354.02 |  356.02 | and it just lists the numbers.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=354.02)             |
|  356.02 |  362.02 | Well, when you have here under Roman numeral two, zonings,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=356.02)             |
|  362.02 |  368.02 | you could just have zoning request discussion or something like that,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=362.02)             |
|  368.02 |  375.02 | and then they would automatically be available for discussion but not vote.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=368.02)             |
|  375.02 |  378.02 | That's just the not voting part is the important part.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=375.02)             |
|  378.02 |  379.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=378.02)             |
|  379.02 |  382.02 | So Drew can handle that internally then.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=379.02)             |
|  382.02 |  385.02 | We don't need a formal rule.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=382.02)             |
|  385.02 |  388.02 | Not on the agenda.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=385.02)             |
|  388.02 |  391.02 | Whether you want to add something to section N that makes it clear                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=388.02)             |
|  391.02 |  395.02 | that there's no votes to be taken on zoning matters is up to you.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=391.02)             |
|  395.02 |  401.02 | I mean, we've been good about that since we pointed it out.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=395.02)             |
|  401.02 |  407.02 | So that would not have to have a vote on that, change the rule or add addition?                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=401.02)             |
|  407.02 |  411.02 | Well, again, it's how you're setting your agenda.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=407.02)             |
|  411.02 |  415.02 | I don't think there's any rule that talks about that                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=411.02)             |
|  415.02 |  419.02 | if you just want to make that a regular discussion item.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=415.02)             |
|  419.02 |  425.02 | And then as far as, you know, the sentence I've proposed, that's just up to you.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=419.02)             |
|  425.02 |  427.02 | Like I said, when you read it, it says it's for informational purposes,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=425.02)             |
|  427.02 |  429.02 | for the setting of the agenda only                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=427.02)             |
|  429.02 |  431.02 | and not for recommendation for the commission agenda.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=429.02)             |
|  431.02 |  433.02 | To me, that says no vote.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=431.02)             |
|  433.02 |  437.02 | So, I mean, I think it's already there.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=433.02)             |
|  437.02 |  440.02 | You could make it more explicit by saying no vote shall be taken.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=437.02)             |
|  440.02 |  446.02 | Yeah, I would like to include that if we can, that no vote will be taken.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=440.02)             |

|  456.02 |  458.02 | Well, you need to get closer.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=456.02)             |
|  458.02 |  460.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=458.02)             |
|  460.02 |  464.02 | I think you could just two-fold in the language say,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=460.02)             |
|  464.02 |  466.02 | you could just change this line.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=464.02)             |
|  466.02 |  471.02 | The zoning request should be listed on the agenda of the agenda.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=466.02)             |
|  471.02 |  475.02 | I think you could probably just say of the agenda of the work session                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=471.02)             |
|  475.02 |  479.02 | for informational purposes and for the purposes of setting the commission zoning,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=475.02)             |
|  479.02 |  483.02 | and will also be included as a discussion item and no vote.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=479.02)             |
|  483.02 |  487.02 | So, I think you could just change the language to say it will be a discussion item.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=483.02)             |
|  487.02 |  492.02 | All zonings will be listed as a discussion item and no votes will be taken.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=487.02)             |

|  493.02 |  494.02 | You guys give us your intent.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=493.02)             |
|  494.02 |  496.02 | We'll put it into.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=494.02)             |
|  496.02 |  498.02 | That would seem to clarify both.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=496.02)             |
|  498.02 |  504.02 | Yep.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=498.02)             |
|  505.02 |  509.02 | Madam Chair, you got to recognize you.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=505.02000000000004) |

|  511.02 |  520.02 | Something that we had talked about previously was the fact to make sure that even though we're not voting,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=511.02000000000004) |
|  520.02 |  524.02 | not saying I will support this or I don't support this.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=520.02)             |
|  524.02 |  530.02 | I mean, technically, that's still saying how we will vote,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=524.02)             |
|  530.02 |  532.02 | even though we're not technically taking a vote.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=530.02)             |
|  532.02 |  538.02 | So, I guess it's just as long as we stay away from that type of language, right?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=532.02)             |
|  538.02 |  539.02 | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=538.02)             |
|  539.02 |  546.02 | There's times in the discussion where I heard I'm not in favor of this or something like that.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=539.02)             |
|  546.02 |  548.02 | To me, that's telling you how you're going to.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=546.02)             |
|  548.02 |  549.02 | We got to watch our language.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=548.02)             |
|  549.02 |  551.02 | I agree with you.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=549.02)             |
|  551.02 |  553.02 | We have to watch our language.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=551.02)             |
|  553.02 |  555.02 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=553.02)             |
|  555.02 |  556.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=555.02)             |
|  556.02 |  563.02 | But we're in a publicly called meeting where we're having discussions.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=556.02)             |
|  563.02 |  571.02 | So, if you had a regular agenda item, you could say I'm in favor of that, I'm not in favor of that, if it was something.                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=563.02)             |
|  571.02 |  574.02 | So, on a discussion item with a publicly called meeting,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=571.02)             |
|  574.02 |  582.02 | why can't the sitting commissioner for that zoning issue say I'm in favor of this, I'm not in favor of this,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=574.02)             |
|  582.02 |  590.02 | so at least we understand what's going on and then can do additional due diligence in the following week?                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=582.02)             |
|  590.02 |  601.02 | Well, my first thought is that if I have one in District 9 and I've not spoken to someone,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=590.02)             |
|  601.02 |  606.02 | but I've got a feeling that I don't want it because it's too many, too many units per acre or whatever,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=601.02)             |
|  606.02 |  612.02 | and I say, well, I'm not, I don't really in favor of this because of too many units per acre.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=606.02)             |
|  612.02 |  615.02 | They're not there to defend themselves.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=612.02)             |
|  615.02 |  619.02 | You're just giving an opinion to the 11 members of the board.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=615.02)             |
|  619.02 |  621.02 | I understand.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=619.02)             |
|  621.02 |  626.02 | I think we're treading on Mr. Law Director.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=621.02)             |
|  626.02 |  631.02 | These matters are supposed to be looked at publicly, and this is a public meeting.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=626.02)             |
|  631.02 |  637.02 | The problem is if we start discussing or making recommendations either for or against                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=631.02)             |
|  637.02 |  645.02 | or expressing our opinions either for or against, I think your point is correct.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=637.02)             |
|  645.02 |  654.02 | People who have an interest may wish to be here, and they may wish to be heard if we're discussing their items.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=645.02)             |
|  654.02 |  657.02 | I think if we're going to do this, and I know for a very long time we didn't do this,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=654.02)             |
|  657.02 |  664.02 | I think if we're going to do this, the best possible use is just to have sort of a report about what it's about.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=657.02)             |
|  664.02 |  665.02 | Okay?                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=664.02)             |
|  665.02 |  671.02 | This is a rezoning, the recommendation from staff is X, the recommendation, for anybody who wants to say,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=665.02)             |
|  671.02 |  680.02 | but to start expressing our opinions for or against is trotting a fairly difficult line, I think,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=671.02)             |
|  680.02 |  684.02 | when you're talking about somebody's project and whether they're here or not.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=680.02)             |
|  684.02 |  687.02 | This is why we do all the public notice for people for the regular meetings.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=684.02)             |
|  687.02 |  693.02 | I mean, beyond just we're meeting in session, when there are zoning items, they, you know,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=687.02)             |
|  693.02 |  696.02 | signs are put up and stuff to tell people when and where to be there.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=693.02)             |
|  696.02 |  701.02 | So it's probably best that those things aren't really debated even to the extent of saying,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=696.02)             |
|  701.02 |  705.02 | well, I'm for this or I'm against this.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=701.02)             |
|  705.02 |  707.02 | It would be better if that were not done.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=705.02)             |
|  707.02 |  714.02 | I don't know how you articulate a rule, and I hate to put down a rule that says a commissioner can't say X, Y, or Z,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=707.02)             |
|  714.02 |  718.02 | but I think it's bad practice.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=714.02)             |
|  718.02 |  720.02 | Commissioner Hill.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=718.02)             |
|  720.02 |  723.02 | Thank you, Commissioner Daley.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=720.02)             |
|  723.02 |  728.02 | I tend to agree with what's been said.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=723.02)             |
|  728.02 |  733.02 | I do think, though, that Commissioner Schoonmaker made a very good point.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=728.02)             |
|  733.02 |  743.02 | When we are discussing other matters during work session, many times we will say, well, I can't support this                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=733.02)             |
|  743.02 |  751.02 | or I do support this, and we don't necessarily at that point stop and let anyone speak to it.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=743.02)             |
|  751.02 |  755.02 | So, I mean, we're doing that anyway.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=751.02)             |
|  755.02 |  759.02 | I have no problem with what you've suggested about information only.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=755.02)             |
|  759.02 |  769.02 | I'm just cautioning us that this is a practice we already follow.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=759.02)             |
|  769.02 |  770.02 | I agree.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=769.02)             |
|  770.02 |  771.02 | You know, I can see both sides.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=770.02)             |
|  771.02 |  772.02 | I really do.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=771.02)             |
|  772.02 |  775.02 | But I can imagine.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=772.02)             |
|  775.02 |  777.02 | I'm the guy that looks out there.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=775.02)             |
|  777.02 |  782.02 | I can imagine that there's somebody standing in there two weeks from now after we discussed it,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=777.02)             |
|  783.02 |  789.02 | and they lose and we're sued in court because they were not there to defend,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=783.02)             |
|  789.02 |  791.02 | and they'll sue for anything.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=789.02)             |
|  791.02 |  793.02 | So I'm just trying to err.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=791.02)             |
|  793.02 |  796.02 | I see Mr. Law Director.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=793.02)             |
|  796.02 |  800.02 | I agree with the proposition.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=796.02)             |
|  800.02 |  807.02 | This is not just something that's on the agenda that the mayor has suggested or one of the commissioners.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=800.02)             |
|  807.02 |  814.02 | This is an applicant that is wanting this body to do a rezoning.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=807.02)             |
|  814.02 |  817.02 | And I speak to you now not as a law director,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=814.02)             |
|  817.02 |  823.02 | but I come to you because I spent 30 years on the other side of that fence.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=817.02)             |
|  823.02 |  826.02 | And I knew when I came in at the time I had to come in                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=823.02)             |
|  826.02 |  832.02 | and address the county commission was at the meeting.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=826.02)             |
|  832.02 |  833.02 | That's what was noticed.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=832.02)             |
|  833.02 |  836.02 | That's what the neighbors were noticed with the signs.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=833.02)             |
|  836.02 |  838.02 | And that's when I think the decision was going to be made.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=836.02)             |
|  838.02 |  841.02 | Now, if I'm on that other side                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=838.02)             |
|  841.02 |  848.02 | and the decisions are talked about and made in a discussion session that I'm not being ñ                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=841.02)             |
|  848.02 |  850.02 | I mean, I know the public notice goes out,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=848.02)             |
|  850.02 |  857.02 | but nobody, applicants don't appear at that work session meeting because they don't have to.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=850.02)             |
|  857.02 |  859.02 | And I think it's a due process issue.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=857.02)             |
|  859.02 |  865.02 | And I certainly, if they made a decision in a discussion matter at a work session                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=859.02)             |
|  865.02 |  870.02 | that I wasn't there and not noticed that I needed to be there to defend my position,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=865.02)             |
|  870.02 |  877.02 | I would take that to court as being a violation of my due process rights as a property owner.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=870.02)             |
|  877.02 |  885.02 | So I think what Mr. Moyers has said is tread very, very cautiously on that.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=877.02)             |
|  885.02 |  889.02 | Well, I think that all 11 of us,                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=885.02)             |
|  890.02 |  895.02 | or yeah, all 11 because at large can discuss the zoning item too,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=890.02)             |
|  895.02 |  903.02 | that we be careful that we don't lead someone into a direction for the following Monday's vote.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=895.02)             |

|  978.02 |  986.02 | I pulled that one, but I'm going to give that one to our law director to explain that we might be trading on some water there.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=978.02)             |
|  986.02 |  987.02 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=986.02)             |
|  987.02 |  992.02 | To go back to what we discussed at the commission retreat,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=987.02)             |
|  992.02 |  997.02 | the reason we have the education consent calendar arises out of the litigation that happened between the school board                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=992.02)             |
|  997.02 | 1004.02 | and the county back in 2000, 2001, whenever it was.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=997.02)             |
| 1004.02 | 1010.02 | And what came out of that was the fact is, and this applies really to every county,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1004.02)            |
| 1010.02 | 1013.02 | the authority of the county commission is to set the overall budget of the commission                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1010.02)            |
| 1013.02 | 1020.02 | and to set the broad budgetary categories for the school board.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1013.02)            |
| 1020.02 | 1028.02 | But after that, the school board is empowered by state law to spend its money however it sees fit.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1020.02)            |
| 1028.02 | 1034.02 | So what was happening before and one of the things that led to the litigation was the county commissions,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1028.02)            |
| 1034.02 | 1039.02 | the old commission, the 19-member commission would have these education meetings and finance meetings                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1034.02)            |
| 1039.02 | 1043.02 | and they would bring the school people down here and grill them about every matter                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1039.02)            |
| 1043.02 | 1048.02 | and they would regularly turn down things that they really had no authority to turn down.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1043.02)            |
| 1048.02 | 1055.02 | And so one of the things that came out of that litigation was the education consent calendar.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1048.02)            |
| 1055.02 | 1062.02 | The reason we have it is because our county charter says that the commission must approve all contracts over a certain level.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1055.02)            |
| 1062.02 | 1064.02 | I think in the charter it's 50.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1062.02)            |
| 1064.02 | 1069.02 | I think we may have raised it to 100 by ordinance at some point.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1064.02)            |
| 1069.02 | 1076.02 | But in any event, the commission has to sign off and the county mayor has to sign off on every contract.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1069.02)            |
| 1076.02 | 1084.02 | So to make these two things work together, we created the education consent calendar.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1076.02)            |
| 1084.02 | 1092.02 | The commission's approval of school budgetary items is basically intended to be a very pro forma matter                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1084.02)            |
| 1092.02 | 1095.02 | to comply with the provisions of the charter.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1092.02)            |
| 1095.02 | 1101.02 | It's not intended to be something where we get engaged in deep discussions.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1095.02)            |
| 1101.02 | 1104.02 | Again, I know the commission likes to know what's going on                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1101.02)            |
| 1104.02 | 1112.02 | and I don't think that the outcome of the litigation prohibits you from discussing matters that are on the education consent agenda,                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1104.02)            |
| 1112.02 | 1116.02 | although I think most of the time it's ill-advised.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1112.02)            |
| 1116.02 | 1120.02 | But it's not prohibited.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1116.02)            |
| 1120.02 | 1125.02 | But what is prohibited is turning down items that are on that agenda.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1120.02)            |
| 1125.02 | 1134.02 | We have no authority to tell the school board they cannot use the money that we've granted them to sign a contract,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1125.02)            |
| 1134.02 | 1136.02 | whether we agree with it or not.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1134.02)            |
| 1136.02 | 1145.02 | And so I have noticed that from time to time matters are being taken off of the education consent agenda                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1136.02)            |
| 1145.02 | 1148.02 | for the purpose of discussion at the workshop meeting.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1145.02)            |
| 1148.02 | 1154.02 | My concern is if you follow your normal process, you would then vote for a recommendation.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1148.02)            |
| 1154.02 | 1161.02 | What I'm suggesting is that we use language somewhat similar to the zoning language that we were just talking about                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1154.02)            |
| 1161.02 | 1170.02 | and say that if a matter is pulled for discussion from the education consent agenda, it will be re-added.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1161.02)            |
| 1170.02 | 1171.02 | There will be no vote taken.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1170.02)            |
| 1171.02 | 1175.02 | It's for discussion and informational purposes only, and it will be re-added.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1171.02)            |
| 1175.02 | 1178.02 | And Jill's got some language, I think, that will accomplish that.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1175.02)            |
| 1178.02 | 1183.02 | Jill, do you want to read that in?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1178.02)            |
| 1183.02 | 1189.02 | To just add a sentence that says any item on the education consent calendar that's pulled for discussion at the work session                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1183.02)            |
| 1189.02 | 1194.02 | shall remain on the education consent calendar for the commission meeting.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1189.02)            |
| 1194.02 | 1200.02 | And that would make it just explicit that we're not voting, you know,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1194.02)            |
| 1200.02 | 1207.02 | because my concern would be if one person passes or votes no, then it doesn't go on education consent.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1200.02)            |
| 1207.02 | 1209.02 | Then we're having a full discussion and vote at commission.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1207.02)            |
| 1210.02 | 1216.02 | And that violates the court order that resulted from that litigation all those years ago                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1210.02)            |
| 1216.02 | 1220.02 | and that we're still under, and they're still under, which is what we want.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1216.02)            |
| 1220.02 | 1226.02 | It's kept peace for the last 20 years, which is a good thing.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1220.02)            |
| 1226.02 | 1228.02 | Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1226.02)            |
| 1228.02 | 1235.02 | So in other words, for the work session agenda, if the chair, somebody wants to pull number 15                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1228.02)            |
| 1235.02 | 1241.02 | that's under the education consent, the chair would say we're pulling item number 15 to discuss                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1235.02)            |
| 1241.02 | 1244.02 | but would not ask for a motion and a second.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1241.02)            |
| 1244.02 | 1245.02 | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1244.02)            |
| 1245.02 | 1247.02 | So that's the procedure of the chair.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1245.02)            |
| 1247.02 | 1248.02 | Right.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1247.02)            |
| 1248.02 | 1251.02 | If there's a discussion, you know, you can ask questions, whatever, try to get them answered.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1248.02)            |
| 1251.02 | 1255.02 | But at the end of the discussion, anything, just like a zoning matter, is there anything else?                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1251.02)            |
| 1255.02 | 1257.02 | Then you go on to the next item.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1255.02)            |
| 1257.02 | 1261.02 | No vote to be taken.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1257.02)            |
| 1261.02 | 1263.02 | Anyone else?                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1261.02)            |
| 1263.02 | 1274.02 | If I pull school consent, school calendar item 12, and they say, well, I'll have to get back with you next week.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1263.02)            |
| 1274.02 | 1277.02 | It's really not on consent, but it's on consent.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1274.02)            |
| 1277.02 | 1279.02 | So we still take it the same way?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1277.02)            |
| 1279.02 | 1286.02 | It's on consent because, again, if you pull it off, let's say we had an item tonight on the consent agenda,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1279.02)            |
| 1286.02 | 1290.02 | and you say, well, I'd like to hear from the superintendent on this matter.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1286.02)            |
| 1290.02 | 1293.02 | The superintendent isn't here.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1290.02)            |
| 1293.02 | 1298.02 | It's still on consent because the fact is you don't have the right to say no.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1293.02)            |
| 1298.02 | 1305.02 | The only reason these are even on your agenda at all is because of the charter provision that says commission must approve all contracts                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1298.02)            |
| 1305.02 | 1313.02 | over a certain amount and that the county mayor has to sign off on all contracts in the name of Knox County.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1305.02)            |
| 1313.02 | 1318.02 | So we've got some state law that mandate one thing.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1313.02)            |
| 1318.02 | 1321.02 | We've got some charter provisions that mandate another thing.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1318.02)            |
| 1321.02 | 1325.02 | What came out of that litigation was how do we harmonize these things?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1321.02)            |
| 1325.02 | 1330.02 | We don't want to say that one overrules the other where we don't have to.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1325.02)            |
| 1330.02 | 1337.02 | And so what came out of that was, okay, it goes on the commission agenda for approval because that's what the charter says,                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1330.02)            |
| 1337.02 | 1342.02 | but because we have no right to say no, it goes on the consent agenda.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1337.02)            |
| 1342.02 | 1347.02 | And so pulling it off, I mean, it's for your own curiosity, frankly,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1342.02)            |
| 1347.02 | 1351.02 | because at the end of the day you don't have any legal authority to say no.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1347.02)            |
| 1351.02 | 1354.02 | There's almost no reason even to pull one off the agenda.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1351.02)            |
| 1354.02 | 1358.02 | If you have a question about it, it's just as easy to pick up the phone and call John Riseman.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1354.02)            |
| 1358.02 | 1373.02 | A full commission agenda of an item that you can't say no to is, say, a waste of time, but you have no choice but to say yes.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1358.02)            |
| 1373.02 | 1380.02 | I understand, and the Carnes, I'll give you a good example that something that needed to be discussed                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1373.02)            |
| 1380.02 | 1387.02 | was the Carnes Culinary Building that money was approved for it and never paid,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1380.02)            |
| 1387.02 | 1393.02 | and it kind of was going to be snuck under, and it was pulled out, and we found out we had to,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1387.02)            |
| 1393.02 | 1400.02 | they used the money that was supposed to went to the building to build a culinary part of the Carnes High School.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1393.02)            |
| 1400.02 | 1404.02 | They used it for something else, and so they had to come and get more money.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1400.02)            |
| 1404.02 | 1406.02 | So that needed to be brought out.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1404.02)            |
| 1406.02 | 1410.02 | Yeah, I mean, if they move money, and I don't know the circumstance you're talking about,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1406.02)            |
| 1410.02 | 1414.02 | if they move money between budgetary categories, they have to have authority for that.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1410.02)            |
| 1414.02 | 1417.02 | Okay, so if you give them a million dollars for capital improvements                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1414.02)            |
| 1417.02 | 1420.02 | and they decide to take that million dollars and put it in teacher salaries,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1417.02)            |
| 1420.02 | 1424.02 | that's something they would have to come back and ask for authority to do.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1420.02)            |
| 1425.02 | 1430.02 | But if they ask for a million dollars in budgetary authority for capital improvements                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1425.02)            |
| 1430.02 | 1433.02 | and you think they're going to spend it on Carnes and spend it on Powell,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1430.02)            |
| 1433.02 | 1439.02 | that's within their authority to do, and I don't think the commission can say no to that.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1433.02)            |
| 1439.02 | 1442.02 | All right, Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1439.02)            |
| 1442.02 | 1448.02 | Would it best serve us if we just add on the agenda discussion of education consent?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1442.02)            |
| 1448.02 | 1456.02 | Well, Jill has got a—I think Jill solved the problem here.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1448.02)            |
| 1456.02 | 1459.02 | The language that Jill read in a minute ago takes care of the problem.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1456.02)            |
| 1459.02 | 1463.02 | I think if you add an agenda item for discussion of education consent items,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1459.02)            |
| 1463.02 | 1467.02 | it almost encourages people to discuss all these things.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1463.02)            |
| 1467.02 | 1472.02 | In most cases, unless there's something that's really, really screwy looking,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1467.02)            |
| 1472.02 | 1478.02 | there should not be any need to discuss because that's what we have a school board for.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1472.02)            |
| 1478.02 | 1483.02 | They make these decisions within the budgetary authority given by the commission.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1478.02)            |
| 1483.02 | 1489.02 | That's how these two bodies interact.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1483.02)            |
| 1489.02 | 1491.02 | Just a brief comment.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1489.02)            |
| 1491.02 | 1495.02 | I, two or three times, have asked to have things pulled,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1491.02)            |
| 1495.02 | 1500.02 | but it's been because I've been so excited about it                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1495.02)            |

| 1648.02 | 1661.02 | My concern is that the chair that can appoint or say an ad hoc or say a special committee is formed,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1648.02)            |
| 1661.02 | 1667.02 | and the chair, a strong chair, I mean a really strong chair,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1661.02)            |
| 1667.02 | 1672.02 | can get enough members on that board to where they are elected chair,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1667.02)            |
| 1672.02 | 1677.02 | where then that chair, as chair, they guide the whole discussion.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1672.02)            |
| 1677.02 | 1686.02 | So I don't, for the future, not, for the future of us 11 or the future 11,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1677.02)            |
| 1686.02 | 1690.02 | that the chair of Knox County Commission should not, in my opinion,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1686.02)            |
| 1690.02 | 1702.02 | serve as chair on any boards or committees except for the ones that are listed in the Knox ID board and all that.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1690.02)            |
| 1702.02 | 1704.02 | Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1702.02)            |
| 1704.02 | 1705.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chairman.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1704.02)            |
| 1705.02 | 1708.02 | So this would be effective September 1st of 23?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1705.02)            |
| 1708.02 | 1709.02 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1708.02)            |
| 1709.02 | 1711.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1709.02)            |
| 1711.02 | 1716.02 | And anybody, Madam Chair is the chair of the personnel committee.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1711.02)            |
| 1716.02 | 1725.02 | As long as personnel committee, I don't know, is this an ongoing committee, Madam Chair?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1716.02)            |
| 1725.02 | 1732.02 | Until there's another election, Madam Chair will serve as chair of that until another election, if this passes.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1725.02)            |
| 1732.02 | 1734.02 | That's not the case.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1732.02)            |
| 1734.02 | 1738.02 | The chair is a member of the personnel committee,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1734.02)            |
| 1738.02 | 1746.02 | and so if I were to not be chair come September 1st, I would not be on the committee.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1738.02)            |
| 1746.02 | 1755.02 | The four other members serve for two-year terms, and the chair serves as long as they're chair.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1746.02)            |
| 1755.02 | 1757.02 | As their term.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1755.02)            |
| 1757.02 | 1759.02 | Their term as chair.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1757.02)            |
| 1759.02 | 1762.02 | Well, then September 1st, that would take care of.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1759.02)            |
| 1762.02 | 1769.02 | We put in the language that Knox County chair cannot serve as chair on any committee or board.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1762.02)            |
| 1769.02 | 1777.02 | That will take care of it as if unless you are re-elected as chair.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1769.02)            |
| 1777.02 | 1780.02 | Make sense to everybody?                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1777.02)            |
| 1780.02 | 1782.02 | No?                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1780.02)            |
| 1782.02 | 1784.02 | So you're saying?                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1782.02)            |
| 1784.02 | 1787.02 | Hold on just a second.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1784.02)            |
| 1787.02 | 1790.02 | I'm trying to follow Robertson's orders myself.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1787.02)            |
| 1790.02 | 1792.02 | Mr. Frazier, your light's on.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1790.02)            |
| 1792.02 | 1793.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1792.02)            |
| 1793.02 | 1796.02 | I just had a question for anyone who served as chair previously.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1793.02)            |
| 1796.02 | 1799.02 | I know Commissioner Jay has served as chair.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1796.02)            |
| 1799.02 | 1809.02 | Did you serve on any boards, Commissioner Jay, where you were the chair or committees where you were the chair as well?                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1799.02)            |
| 1809.02 | 1812.02 | I'm trying to figure out what problem are we trying to solve.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1809.02)            |
| 1812.02 | 1819.02 | Has it created an issue or concern in the past?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1812.02)            |
| 1819.02 | 1824.02 | I'm trying to just think.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1819.02)            |
| 1824.02 | 1831.02 | I had a special called committee, but that was a temporary special called committee, so it wasn't a standing.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1824.02)            |
| 1831.02 | 1840.02 | I mean, it wasn't a committee that would last in perpetuity like the personnel committee or other committees standing or otherwise.                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1831.02)            |
| 1841.02 | 1848.02 | And then external boards, IDB, NOxED, things like that, that wouldn't be the case.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1841.02)            |
| 1848.02 | 1852.02 | So I don't think that's the case.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1848.02)            |
| 1852.02 | 1861.02 | I think the intention of where Commissioner Daley is coming from is we've added a new committee that is a personnel.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1852.02)            |
| 1861.02 | 1869.02 | I mean, the personnel committee is, I've never heard of it as being temporary.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1861.02)            |
| 1869.02 | 1872.02 | You know, there's standing and then there's non-standing.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1869.02)            |
| 1872.02 | 1877.02 | And it was formed, but it wasn't formed as like a standing committee.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1872.02)            |
| 1877.02 | 1879.02 | It was formed as a non-standing committee.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1877.02)            |
| 1879.02 | 1884.02 | And so it's sort of over here by itself where I'm not exactly sure that happened.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1879.02)            |
| 1884.02 | 1887.02 | I can't remember the discussion and the circumstances.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1884.02)            |
| 1887.02 | 1889.02 | Maybe that could be filled in.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1887.02)            |
| 1889.02 | 1900.02 | I think if I understand Commissioner Daley's concern is that we've got sort of a permanent committee that is not under the rules of every other committee, | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1889.02)            |
| 1900.02 | 1907.02 | which would not allow the chair to be both the chair of commission and the chair of a regular committee order.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1900.02)            |
| 1907.02 | 1908.02 | Is that accurate?                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1907.02)            |
| 1908.02 | 1909.02 | Accurate.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1908.02)            |
| 1909.02 | 1914.02 | But I wasn't, when I was chair, I was not chair of any other committee.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1909.02)            |
| 1914.02 | 1921.02 | In fact, when it came around, somebody nominated me for something to chair, and we all said, no, no, I can't do it.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1914.02)            |
| 1921.02 | 1924.02 | So I think the issue is we just have this outlier.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1921.02)            |
| 1924.02 | 1932.02 | So I guess the question I would say is why, does anybody remember the discussion of why the personnel committee was not set up as a standing committee,    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1924.02)            |
| 1932.02 | 1935.02 | which is like finance committee and all these other ones?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1932.02)            |
| 1935.02 | 1940.02 | I would defer to Madam Chair on that.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1935.02)            |
| 1940.02 | 1942.02 | Madam Chair?                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1940.02)            |
| 1942.02 | 1948.02 | It's because we have a non-commissioned member.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1942.02)            |
| 1948.02 | 1954.02 | Stephanie Candler, the Human Resources Director, is a non-voting member of the personnel committee.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1948.02)            |
| 1954.02 | 1962.02 | Standing committees only are, per our rules, standing committees are commission-only committees.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1954.02)            |
| 1962.02 | 1966.02 | Okay, so audit committee would not be a standing committee?                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1962.02)            |
| 1966.02 | 1969.02 | Because that has non-commissioned members as well.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1966.02)            |
| 1969.02 | 1970.02 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1969.02)            |
| 1970.02 | 1971.02 | Okay, so that's a...                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1970.02)            |
| 1971.02 | 1973.02 | There are only five standing committees.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1971.02)            |
| 1973.02 | 1980.02 | I dare not ask why that was set up in the first place, because God knows when it was set up.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1973.02)            |
| 1980.02 | 1985.02 | Long before any of us, I imagine.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1980.02)            |
| 1985.02 | 1986.02 | Ms. Fraser?                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1985.02)            |
| 1986.02 | 1995.02 | As I said, that may answer the question of the personnel committee really isn't kind of a committee that's just hanging out there.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1986.02)            |
| 1995.02 | 2004.02 | It follows the other committee structures that have non-commissioned members, correct?                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1995.02)            |
| 2004.02 | 2007.02 | I think also, if I recall correctly, I don't have it in front of me,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2004.02)            |
| 2007.02 | 2011.02 | but I believe that membership on the personnel committee is a two-year appointment,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2007.02)            |
| 2011.02 | 2018.02 | and understanding committees are appointed annually, so that's a second difference.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2011.02)            |
| 2018.02 | 2019.02 | Mr. Kuenbaker?                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2018.02)            |
| 2019.02 | 2021.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2019.02)            |
| 2021.02 | 2028.02 | I think historically, because the chairperson has had so much responsibilities                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2021.02)            |
| 2028.02 | 2033.02 | with all these outside requirements as chair of the commission,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2028.02)            |
| 2033.02 | 2036.02 | what they were trying to do in a lot of cases, I think,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2033.02)            |
| 2036.02 | 2045.02 | was to allow other members who aren't chair or vice chair to have the opportunity to serve as a chair of a committee.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2036.02)            |
| 2046.02 | 2052.02 | That's why you don't have the chairman chair of all the committees.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2046.02)            |
| 2052.02 | 2060.02 | Really, you can ask Larson that the amount of outside events that he had to attend                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2052.02)            |
| 2060.02 | 2067.02 | and committees that he was responsible for as the chairperson of the commission, it's pretty amazing.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2060.02)            |
| 2067.02 | 2077.02 | So I think the intent was no chairman could be the chairman of a committee was for that reason.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2067.02)            |
| 2082.02 | 2085.02 | Anyone else?                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2082.02)            |
| 2085.02 | 2094.02 | I still, you know, I'm looking towards the future that maybe we don't have a problem,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2085.02)            |
| 2094.02 | 2101.02 | but I'm telling you, in the future, we could have a problem with a very, very strong chairperson.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2094.02)            |
| 2101.02 | 2105.02 | They may have an issue that they're focused on,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2101.02)            |
| 2105.02 | 2110.02 | and they set up a special committee to look into this,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2105.02)            |
| 2110.02 | 2116.02 | and those five people elect that chair as the chair of that committee,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2110.02)            |
| 2116.02 | 2121.02 | and that chair can guide that in any direction they want to go.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2116.02)            |
| 2121.02 | 2126.02 | The chair is a very strong position, very, very strong position,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2121.02)            |
| 2126.02 | 2141.02 | and Mr. Law Director, can the chair set up a special committee just by appointment?                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2126.02)            |
| 2152.02 | 2156.02 | Yes, Jill points out to me that it's section H.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2152.02)            |
| 2156.02 | 2164.02 | The chair may from time to time appoint a special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee as the circumstances require,                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2156.02)            |
| 2164.02 | 2169.02 | but such a special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee shall be disbanded when it completes its assigned work,                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2164.02)            |
| 2169.02 | 2175.02 | and in no case shall it exist longer than one year unless extended by resolution of the commission.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2169.02)            |
| 2176.02 | 2180.02 | No special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee should be appointed for any purpose                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2176.02)            |
| 2180.02 | 2183.02 | when there's a standing committee on the same side.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2180.02)            |
| 2183.02 | 2188.02 | So, temporarily, they could do that, yes.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2183.02)            |
| 2188.02 | 2192.02 | Temporary. Has it ever happened? Probably not. Could it happen? Yes.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2188.02)            |
| 2192.02 | 2201.02 | Yes, it did. Mr. Chairman, when I was chair, I set up a special committee to review possible reforms of the Merit Council.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2192.02)            |
| 2201.02 | 2210.02 | It was for a temporary purpose. It lasted four months, give or take, and disbanded when we completed the work,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2201.02)            |
| 2210.02 | 2216.02 | and it was for a very specific purpose, and then it did its work, and then it came back,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2210.02)            |
| 2216.02 | 2222.02 | and a certain amount of recommendations went to commission, and then the committee itself disbanded.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2216.02)            |
| 2222.02 | 2227.02 | I didn't want to bring that up, but I'm glad you did.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2222.02)            |
| 2228.02 | 2231.02 | It was part of the legislative process.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2228.02)            |
| 2236.02 | 2248.02 | I think, if I could, Mr. Chair, I think without some specific language or something that specifically helps address a future problem,                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2236.02)            |
| 2248.02 | 2256.02 | I think everybody's struggling. I understand your concept, and we often work on rules that are not necessarily going to pertain to us,                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2248.02)            |
| 2256.02 | 2262.02 | but future commissions, but I think everybody's struggling to figure out, like Commissioner Fraser said,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2256.02)            |
| 2262.02 | 2269.02 | what are we fixing, and is there some very specific language that helps address?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2262.02)            |
| 2269.02 | 2278.02 | I mean, if you want to propose that no commission chair serve as the chair of any committee,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2269.02)            |
| 2278.02 | 2283.02 | then that's a very specific action, but I don't think we've determined that yet.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2278.02)            |
| 2283.02 | 2289.02 | Ultimately, we have a chair election every year, so I can play the other side of the equation,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2283.02)            |
| 2289.02 | 2298.02 | which is if for some reason you had a chair that was very authoritarian and very controlling and had lots of votes and lots of people,                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2289.02)            |
| 2298.02 | 2302.02 | then you ultimately could change the chair within 12 months.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2298.02)            |
| 2302.02 | 2311.02 | So we have lots of checks and balances to make sure somebody doesn't hold essentially too much power at any given time.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2302.02)            |
| 2311.02 | 2318.02 | Ultimately, the chair is more the parliamentarian and the organizer and the coordinator of many things                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2311.02)            |
| 2318.02 | 2327.02 | than the decision maker when it comes to policy, but I think that's why we're struggling, if I can sum it up.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2318.02)            |
| 2327.02 | 2338.02 | I will – if it's okay, I will sit down and discuss with the law director and see if this should move forward or not.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2327.02)            |
| 2338.02 | 2343.02 | So if it is, it will be on the next agenda. If not, it won't be on the next agenda.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2338.02)            |
| 2343.02 | 2347.02 | All right. Number eight, correct, hopefully.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2343.02)            |
| 2347.02 | 2354.02 | Discussion and consideration, page 15, rule section K, beer board, order of business.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2347.02)            |
| 2354.02 | 2359.02 | Is it necessary – again, this is for the future.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2354.02)            |
| 2359.02 | 2364.02 | We're going to have probably five new members.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2359.02)            |
| 2364.02 | 2368.02 | Do we need an order of business for the beer board like we do in zoning?                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2364.02)            |
| 2368.02 | 2373.02 | It says, you know, this is first, second, third, fourth, fifth, like that.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2368.02)            |
| 2373.02 | 2379.02 | So we will have an order in our rules, in our records.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2373.02)            |
| 2379.02 | 2380.02 | That's why I brought this up.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2379.02)            |
| 2380.02 | 2393.02 | We don't have – at this point in time, if you'll look.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2380.02)            |
| 2393.02 | 2399.02 | Yeah, just an agenda, an agenda like we have in zoning.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2393.02)            |
| 2399.02 | 2400.02 | Mr. Kuhnbaker.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2399.02)            |
| 2400.02 | 2401.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2400.02)            |
| 2402.02 | 2410.02 | Yeah, and I think that would help the clerk's office because sometimes we put the suspensions and revocations first                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2402.02)            |
| 2410.02 | 2416.02 | and then you have the folks that are here just for a new beer license sitting in the audience,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2410.02)            |
| 2416.02 | 2420.02 | where if that was reversed and it was actually in a format,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2416.02)            |
| 2420.02 | 2426.02 | because we should be taking the people here for beer licenses that haven't had a violation                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2420.02)            |
| 2426.02 | 2432.02 | and then do the revocations and suspensions after that point.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2426.02)            |
| 2432.02 | 2437.02 | But right now we have no – the clerk can do whichever way.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2432.02)            |
| 2437.02 | 2439.02 | Mr. Jay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2437.02)            |
| 2439.02 | 2440.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2439.02)            |
| 2440.02 | 2441.02 | I think it's good.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2440.02)            |
| 2441.02 | 2448.02 | We've spent a lot of time over the last four or five years doing everything from defining what is the role of the chair,                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2441.02)            |
| 2448.02 | 2454.02 | the vice chair, doing a lot of documentation of defining, you know, roles and responsibilities,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2448.02)            |
| 2454.02 | 2458.02 | changing our work – I mean changing how we do our agendas.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2454.02)            |
| 2458.02 | 2463.02 | I think it's a good idea to – anything we can do to clarify, clean it up, put it in writing                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2458.02)            |
| 2463.02 | 2471.02 | and make it easier for the next commission, I'm all for because it's been a bit of a loose mess                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2463.02)            |
| 2471.02 | 2474.02 | and we've really done a good job of kind of tightening it up.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2471.02)            |
| 2474.02 | 2477.02 | So I'd say yes.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2474.02)            |
| 2477.02 | 2481.02 | Mr. Law Director, can we do this or do we have to have it in a motion?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2477.02)            |
| 2481.02 | 2483.02 | I mean –                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2481.02)            |
| 2483.02 | 2485.02 | I mean without a motion.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2483.02)            |
| 2485.02 | 2494.02 | Well, I mean I think if you pass a motion asking that we codify basically an agenda                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2485.02)            |
| 2494.02 | 2498.02 | or order of business for the beer board, we can certainly put one together.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2494.02)            |
| 2498.02 | 2504.02 | And if you want the new applications to come before the disciplinary actions,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2498.02)            |
| 2504.02 | 2510.02 | just let us know and we'll do it in that form.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2504.02)            |
| 2510.02 | 2516.02 | Does the Rules Committee agree that applications should come before any suspensions?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2510.02)            |
| 2516.02 | 2518.02 | I do.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2516.02)            |
| 2518.02 | 2519.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2518.02)            |
| 2519.02 | 2524.02 | Then I'm going to make a motion that we ask the law department to come up with an agenda                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2519.02)            |
| 2524.02 | 2528.02 | for the beer board with applications being first.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2524.02)            |
| 2528.02 | 2530.02 | Second.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2528.02)            |
| 2530.02 | 2534.02 | All right, I have a motion by the chair, second by Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2530.02)            |
| 2534.02 | 2536.02 | Any more discussion?                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2534.02)            |
| 2541.02 | 2544.02 | Anybody?                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2541.02)            |
| 2544.02 | 2546.02 | Yeah, because we can discuss it.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2544.02)            |

| 2586.02 | 2588.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chairman.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2586.02)            |
| 2588.02 | 2594.02 | And, of course, everybody knows that the chair of county commission has the oversight over the travel budget                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2588.02)            |
| 2594.02 | 2597.02 | and can decide how that's paid.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2594.02)            |
| 2597.02 | 2604.02 | In the past, I've looked at how other counties in Tennessee handle their travel budgets for the ones that have it.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2597.02)            |
| 2604.02 | 2610.02 | And one that I guess I kind of admired was Hamilton County.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2604.02)            |
| 2610.02 | 2619.02 | And what they do is they have, and let's just say for round numbers, if we have a $22,000 travel budget,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2610.02)            |
| 2619.02 | 2622.02 | that is $2,000 per commissioner.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2619.02)            |
| 2622.02 | 2631.02 | And the way they work it is if, for instance, let's just say Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Hill,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2622.02)            |
| 2631.02 | 2644.02 | have used up their $2,000 worth of travel budget and Commissioner Lee still has $1,000 in her account, basically,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2631.02)            |
| 2644.02 | 2650.02 | and Commissioner Hill and Jay want to go to a conference in Texas,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2644.02)            |
| 2650.02 | 2658.02 | Commissioner Lee could say, hey, I'll take $500 out of my travel and give it to Hill and to Jay.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2650.02)            |
| 2658.02 | 2665.02 | So that way, and also with a set amount designated for each commissioner,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2658.02)            |
| 2665.02 | 2671.02 | you don't have, say, two or three commissioners using up the total fund for travel.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2665.02)            |
| 2671.02 | 2678.02 | This way, it's a uniform, you don't actually get paid, you know, you don't have that,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2671.02)            |
| 2678.02 | 2685.02 | but it's just in record that you get this amount for travel and, you know,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2678.02)            |
| 2685.02 | 2688.02 | decide how you're going to spend it accordingly.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2685.02)            |
| 2688.02 | 2692.02 | But if two or three commissioners don't ever want to go to a conference,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2688.02)            |
| 2692.02 | 2694.02 | don't ever want to go to County Government Day,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2692.02)            |
| 2694.02 | 2702.02 | then they could allocate those funds to the commissioners who do want to go to those events.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2694.02)            |
| 2702.02 | 2704.02 | Anyone else?                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2702.02)            |
| 2704.02 | 2710.02 | And I'd be glad to get the language together based on how other counties do it,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2704.02)            |
| 2710.02 | 2714.02 | if you're interested in going forward with that.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2710.02)            |
| 2714.02 | 2715.02 | Commissioner Hill.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2714.02)            |
| 2715.02 | 2724.02 | I guess I would go back to the question that Commissioner Frazier did in the last issue that came up.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2715.02)            |
| 2724.02 | 2727.02 | Is that, in fact, a problem?                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2724.02)            |
| 2727.02 | 2732.02 | Is this a problem that we've had?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2727.02)            |
| 2732.02 | 2738.02 | I don't know, because I think we've had to add to our budget over the last couple of years                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2732.02)            |
| 2738.02 | 2743.02 | because more commissioners are now going.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2738.02)            |
| 2743.02 | 2750.02 | But, again, it would just be more of an equitable, everybody gets the exact same amount,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2743.02)            |
| 2750.02 | 2757.02 | and then if it needs to be adjusted, you can adjust it internally.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2750.02)            |
| 2757.02 | 2758.02 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2757.02)            |
| 2758.02 | 2772.02 | The potential problem with that might be these commissioners that choose not to travel at all,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2758.02)            |
| 2772.02 | 2779.02 | then does it become a mad dash for the other commissioners to go and say, I want your $2,000?                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2772.02)            |
| 2780.02 | 2783.02 | I mean, I'm just asking.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2780.02)            |
| 2783.02 | 2790.02 | If you're going to piece it out per person like that, that could potentially just create...                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2783.02)            |
| 2790.02 | 2795.02 | Well, you could also have three commissioners use the entire budget                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2790.02)            |
| 2795.02 | 2799.02 | and then people who want to go to County Government Day can't go,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2795.02)            |
| 2799.02 | 2803.02 | or to the legislative conference in May can't go because it's gone.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2799.02)            |
| 2803.02 | 2808.02 | So to your knowledge, has any commissioner been told they could not go to a conference?                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2803.02)            |
| 2808.02 | 2811.02 | No, they've not been told, but the budget had to be increased.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2808.02)            |
| 2811.02 | 2812.02 | Had to be adjusted.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2811.02)            |
| 2812.02 | 2813.02 | Adjusted outward.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2812.02)            |
| 2813.02 | 2820.02 | So if you've been on commission longer than any of us, is that a frequent occurrence?                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2813.02)            |
| 2820.02 | 2824.02 | Well, previously we only had three commissioners who went to conferences.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2820.02)            |
| 2824.02 | 2827.02 | Now we've got close to nine.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2824.02)            |
| 2827.02 | 2831.02 | So the budget's had to go up to accommodate for that.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2827.02)            |
| 2831.02 | 2836.02 | But if you've got nine out of 11 that want to go to a conference                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2831.02)            |
| 2836.02 | 2842.02 | and, let's say, they're not local, they're in Hawaii or Seattle,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2836.02)            |
| 2842.02 | 2845.02 | wherever it is, it's going to cost more money, and that's what I'm saying.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2842.02)            |
| 2845.02 | 2855.02 | You can run into an issue where three people or four people can wipe out the entire budget by going to two events.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2845.02)            |
| 2855.02 | 2857.02 | Mr. Jay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2855.02)            |
| 2857.02 | 2860.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2857.02)            |
| 2860.02 | 2864.02 | The chair has a lot of leeway and discretion,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2860.02)            |
| 2864.02 | 2869.02 | and I'm not aware of anybody who's ever been turned down to go to a conference.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2864.02)            |
| 2869.02 | 2874.02 | The budget has been amended, but I'll just remind everybody,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2869.02)            |
| 2874.02 | 2882.02 | the reason the budget has to be amended at time to time was, I think, prior to, let's see,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2874.02)            |
| 2882.02 | 2884.02 | I was elected first in 2018.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2882.02)            |
| 2884.02 | 2890.02 | In the years 2015, 16, and 17, the commission budget was cut to, like, the bare bones.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2884.02)            |
| 2890.02 | 2895.02 | We didn't even have meals to help commissioners that were here for 10 or 12 hours,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2890.02)            |
| 2895.02 | 2898.02 | much less office supplies, much less, you know,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2895.02)            |
| 2898.02 | 2902.02 | we had the dumpiest conference room and office in the entire building,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2898.02)            |
| 2902.02 | 2905.02 | and, you know, Drusilla didn't have, like, a bottle of water.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2902.02)            |
| 2905.02 | 2909.02 | You know, it was just slashed and burned,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2905.02)            |
| 2909.02 | 2914.02 | and only when we sort of realized we had to bring the commission office into the modern age                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2909.02)            |
| 2914.02 | 2917.02 | did we go and basically ask for more money,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2914.02)            |
| 2917.02 | 2920.02 | and the finance department was more than happy to accommodate it,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2917.02)            |
| 2920.02 | 2924.02 | and I think ever since has been able to say, look, what's an appropriate budget?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2920.02)            |
| 2924.02 | 2928.02 | I personally think it's great that more commissioners are going to these conferences,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2924.02)            |
| 2928.02 | 2932.02 | and I think the chair can certainly advocate for more money,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2928.02)            |
| 2932.02 | 2935.02 | and as we go through the budget process,                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2932.02)            |
| 2935.02 | 2940.02 | maybe more modernize the budget even more to say what is more appropriate,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2935.02)            |
| 2940.02 | 2945.02 | because we do have commissioners going to NACO conferences, which is pretty rare, but growing.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2940.02)            |
| 2946.02 | 2949.02 | The commissioner conferences are getting more popular,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2946.02)            |
| 2949.02 | 2953.02 | so I think we should ‑‑ I don't see a rule change here that fixes much                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2949.02)            |
| 2953.02 | 2956.02 | other than we should maybe work on our budget                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2953.02)            |
| 2956.02 | 2960.02 | and let the chair support everybody as best they can,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2956.02)            |
| 2960.02 | 2964.02 | but I don't ‑‑ I'm not sure I see a problem fixing it,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2960.02)            |
| 2964.02 | 2967.02 | and if we go through that, then I'm going to, you know,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2964.02)            |
| 2967.02 | 2969.02 | we're all lobbying each other to give each other,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2967.02)            |
| 2969.02 | 2971.02 | hey, maybe you don't want to go to that conference.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2969.02)            |
| 2971.02 | 2973.02 | Give me your ‑‑ I don't know.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2971.02)            |
| 2973.02 | 2976.02 | It just occurred to me that I think we should just amend the budget                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2973.02)            |
| 2976.02 | 2981.02 | and get some more resources to participate, so that's just my thought.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2976.02)            |
| 2981.02 | 2984.02 | Thank you. Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2981.02)            |
| 2984.02 | 2985.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2984.02)            |
| 2985.02 | 2989.02 | Just to echo what Commissioner Jay said, he kind of took everything I was going to say.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2985.02)            |
| 2989.02 | 2993.02 | I think this is more of a budget issue that we need to look at internally                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2989.02)            |
| 2993.02 | 2998.02 | and go from there, because I don't want to deter anyone                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2993.02)            |
| 2999.02 | 3003.02 | from obtaining additional information or education or resources,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2999.02)            |
| 3003.02 | 3010.02 | and, you know, I would like to go to, you know, lots of things,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3003.02)            |
| 3010.02 | 3014.02 | but I don't want to hinder anyone else from being able to go as well,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3010.02)            |
| 3014.02 | 3017.02 | so I really think that we can look at this like Commissioner Jay said                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3014.02)            |
| 3017.02 | 3019.02 | and modernize the budget.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3017.02)            |
| 3019.02 | 3024.02 | I think we've got, as I've said before, a more community‑minded body                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3019.02)            |
| 3024.02 | 3030.02 | than we've seen in a long time, and we're willing and ready and able to do more,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3024.02)            |
| 3030.02 | 3036.02 | so I think we should just look at that, if that's okay.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3030.02)            |

| 3044.02 | 3051.02 | I just have a comment in hearing what you're saying.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3044.02)            |
| 3051.02 | 3056.02 | If we were going to put restrictions at all,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3051.02)            |
| 3056.02 | 3058.02 | and I caution myself even saying this,                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3056.02)            |
| 3058.02 | 3066.02 | but perhaps limiting out‑of‑state travel to not more than one a year                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3058.02)            |
| 3066.02 | 3071.02 | with special permission of the chair for a second one                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3066.02)            |
| 3071.02 | 3077.02 | or something like that that, you know, would keep,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3071.02)            |
| 3077.02 | 3081.02 | if we have a propensity to have a commission or two                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3077.02)            |
| 3081.02 | 3085.02 | that want to go all over the country four or five times a year,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3081.02)            |
| 3085.02 | 3091.02 | that might help that if you all even think something like that is necessary,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3085.02)            |
| 3091.02 | 3097.02 | but that would at least then offer some type of a stop gap                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3091.02)            |
| 3097.02 | 3103.02 | but not close any door either.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3097.02)            |
| 3103.02 | 3105.02 | Madam Chair, you're recognized.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3103.02)            |

| 3107.02 | 3116.02 | Commissioner Hill, out‑of‑state travel has to be approved by the chair anyway.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3107.02)            |
| 3116.02 | 3120.02 | The out‑of‑state travel is very, very expensive.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3116.02)            |
| 3120.02 | 3123.02 | You know, it could be upwards to $5,000 just for one trip,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3120.02)            |
| 3123.02 | 3126.02 | which eats into the budget in a hurry.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3123.02)            |
| 3126.02 | 3130.02 | I guess the best thing that we need to do is,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3126.02)            |
| 3130.02 | 3132.02 | we're probably too late this time,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3130.02)            |
| 3132.02 | 3135.02 | but next year, have a list, say, Commissioner Daley,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3132.02)            |
| 3135.02 | 3138.02 | where are you planning on going?                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3135.02)            |
| 3138.02 | 3140.02 | So, Drew will know.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3138.02)            |
| 3140.02 | 3142.02 | She knows about what it costs per person,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3140.02)            |
| 3142.02 | 3148.02 | so we can get that budget to where we don't have to go back and amend the budget.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3142.02)            |
| 3148.02 | 3151.02 | Commissioner McMaker, if you want to research that more,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3148.02)            |

| 3167.02 | 3171.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3167.02)            |
| 3171.02 | 3177.02 | It would be beneficial for the person that's appearing from NOx planning                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3171.02)            |
| 3177.02 | 3183.02 | to be one of the senior planners as opposed to the executive director.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3177.02)            |
| 3183.02 | 3188.02 | I would prefer to hear information and have that person on hand                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3183.02)            |
| 3188.02 | 3196.02 | who's a senior planner as opposed to actually works the nuts and bolts of that process,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3188.02)            |
| 3196.02 | 3205.02 | as opposed to just the executive director coming and reading the verbiage in front of them.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3196.02)            |
| 3205.02 | 3211.02 | To me, that doesn't do us, there's no benefit to us there.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3205.02)            |
| 3211.02 | 3215.02 | And when we say on number five, a staff representative,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3211.02)            |
| 3215.02 | 3222.02 | that's never really been spelled out, what is a staff representative.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3215.02)            |
| 3222.02 | 3228.02 | So this is for the thought process here.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3222.02)            |
| 3228.02 | 3230.02 | So what is your recommendation?                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3228.02)            |
| 3230.02 | 3235.02 | Well, I was going to let Mr. Chair, if you'll defer to Commissioner Frazier,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3230.02)            |
| 3235.02 | 3237.02 | I'll hear what she has to say.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3235.02)            |

| 3238.02 | 3239.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3238.02)            |
| 3239.02 | 3241.02 | I would agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3239.02)            |
| 3241.02 | 3245.02 | It is extremely helpful when we do have senior planning staff present                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3241.02)            |
| 3245.02 | 3250.02 | and can answer questions when they've been actually working on the cases.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3245.02)            |
| 3250.02 | 3255.02 | I think it's something that we should probably have a discussion with Planning Commission and staff first                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3250.02)            |
| 3255.02 | 3260.02 | before we change our rules and get their input and guidance,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3255.02)            |
| 3260.02 | 3263.02 | just because it is impacting their staff and their team.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3260.02)            |
| 3263.02 | 3269.02 | But I agree it is extremely beneficial and helpful to me to have this senior staff                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3263.02)            |
| 3269.02 | 3271.02 | and senior planners present.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3269.02)            |
| 3271.02 | 3278.02 | But I think we should take it back to Planning Commission and talk to them first.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3271.02)            |

| 3281.02 | 3284.02 | Mr. Schoonmaker, would you be willing to go to Planning                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3281.02)            |
| 3284.02 | 3288.02 | and ask them if they would bring it back?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3284.02)            |
| 3288.02 | 3289.02 | Be glad to.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3288.02)            |

| 3304.02 | 3305.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3304.02)            |
| 3305.02 | 3309.02 | Again, this is something that's come up several times during our meetings,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3305.02)            |
| 3309.02 | 3313.02 | and it's just a process that I don't think we've actually been following,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3309.02)            |
| 3313.02 | 3320.02 | and that's when we do have an applicant who asks for a withdrawal or deferral at the zoning session.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3313.02)            |
| 3320.02 | 3325.02 | According to our rules, if they do request a withdrawal,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3320.02)            |
| 3325.02 | 3330.02 | then the matter should be considered a denial if they don't follow proper process                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3325.02)            |
| 3330.02 | 3336.02 | and submit a request to postpone or withdraw by a certain time frame.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3330.02)            |
| 3336.02 | 3340.02 | So I wanted to bring that to the body's attention                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3336.02)            |
| 3340.02 | 3343.02 | and ask is that something that we need to further clarify?                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3340.02)            |
| 3343.02 | 3347.02 | Is that something that the body would like to change?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3343.02)            |
| 3347.02 | 3352.02 | But it's something that currently we're not following regularly.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3347.02)            |
| 3352.02 | 3361.02 | So I just wanted to get people's input and discussion.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3352.02)            |
| 3361.02 | 3362.02 | Mr. Jay.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3361.02)            |
| 3362.02 | 3363.02 | Thank you, Mr. Chair.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3362.02)            |
| 3363.02 | 3370.02 | I think like any great rule, no matter how we write it, somebody's going to have a workaround.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3363.02)            |
| 3370.02 | 3377.02 | If I was an applicant and I didn't get my deferral in in time in my rules, I just wouldn't show                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3370.02)            |
| 3377.02 | 3384.02 | because the rules say a no-show is an automatic 30-day deferral as a courtesy.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3377.02)            |
| 3384.02 | 3390.02 | So I mean I think there's always going to be a workaround.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3384.02)            |
| 3390.02 | 3398.02 | The hardest part is as stuff comes up who I think tracking like, I don't know,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3390.02)            |
| 3398.02 | 3403.02 | I'm trying to think of a recent circumstance where they may have come in and asked for a deferral.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3398.02)            |
| 3403.02 | 3404.02 | We haven't had one of those.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3403.02)            |
| 3404.02 | 3409.02 | So the whole point of this was originally we had people that sort of read the tea leaves,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3404.02)            |
| 3409.02 | 3412.02 | saw they were going to lose the vote, and then last minute pulled out.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3409.02)            |
| 3412.02 | 3418.02 | And we were trying to present this was the fix to keep people from bailing at the last minute                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3412.02)            |
| 3418.02 | 3420.02 | when everybody's shown up.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3418.02)            |
| 3420.02 | 3422.02 | So are we just not enforcing this?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3420.02)            |
| 3422.02 | 3425.02 | Is that what you're saying?                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3422.02)            |
| 3425.02 | 3427.02 | Yes, that's correct.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3425.02)            |
| 3427.02 | 3430.02 | We've had instances where applicants have come before us                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3427.02)            |
| 3430.02 | 3435.02 | and actually asked the commissioner maybe to put forth a withdrawal                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3430.02)            |
| 3435.02 | 3439.02 | or say the applicant has asked to defer.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3435.02)            |
| 3439.02 | 3445.02 | And per our rules, the matter should be considered a denial                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3439.02)            |
| 3445.02 | 3455.02 | if it did not follow the correct submittal process for a postponement, deferral, or withdrawal.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3445.02)            |
| 3455.02 | 3458.02 | Yeah, I think you should weigh in on this.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3455.02)            |
| 3458.02 | 3463.02 | Mr. Jay, the Tazewell Pike, I'll talk.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3458.02)            |
| 3463.02 | 3468.02 | Tazewell Pike was one that he wanted to defer and he couldn't.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3463.02)            |
| 3468.02 | 3472.02 | It would be considered a denial, so we changed it.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3468.02)            |
| 3472.02 | 3478.02 | Madam Chair made the motion to defer for 30 days so he wouldn't be withdrawn.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3472.02)            |
| 3478.02 | 3482.02 | Then Commissioner Beeler had the same one, I think, a month or two ago.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3478.02)            |
| 3482.02 | 3485.02 | So instead of what we've done, we did the workaround                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3482.02)            |
| 3485.02 | 3491.02 | to where we as a commissioner can request to defer.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3485.02)            |
| 3491.02 | 3497.02 | But if we follow the rules, if they don't have it within five days, whatever,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3491.02)            |
| 3497.02 | 3500.02 | it has to be in writing within five days, that Wednesday before.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3497.02)            |
| 3500.02 | 3506.02 | We could also suspend the rules at any point and then do whatever we wanted anyway.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3500.02)            |
| 3506.02 | 3514.02 | I think the general sentiment of this body has been we are hesitant to get people                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3506.02)            |
| 3514.02 | 3518.02 | into a point in which they cannot use their land for a year                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3514.02)            |
| 3518.02 | 3522.02 | because of some scheduling or parliamentary issues.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3518.02)            |
| 3522.02 | 3529.02 | We're really hesitant to just jack people when they're not close.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3522.02)            |
| 3529.02 | 3534.02 | But this was the stopgap to the last thing, so is there a proposed stopgap for the next thing?                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3529.02)            |
| 3534.02 | 3537.02 | Or is it just a matter of enforcing it?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3534.02)            |
| 3537.02 | 3541.02 | All of our rules, there's probably 20 rules the last time we really did a deep dive                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3537.02)            |
| 3541.02 | 3545.02 | that we don't enforce on a daily basis, like how many minutes you get to talk                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3541.02)            |
| 3545.02 | 3547.02 | and how many times you get to talk.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3545.02)            |
| 3547.02 | 3552.02 | There's all kinds of little things that are the gray area of how strict we are.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3547.02)            |
| 3552.02 | 3558.02 | So I guess if there's specific language to debate, go for it.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3552.02)            |
| 3559.02 | 3565.02 | But I don't know how somebody wouldn't just do another workaround.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3559.02)            |
| 3565.02 | 3573.02 | This is what I'd ask Mr. Fraser to do, to watch and take notes of anything that's coming up in the future.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3565.02)            |
| 3573.02 | 3580.02 | And if we see that it can become an issue, I think we need to bring it back in the future sometime.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3573.02)            |
| 3580.02 | 3581.02 | I'm happy to do that.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3580.02)            |
| 3581.02 | 3584.02 | I understand exactly what you're saying.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3581.02)            |

| 3645.02 | 3649.02 | And that's what we go by, our county rules and our Robert's Rules of Order.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3645.02)            |
| 3649.02 | 3653.02 | Don't be mad at me, but I'm just looking at the future, okay?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3649.02)            |
| 3653.02 | 3655.02 | It's what I'm looking for.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3653.02)            |
| 3655.02 | 3659.02 | Anything, anybody else on the Rules Committee?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3655.02)            |
| 3659.02 | 3664.02 | All right, we'll have probably one final Rules Committee sometime in July.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3659.02)            |
| 3664.02 | 3665.02 | Any other things?                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3664.02)            |
| 3665.02 | 3667.02 | I need a motion adjourned because it's 4 o'clock.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3665.02)            |
| 3667.02 | 3669.02 | So moved.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3667.02)            |
| 3669.02 | 3670.02 | Second.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3669.02)            |
| 3670.02 | 3671.02 | We are adjourned.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3670.02)            |
