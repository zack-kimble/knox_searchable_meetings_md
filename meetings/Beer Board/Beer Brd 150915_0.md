| 0:03:23| the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=203)|

| 0:03:59| Building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals, and the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Okay. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=248)|

| 0:04:11| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Do you know the former owner of that business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| We contacted the former tenant at that business and talked to him today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| and we anticipate that he's going to either find it or be able to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| that he's going to release the former license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Okay. Ms. Dyer, does that satisfy you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=275)|

| 0:05:10| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| We need the beer permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Are you going to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=315)|

| 0:05:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=326)|

| 0:05:29| And you can take care of that at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Next is the Charlotte Taqueria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Well, the 6th District is really getting lots of places to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| My name is Ben Austin, and our address for the restaurant is 314 South Gay Street, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Additional owner-manager applications for the three different owners and managers, building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Apparently an issue with the owners' names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Are you familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Do you want to tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| We have to re-advertise is the question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| That's for you, I guess, Ms. Taqueria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Tracey, do you recall that when I think they had a little bit different name when the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| checks were run and had difficulty locating them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| We've since received the background checks under the correct name, so we were good on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| My question was, we have advertised under the incorrect names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Would that, I guess, that would be for Mr. Frost to determine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Well, the purpose of the advertising is to put the public on notice of who the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I certainly understand how some people have, for lack of a better term, Americanized their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| names, but that's not what they originally turned in is not their given name, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| not sure that advertising has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So do we need to advertise this again and move it to the October 27th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| I mean, probably out of an abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| How many days advertisement is required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Ten, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Ten days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| How many days advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Just one day, but at least ten days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Okay, and there's not another meeting until October 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| That's a little hard on this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| I'm wondering if we can have a special meeting before the next council meeting in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| if we publish in time, just to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| When are you planning to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Hopefully the middle of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Yeah, we can still meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Okay, so it's not a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Always a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Good plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Okay, so do we have a motion to defer this to the October 27th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| We'll get everything re-advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Everybody will be in business then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Do you want to tell us about your business, though, so we can anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| We are trying to do just local, fresh ingredients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| and kind of what Stock and Barrel did with burgers and bourbon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| we want to do it tacos and tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| We're working directly with farmers around here to procure the freshest ingredients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| including beef, pigs, grinding our own corn, the next meal process to make tortillas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Okay, next is community shares for the Knoxville Brewer's Jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=526)|
| 0:08:55| When is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=538)|

| 0:09:14| Do you need my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| No, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Ms. Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Do we now have a server plan in the file also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Do you want to tell us about Brewer's Jam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Some of us forget from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| It's coming up on October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| It's a craft brew tasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| There are probably about 50 brewers bringing several kinds of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| and people can taste the different kinds that they like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| and learn information about the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And hopefully, in most cases, the brewers are there to give people information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| And it's a fundraiser for community shares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Quick question before she leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Okay, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| How many of those are Knoxville brewers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| I know we keep getting more and more brewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| but obviously you're drawing from a larger crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Well, that's a good question, and I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| But we ask every Knoxville brewer, and pretty much everyone does it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| except there are a few, like I just happened to be at a meeting before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| with someone from Alliance Brewing Company, which is just starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| And they're so small, they really can't come yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| But if they're big enough and have been going on for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| all the Knoxville brewers are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| No, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Don't go away until we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Okay, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Cystic fibrosis foundation has withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Apparently we're not going to have wine on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Next is the Dilemma Ultra Lounge and Grill on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=658)|
| 0:11:10| My name is Kevin Cherry, and my address is 2630 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Sergeant Hunter, no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| We need a copy of the sales tax registration or certificate of zoning from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| So we have a little bit of stuff to accumulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| When do you plan to open your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| October 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| You've got a lot of work to do in that short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| I have everything but inspections, approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| This is in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Yeah, I was going to move to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| but I've got to ask this gentleman, where did you get the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| What does that evoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| The Dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| What is the Dilemma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| The third beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| The fourth beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| It's pretty much usually people that are facing a dilemma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| they go out to bars and clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Clear their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| That's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Move to adjourn to clear our dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| We have a motion to approve, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| You might want to put that address in your GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| The Intrepid Productions tomato battle at Chilhowee Park is not going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| So we'll have to move them along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Can we have that here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| They need to go to Granger County in July for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=769)|

| 0:13:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| We need a copy of the sales tax registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Counsel in Delaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Counsel in Delaware, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| There's no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Move to approve, pen and file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=801)|

| 0:13:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Now tell us about Jazzy Lynn's restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Well, I've been playing music since I was like 14, and my mother wound up with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| She bought the building, so I kind of got a little barbecue place and put the little band in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| So that's basically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Good food and good music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Good food and good music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And when do you plan to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| I've been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=822)|

| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| You're just not serving beer yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| No, I'm not serving beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=827)|

| 0:18:58| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Councilman De La Voca, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| I'm going to move for approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| And I'm going to ask the gentleman if he'll tell us what he's going to do that's different than other brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| Obviously, you've got a Germanic beer coming, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| It's going to be a German brewery and taproom and beer garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| So we have a lot of outdoor seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| You bringing in special hops or special ingredients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Yes, all our ingredients are imported from Germany to make the beer as authentic as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| So all German crumb barley, hops, and yeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| So we go in a traditional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| So everything is brewed after the Rhinox cabot, the purity law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So it's pretty much going to taste the same way as it does over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1192)|

| 0:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| So we have one missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| No, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| We have three missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| When do you think you're going to be open to actually go and have a brew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| We are hoping to open probably mid of November, maybe late November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1234)|

| 0:20:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| No applicable record and test certification expired September 11th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| We need the plan for server compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Your plan for your server compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I can provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| What I'd like to request is to do the task class this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I've been able to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| So if I can do it this Thursday and just receive your contingent approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| I'll take the certificate once I've finished in this day and get it wrapped up if you all are okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| That's an unusual request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| When's the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Well, I'm from the casual pint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| I've had the task certification for the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| It just expired on Friday, and I've been a little busy, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| But if we could do that, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Your event is October 24th and 25th, and the next beer board meeting is October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I think there's a special exception, so I'd move to approve it pending whatever he needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| Completion of the task force, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Before you leave, I want to hear about the bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Now tell us about the bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| You have to grab a king-size bed and run with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| It's a really cool event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| So Special Spaces is a nonprofit organization here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| and their mission is to remodel bedrooms for terminally ill children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So if you have a little girl, she's diagnosed with cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| they'll give her a princess bedroom or whatever she'd like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| So they do really good work all across the state and really throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| And they're doing a bed race at World's Fair Park as a fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| So what happens is companies like ours, Home Depot, they'll put a team together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| build a bed, and actually race the bed down the straightaway there at World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| behind the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| So it's a really neat fundraising idea, and it goes to a great cause for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| So we're excited to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| And this is the second year they've done it and hope to do it many more years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| The bedrooms that I've seen on TV that have been completed are beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| They're a great cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| So you'll get the task class, and life will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1386)|

| 0:24:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| It has been good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Next is the Tazewell Shell Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1459)|
| 0:24:36| The task class has not been completed and we do not have fingerprints in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Ms. Dyer, do you have anything that's missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| We need a copy of the sales tax registration approval from the Health Department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Based on our past experience with this, people who have not completed the task class and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| the fingerprints are deferred to the next meeting, which is October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Do I have a motion in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I will make that motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| So you cannot sell beer until after you complete the task class and the prints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| We're going to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| We're going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1514)|

| 0:25:19| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Next is Wingstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Wingstop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Wingstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1524)|

| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Sergeant Hunter, the owner, Ms. Roberts, is an out-of-town resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| We have her fingerprints, but the background check has not been received yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| You had to go to an outside authority to get the information forwarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Typically, they go to their local law enforcement agency of where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Have them transmit that to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| So we're going to move on to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1538)|

| 0:25:54| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| So that's in play but not completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| That's correct, and Mr. Williams has no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Ms. Dyer, we need a copy of the sales tax registration, a copy of your LLC, certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| of zoning from MPC, and the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| This is in the Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Well, does it sound like we need to postpone to the next meeting for the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| finality or, I mean, legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Okay, well I'll make a motion we push it to the next meeting to hear it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| That would be October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Okay, just out of curiosity, when was your opening date or tentative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Mid-October to late October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Okay, so that won't be a terrible inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| All right, so we have a motion to defer to October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1614)|

| 0:27:20| Are the wings good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| They're the best, the best in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| Okay, next we have some items to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| The first is Weigel's No. 84 on Chapman Highway, and Mr. Weigel is with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| Bill Weigel, 7104 Hickory Hills Drive, our whole management team's at a seminar in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| I'm the only one left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Last man standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| I am very familiar with this particular situation, and we are asking for a delay in our beer board, our beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| We discovered this is the corner of Chapman Highway and Moody Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| and we discovered some historical, long-term historical issues with this lot after we bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1693)|
| 0:28:23| and we stopped demolition immediately when we found out the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| We're working with the city and TDEC to resolve this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| We're meeting with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| They've invited us over October 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| so we hope we can get this place cleared up and being able to build a store on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| and that's why we're asking for a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Madam Chair and Board members, I've been working with Mr. Weigel and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and then we had meetings with the engineering staff, and it's going, like he said, to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| I didn't know about the Nashville development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| No, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| They have made every attempt to move forward on it, but out of caution and rightly so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| they haven't been able to proceed, so they're not dragging their feet at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and I would certainly recommend, what is it, a six-month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| One year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| One year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| That extension so he can get that property in order where he can open a real nice Weigel store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| on a lot that needs a real nice Weigel store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| I was just going to suggest to Bill that make sure that they resubmit the fingerprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| background check data when you're ready to open so that it won't be too dated to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| Certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| All those in favor of this delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Now, you also have a store that is a different store, but it's at Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Wesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Wesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| When will that store open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| That will open in four weeks, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| That's on my orange juice route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Next is Whiskey Bend Bar and Dance Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Whiskey Bend Bar and Dance Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| The Whiskey Bend Bar and Dance Club was approved on February the 17th, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| On May the 26th, they were granted a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| On July 21st, they were granted a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So we are now here seven months later with no one from Whiskey Bend Bar and Dance Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| and we're obviously not going to go to the bar and dance because they must not be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| I was wondering if Ms. Dyer or someone has an explanation of what their delay is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| what's happening in that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| I think they're going into the Old Food City location there near where the Kmart on Broadway was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| and they split the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I think the owner of the building split it in half, and they ended up with the bad half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| So they're having a lot of construction issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| A lot of remodeling issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| They were not aware they were going to have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Probably fire safety issues too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Well, in light of that and some of the unforeseen matters that they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| I would be willing to ask that we provide an additional delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Did they ask you at any time for 30 days, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I've emailed back and forth with them a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| but I was under the assumption they would be here tonight, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| I hate to add to their already bad burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| I would ask that we have a 30-day delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| and that they be notified that they be here in Heller Highwater next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| They've got advertising up already, a billboard even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So they're moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I live in that area, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Can you get some orange juice for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I'll second that motion to give them 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Ms. Day, did you notify them that they needed to be at this meeting tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| See, I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| I mean, regardless of what their situation is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I'd like to hear from them firsthand in terms of what their problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| So I really can't support this under the circumstances for them not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| And we've extended this how many times, three times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| This has been seven months since it was initially approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| It's been seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| And if Ms. Day –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Well, there's only been two extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Well, but as Ms. Day said, she's had conversations with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| and emailed them and said that they needed to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| so that they could explain to us what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| So I really can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| I'm going to move that we extend it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and that they be notified to be here or else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We probably – that's already been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| The motion on the floor is to extend for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Next on the agenda is the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| WDVX wants to change the location of their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| It's still on the same date, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| And you want to go from where to where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| We want to go from Market Square to the Standard on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I guess we need your name and address too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| My name is Samantha Amick, 301 South Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| And you're moving from point A to point B because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| I can't really answer that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| My guess is that Market Square might have been booked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| and we were a little too late on booking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Have you gone through special events for your – to book this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| I have not personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| But you have reserved the Standard for that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2072)|

| 0:34:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Well, good luck at the Standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Do we have to re-advertise that in some way, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2089)|

| 0:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| And next is the Market House Cafe on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And they were waiting for some final inspections to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| I know they ran into a problem or several there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2102)|
| 0:35:14| Is this Ms. West?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Actually, it's not Ms. West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| It's her uncle or her brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| It's a relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Is there anyone here from the Market House Cafe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| Do I have a motion to defer this to the October 27th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2133)|

| 0:35:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Hopefully, since it's building fire and health department inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| those will be done and they will get their act together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| She came to every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| No, just in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Oh, yes, we have an admin hearing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| There are two businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| The first is the Wagon Wheel, and the second is the Soccer Tacos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| So let's do the Wagon Wheel first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| And give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Actually, my name is Stan Young, and I am counsel for Wagon Wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Wagon Wheel is located at 115 Central Street here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| And I'm sorry, and this is Mark Jarnigan, one of the owners of Wagon Wheel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| as well as the manager, Robert McCarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| And, Sergeant Hunter, do you want to refresh our memory about their citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| Both violations were sales to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| The first one happened May 28th of 2014, was dismissed on costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and the second one happened August 14th of this year, and that one is still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| In the first incident, the server did check the ID of the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| In the second incident, the person at the door incorrectly checked the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| and the server did not check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| So you have submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Yes, ma'am, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And you have paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Yes, ma'am, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Dear Board, thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| What's dismissed on costs mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| It means it's not a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| They made an agreement that once she paid the cost, it'd be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| That was the $300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| The court cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Whatever the court costs were for sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Counsel, I'd like to ask, could you tell us briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| it looks like you're machining up in terms of verifying age on driver's license or other IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2260)|
| 0:37:48| Would you tell us a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| and how you're going to use the new process to sort of avoid this in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Yes, sir, we have two different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Could you give us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I'm sorry, Robert McCarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I'm the general manager for Wagon Wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| We have two different types of ID machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| We have one that's going to be stationed at the front door at all hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Anyone walking through our door will be subject to that ID machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| The second one is placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| So it's a new beep or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yeah, you just walk in, ask for the ID, we check it, and then we put it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| and it pops up with a birth date and says, you know, 21-22-19-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| It gives us that birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| It verifies that that's a legitimate identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| So that deals with your math error of the doorman we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| And the bartenders will have a different but same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| They scan ID back behind the bar as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| I've put into place since this most recent incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| that anybody born in the year 1994 will be double ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| So once we see that their birth date's 94,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| they have to have mine or my assistant manager's approval to get into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| along with the verification with the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| When you said the server failed to ID at the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| is that the waitress or is that the bartender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| It was the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| We had a doorman working that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| and his sole responsible job was to check IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and make sure no one under 21 came into our establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| He did a math error, and they slipped in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| and then our bartender did double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| The bartender didn't follow up with an individual check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Correct, correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| And now he has to do that before he serves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Well, it's a new doorman, but the new doorman has to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| No, I'm talking about the bartender has to now verify before he pours the drink or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| So essentially there will be two sets of eyes looking at the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| The doorman in question that evening has since been released from Wagon Wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| and no longer works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| And on top of this, Wagon Wheel has taken the top shelf class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| that is taught by Mr. Mark Church-James, who is actually here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| There were a number of employees who took that class, nine employees actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| which included a manager and bartenders as well as four doormen who all took that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| and passed that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| That class was taken on, I believe, September 10th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| Unfortunately, I don't have copies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| However, Mr. Church-James is here if you want to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Top Shelf is a very comprehensive program that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| and teaches businesses and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| and is actually one of the leading continuing education areas in checking IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| and making sure that businesses and restaurants are serving alcohol responsibly to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| If someone is not 21, do they get to come in past the doorman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| So it's an admission thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| You have to actually be that age to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| To get into the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| How long have you all been in business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| A little over two years, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| And this is part of a larger group, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| There are several other businesses that fall under the umbrella of a management company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| and Wagon Wheel is one of the businesses that are here in our Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| that operate in the Old City as well as Carlio's, Envy, Southbound, Hanna's, and the Bowery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2490)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| So there are several different businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and Wagon Wheel before in the past has received letters praising the fact that cadets have been sent in before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| and turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| This was unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| There is no excuse for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Wagon Wheel is not making any excuses for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| and that's why they came up with this comprehensive plan to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Beer Board, we have one other case to hear tonight, so I want to just ask you to give me some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| We can either accept their plan and they're fine and that's the end of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| and they will never come before us again, or we can send them to a administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| I would recommend a suspension, revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| I would recommend that we accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| If they come before us again, then they'll be meeting with the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| So we will never see you again for any ill-advised mistakes at Wagon Wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| Only to celebrate Wagon Wheel's success in employing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| Sounds like a plan to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Next is Soccer Taco or the Soccer Senoritas on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| Now this is a TABC issue, and remember while they're coming up here that at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| we automatically had to send them to a hearing officer, but now the law has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| and one of our options is to accept their paperwork and that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| So we need somebody to identify the name of the business and an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Soccer Taco, 9 Market Square, Suite 101, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| On the night of whatever date this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Do you want to help us out here, Ms. Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| The first sale-to-minor occurred on January 11th of 2013 and actually was over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| which is why it didn't trigger an admin hearing for the city board, but is included for history purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2626)|
| 0:43:56| That person did card the cadet and that was adjudicated dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| The second sale-to-minor happened on July 23rd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| The cadet was also carded at that time and that was adjudicated past no trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| And we also know that the remedial plan did not get in by the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| but I believe that Mr. Seymour is representing them now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and he personally appeared yesterday with the fine and the remedial plan, which we now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| So do you want to tell us just in about one minute about the remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| I tried to file it yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I had too much money in the check, so I had to refile it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| The main thing in the remedial plan, from here on out, every customer buying an alcoholic beverage will be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2682)|
| 0:44:53| Scanners have been installed downtown at the cash registers and at the West location, which is not involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| The photo identification will be scanned to determine that it is a valid photo identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| and that the person is 21 years of age or older and before a sale will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| And that's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| It's like when you walk into Kroger's or Weigel's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| If you perhaps buy a six-pack of beer, you have to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| In this case, we're adding a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| That's the major thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| And is that being done at the bartender station, at the waitress station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| The waitress will have to take it to the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| They'll take the ID up and have it scanned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Yes, with the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| And if the ID passes, and by the way, the scanners are installed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| Since the citation, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| There's an app on an iPhone they've been using up until this point since the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Members of the Beer Board, this will need to go to the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| It's going there right now because they didn't file things in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| The question is, does the Beer Board want to now accept what they have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| or send it on where the law department would amend their complaint to take into account the underage margarita sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2781)|
| 0:46:36| Ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| What's the advantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| What are the consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| They're going for a hearing no matter what because they didn't get in their fine and their remedial plan in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2802)|
| 0:46:51| The ordinance, if you don't file those things in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| it automatically triggers the law department filing a noncompliance complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| They've already been suspended by the TABC for 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| To the 29th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| So it's the sale of one margarita to an underage individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| They've gotten in trouble with the TABC and now they're already in trouble with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| for not getting things in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| The question for the Beer Board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| are you all going to want to refer them on for the same underage margarita sale or accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| In mitigation, I would submit that they were trying to file with the TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and were unaware of the dual filing with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| All right, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Mr. Pampin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| I think they're in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| I mean, you know, I don't think we can do anything unless we just want to be over the harsh on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| I mean, they're going to be going before the Board, so I say we accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| We are going to accept this as submitted, even though it was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| And we're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Nod your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Do we need to make a motion, Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| In light of the prior Brown issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Don't move, we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Did you screw that one up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| And we will never see you again because this new system will work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Arthur, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| By the way, there is an app on an iPhone that will do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| We had one other item on the agenda, and that was to discuss the distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| And that was something that Mr. Wallace wanted to really talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| He's not able to be here, and it's hours late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| So let's move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Let's move that to October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150915?start=2944)|
