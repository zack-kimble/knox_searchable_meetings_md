| 0:01:25| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| I know we've got a council member on the way and one that couldn't be here, so we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| I'd like to ask Mr. Rick Emmett to come forward with the presentation and then we'll move towards hearing from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| We're here to talk about the 2011 redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| I guess this body asked me to try to come up with a plan here a month ago when we got the census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| I've given each of you a handout that sort of goes along with this presentation a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| On the screen up here, the first thing we have is the current city map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| I'm sure all of you are familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| On the computer screen right now, it shows the census count as applied to the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=134)|
| 0:02:26| What this shows is that we have a 22% standard deviation range, which is over the 10% I talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=146)|
| 0:02:36| which means that we have to redistrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| You can see all the various total population numbers, how far off we are, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| Councilman Pavlis is 6% above what he should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| Councilman Grieve is 4% below, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| Ms. Palmer is 13% above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Those are the driving factors in trying to do a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| The way we developed this plan, we tried to use as much logic as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| As I said before at the workshop, we either have to use census blocks, precincts, or some combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| I think there's over 4,400 census blocks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| That was way too many to try to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| There's only something like 60 precincts, and that was maybe too few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| So we created something we call building blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| The map on your screen is the building blocks that we chose to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| On the City of Knoxville website, this map is on there as well as a table that goes into each of these blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| and all the data in case anybody is interested in the population and demographics of those blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| These are the blocks we used to try to craft a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| On the screen now is the plan that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| We didn't make very many changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| There's eight changes on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| We started with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| I'll go into this in more depth in a second as to the blowups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| I've got blowups of each of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| We started with the first district mainly because it's a logical place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Councilman Pavlis' district needed to lose population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| We knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| It's not going to be south of the river logically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Fort Sanders is north of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| So we started looking at those precincts north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| All those are fairly large if we get to splitting Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| We were also trying to make sure that we kept neighborhoods together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| So we began to look at the campus and looked at some building blocks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| and found the fraternity row and sorority area in Gibbs Hall and some of the fraternities would be an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| So we tried adding that to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| I think that turned out to be 367 folks that we moved over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Then we applied the deviation to those numbers and that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| That made the first district about where it needed to be a little bit high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| The second district was about where it needed to be and that was a little bit low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| This is the way you develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Once we had those two areas somewhat defined, we said all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| then let's go on to the next important area or the next area we need to look at that maybe has some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| So typically that's always the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| The sixth district is typically low in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| One of our tenets of redistricting had to do with the Voter Rights Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| which is trying to make sure that minority representation is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| So the way we did that in the sixth district was we looked at each of the precincts surrounding the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| and found the highest minority population precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| It turned out to be the Lonsdale area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| So we tried adding, I think that's 26, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| No, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| So we moved 20 into the sixth district and then looked at how that balanced out in the deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| and the minority representation and that seemed to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| So at that point we thought the sixth district looked good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| So now we've got the first, second, and sixth districts, which made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| So then we moved on to the third district, Miss Palmer's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| we all know has gained 5,000 people, so clearly it needed to lose population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| Well, if you have the conclusion that the first and second and sixth districts are good and they're frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| you're not going to go there, you've only got the fifth district to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| And really there's only three precincts touching the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| We chose 41 because it had the most population, it had the best demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| If we went just south of there, that precinct was not nearly large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| If we went north of there, we created a precinct that was not contiguous to other precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| It was not logical to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| So 41 was the logical place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| And I know this is boring stuff, but so we added that to the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| And then all of a sudden, Mr. Thomas' district was too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So we had to find a place to go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Okay, now we've got first, sixth, second, and third frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Well, the fifth district, you know, it can only go toward the fourth district, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| And so we looked, where's a logical place to add to the fourth, and that turned out to be the Fairmont area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| If you just look at the maps and using Broadway as a boundary line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Fairmont seemed to be the 16th and seemed to be the right place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| The population worked out right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| It made the fourth district balance out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| So really, we had a good plan at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Just really those basic changes, we moved Beaumont, we moved the Norwood Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| and we moved Fairmont in the small area of the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| And that pretty much made the plan this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| We were a little surprised that it worked out that easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| It usually does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I mean, there's usually a number of ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Here's the deviation and range based on all the changes we just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| I think it's on the screen, and I think you've got a slide of that in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| We end up with a 7.99% relative deviation, obviously under the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| And it shows the ranges there that went with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Rick, if I can answer your quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| You moved people, not voters, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| It's people, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Does age matter or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Age does not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| So if there's a family of three and one's an infant, it's still three voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| If they were counted in the census, yes, if it was included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| So here is the first change we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| I talked about moving from the first district to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| This is the campus area at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| It's kind of a blowup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| You all have a copy of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| This is also online for anybody that wants to look at this on the cityofknoxville.org website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Volunteer Boulevard, you see some of the dividing lines on there that divided this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| This was not a traditional building block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| We sort of created this one just trying to see where populations were based on some blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| But, again, that seemed to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| This slide is where we moved Beaumont from the 5th district to the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| And, again, you see the dividing lines for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| I know I'm going fairly quickly here, so if anybody has any questions, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Does it say how many bodies are in each of these squares?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| No, but I can tell you, let's see, the campus area was 367 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=574)|
| 0:09:43| Precinct 20, we're looking at right there, was 2952, almost 3,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=583)|
| 0:09:54| And here's the Norwood Library area we took from district 3 and added to district 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| That was 4,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| And, again, just south of there in the 3rd district, how we moved that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| that was only a population of 1,400, so not nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| Here's the Fairmont area, 16N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| And 16N had 3,270 folks we moved from the 5th district to the 4th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=619)|
| 0:10:36| And then the changes we made were more trying to put precincts back together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| that had been split before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| The Lakeshore Commission asked us, while we were doing this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| if we could figure out some way to recombine some precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| So here's an example of a precinct we recombined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| This is the 4th and Gill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| And we moved a part of 6 from district 6 to district 4, 162 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=655)|
| 0:11:06| And, again, when we did this, we were balancing out the numbers all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| to make sure we didn't hurt our standard deviation range or the minority percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| This one was the Holston Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| This was taken out 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| We recombined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| There's 272 people in this district that went from 6 back to 4 where they were years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=682)|
| 0:11:34| And this one is interesting, Callahan Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| This is a result of some annexations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| and the timing of the annexations created an issue where some of it was in the 5th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| some was in the 3rd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Some of it, the part north for Waze was in the 5th and a part south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| It was just really messed up the way it looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| So we put all of Callahan Road area into the 3rd district, I believe is what we did there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=714)|
| 0:12:03| from district 5 to district 3, just to try to clarify that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| And in the future, we have some lawsuits in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| If those areas ever come into the city, then that will be even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| it will be clear where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| We won't have any issues as far as what district is that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| How many people are in that district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| There's nobody in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| That was all just businesses and there's no residents in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| And then the last one was just another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| It's a pet peeve I've had for the whole 20 years I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| This is around the World's Fair side area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| The old line went with an old riverbed before the World's Fair was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| Councilman Dell Bope hit on this a month ago at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| the way these census boundary lines are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And this is an example of an old line that was created 20, 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| The creekbed doesn't exist, hasn't existed in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| But every time we had an event down there at the World's Fair site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Cindy would call and ask, you know, whose district is it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Well, you can see it splits the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| It dodges around somehow or another by the Sun Sphere and the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| We were always trying to make a call as to whose district is that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| So I've always wanted to fix that, so I'm going to take a chance here and fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| and make it the railroad from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| So the railroad will be the new line is what we've tried to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| No population, nobody in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So that's the result of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| But a distinguishable line you can find on the grounds of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| So if you're on the east side of the line and you're in Councilman Brown's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| if you're on the other side, you're in Councilman Pavlis's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| If you're at the Museum of Art, you're in Councilman Pavlis's, for instance, or Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| So basically, that's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Again, we tried to use logic and order to it and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| There's a number of ways you probably could have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| But again, we started with that first district, and it just sort of built on itself as we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| Had we started somewhere else instead of there, it may have gone a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Again, there's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Here's the final numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Again, the 8% range, 178,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| The other interesting thing here, the 6th district had a total minority population of 59% to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| We were at 58% by this plan, which I was not sure we could do, but we were able to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| We don't seem to have that chart, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| It's on the second half of the 2011 Knoxville City Council redistricting page 2 of our handout today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| The right-hand side of that has the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Okay. All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Yeah, thank you, Ms. Balmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| But that pretty much concludes it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| If anybody has any questions or comments, I'm sure the public will want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| At this point, if you all agree with the plan, then I guess it goes to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| All right, this is a public hearing, and for the benefit of the public, we don't have anyone signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Is there anyone in the audience who would like to come forward and speak to this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| Okay, since we don't have anybody, if council would like to have a discussion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| I guess we can move with Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I'd like to thank Mr. Emmett and everyone else who was involved in preparing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| I think that a lot of people anticipated some pain and agony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| This has appeared to be fairly painless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Precinct 41 has been moved to a different district from 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| and my conversations with the people in that district are very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| I've heard nothing negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| And in a couple of the other situations, I've had positive feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| So that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Councilman Dela Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Yes, thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Yeah, I also wanted to thank Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I'm sure we all do for the hard work he put into this and to try to get it right and simple and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| That is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Maybe you don't know the answer to this, but if you went way back in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| how did we design the precinct lines before your time and our time, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| I mean, how were they born?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| We're trying to preserve precincts as best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| but what was the decision-making process back then, or does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| I mean, is it gone, gone forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| I mean, my guess would be that as the city has grown, you know, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| I mean, we started with, you know, 20 acres or something back many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| and you had a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| And then as it grew, the election commissions, I guess, divided it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| and I don't know what the logic would be to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| You said we had 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| How many did we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| However many acres we had many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I've got a history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| No, no, the precincts, the number of precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Of precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Yeah, there's 40-some precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I think it's 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| 46 precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| And the election commission determines those lines today, and they split precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| and we don't really have a, I don't know that we have a role in the way the precincts are formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| It has to be based on census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| So I'm not sure what the answer to that is, how we got to where we are with all the precinct lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| But I do appreciate the fact that you tried to straighten out some of the lines so that you can fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| In other words, I remember going up Broadway and trying to decide if this block or that block was in or out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| and this way you've got very natural boundaries in most areas to try to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| So that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Vice Mayor or either Mr. Swanson, when this has to be, we have to approve a plan by a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| and we discussed it, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| We're going to put this in the form of an ordinance, and it will probably be before the council in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| which our goal was to have this completed by June the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| which is when the applications for the upcoming council races, especially the 5th district, are due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| I see. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Yes, just a question for Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| My only concern is are we fairly confident that the public knows about the plan and what the changes are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| I know there was an excellent article, I thought, in the New Sentinel that was quite detailed to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| but I just wondered, has there been some outreach more to the public to make sure that they are aware of these proposed changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| We're having the public hearing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Other than that, we've announced it over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| It's on all the websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I actually have spoken to the TV stations a few times myself about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| They don't seem to have any interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I don't quite know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I'm a little surprised at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Other than that, we haven't tried to send out any mailings or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| I'm not sure what else we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Have you heard anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Has your office heard much from the public about pros or cons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| I have had zero discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| No one has called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I've run into people on the street, and they've had a few comments, and always positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I haven't heard anything negative about it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Okay, with no other comments or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you, Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| I failed to thank MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Tim Coon and Alex Zindel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Actually, Alex works for Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| He did almost all this planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I would hate to not recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| He did a great job on it, and Tim helped him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| So I failed to mention him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| They did really good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Would you repeat again that website in case anyone is listening so they can go there and go to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| CityofKnoxville.org, the city's main website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| And is there then a banner or a flag that sends them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| What do they look for when they get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| It's one of the very first paragraphs there, and it's redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Do they click on that and see all of these maps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| There's links for every single thing we have up there and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And then it also links to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| The data is on MPC's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| It's also on the Election Commission's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| And I think they've got a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Is it KnoxRedistricting.org, I believe, that the Election Commission has actually set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| So there's a lot of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| All the data is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Actually, more data than we presented is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| So any of those three places, they can find the actual map and figure out where they fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And, again, the new Sentinel, and Mr. Thomas mentioned this earlier, link to all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Ms. Farrar wrote the article a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| So I don't really know why there's not been any interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| But thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419redistricting?start=1249)|
