| 0:00:00| At our council meeting, I'd like to ask everybody to rise and ask Ms. Pelow if she'll lead us in the invocation, and Mr. Frost if he'll lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=0)|

| 0:00:13| Our Father, we're grateful for the many blessings that you have bestowed upon us and upon our community, upon our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=13)|
| 0:00:26| We are so grateful for the opportunities that are ours, for the freedoms that are ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=26)|
| 0:00:33| And often we forget to thank you for the challenges that you put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| We are so grateful for our safety, our comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| And today, during that incredible rain, which didn't last long, it brought to mind how grateful we should be that we have not endured the tragic storms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=46)|
| 0:01:00| and the tragic events that have destroyed so many people's lives and homes and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=60)|
| 0:01:08| We pray your blessings upon those who are suffering through those terrible events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=68)|

| 0:02:17| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Ms. Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Mayor Haslam, I would like to request postponement for item number 11N for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| 11N for two weeks, that is the item dealing with the investment policy of the City of Knoxville Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| Thank you, Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| I, for one, was going to ask several questions about this tonight and had some points of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| confusion, so I appreciate some time to consider this further and learn more about these complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Well, it was my understanding there were some questions, and it seemed wise to let everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| have an opportunity to feel comfortable before it came to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| The motion seconded to postpone 11N for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Any other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| And I don't believe we have any consent items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| So, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| A real quick Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| We're well into our role as a solar American city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| The 2009 solar tour and fair on Saturday in Crouch Park had a great crowd and gave folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| a chance to learn about the opportunities for solar technology in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| There were 15 sites on the tour, ranging from houses to a horse barn, each demonstrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| how we're currently using solar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| So, thanks to everyone who worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| It's also a privilege to announce that the long-awaited opening of the SNW is less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| two weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| A lot of folks in here worked hard to make that a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| And the press conference and ribbon-cutting will be October 17th at 1, and there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| be an open house there on the 18th, and they will open for business on Monday, the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| So, hopefully everybody can make one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| I'm not certain that there's been a more discussed building in Knoxville over the last however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| It closed back in 1981, and I think after 28 years, we're ready for it to be a new symbol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| of downtown's renaissance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| So, thanks for everybody that helped on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| And then the third annual Cross Knox 15K and 5K walk is this Sunday at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| It starts at Alex Haley Statue in Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| It will go all the way to Bearden Elementary, and almost every step of the way from East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Knoxville to West Knoxville takes place on the city's greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I know a couple of years ago, City Council had a relay team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Are we thinking about reprising that role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I don't see any heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Actually, Mr. Becker is going to run it by himself this year, representing Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Anyway, for those who are interested, it really is a fun chance to see the greenways and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| lot of the extension across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| And, again, it starts at 3 Alex Haley Statue in Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Reports of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| I've been working in inner city ministry for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| And over the years, frequently, ministries and churches have attempted to collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| and work together, and with some success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| But I would have to say that the most successful venture out there is an organization called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Compassion Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| And they have a document that they've just released called the Salt and Light Guidebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| And it's a guide to loving Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Their Compassion Coalition mission is to inform, prepare, and unite churches and ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| to transform the lives and communities in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| And this is a stunning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| And I recommend this document to all my colleagues on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Great maps, data, most current census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| If you want to know where the pockets of poverty are in your district, you can find out by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| looking in this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| I've asked Grant Standifer, who is the Executive Director of Compassion Coalition, to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| and introduce this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| We spent about three years working on this book, all 456 pages of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| And we've had focus groups and done extensive work and research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| And as Councilman Woodhull has already said, there are about 600 churches in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| There are over 113,000 folks who profess in affiliation with a church in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And so there are incredible resources, incredible resources to make a difference in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| if we can somehow marshal those resources and begin to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| And this is one of the tools that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| In Section 1, there are 28 chapters that deal, really have to deal a lot with the brokenness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| There's a chapter on domestic violence and abuse or what it means to be homeless in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| or what it means to be a prostitute in Knoxville or what it means to be an immigrant in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| In each one of these chapters, there is statistical data about the realities of what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| to be a victim of domestic violence and abuse in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| But then in each one of those chapters is also a story, a glimpse in the life of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| we've actually interviewed someone in Knoxville living in that particular context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| But there's also a story of hope where we talk about how people, the good people of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Knoxville have come alongside someone in that situation and made a difference in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| And then I think one of the most helpful aspects of the guidebook is that at the end of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| one of those chapters, we have sought to compile a list of every possible agency, organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| ministry, non-profit, faith-based non-profit, website addresses, contact information, telephone numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| email addresses, descriptions, so that when people are touched by these respective stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| then they have a place where they can connect and where they can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| So, of course, one of the other things that Councilman Woodhull talked about was the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| historically have not worked very well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| We've worked independently of one another, but there's a whole section in here on collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| and how we can work together for the good of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| So this is available for the citizens of our community, and I brought a box of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| and Councilman Woodhull has a box of these for any city council person who would like a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| It is a complimentary copy for you if you would like one and if you would find it useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| So we're here to serve our community and the people of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Grant, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Is there a telephone service that Compassion Coalition provides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| Yes, we have a clearinghouse for people in need who can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| We receive about 4,000 calls a year into our clearinghouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| and this last year we made 2,061 referrals to community agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=567)|

| 0:09:43| Grant, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Grant has brought a book, a copy of that, by to my office a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Grant, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| I'm sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| No, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| He brought a copy by a couple of weeks ago, and if you want to take a deep dive into the different agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| that are really helping around Knoxville with folks who know what they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I didn't mean to get into it, and about 30 minutes later I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| I need to go back to my job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| So I got to finish it over the weekend, and you guys have done great work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| and we're very grateful for everything you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=610)|

| 0:10:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| I was interrupting you because he was interrupting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| You have a radio program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=620)|

| 0:10:28| I interview someone in the community who is working in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and I allow them to tell their story and what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| and how they're working in the community and how listeners to that particular show can engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| with that ministry or that nonprofit or that agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and how they can make a difference in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| So that's Monday afternoon at 5 on Joy 620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=648)|

| 0:10:55| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Yes, I'm glad to hear about that publication because over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| I've used a similar publication called Salt and Light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| and it does much of the same kind of stuff you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I think it was done by First Baptist in Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| It looks like yours is more expansive than that one, so I look forward to using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Actually, this is Salt and Light, only it looks a little different because it is much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Version 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Even more delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| I wanted to say that I'm honored to announce that the Carpetbag Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and this weekend it will have various programs starting, oh, gee, on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=694)|
| 0:11:46| Well, starting on the 8th, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| But the main program is going to be at the Botanical Gardens all day Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| and everybody in the city is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| They're going to have various musical combos playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| and excerpts from plays and activities for children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| and I'm going to even take my hi-fi equipment out there and play much of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| big band sounds and rhythm and blues and pop music and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So come on out to the Knoxville Botanical Gardens starting at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| Activities end at 8 p.m., so we'd like to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| As your unofficial DJ partner, I'm hurt that you didn't ask me to be your partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| but I'll get over it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Well, Bill, you and I did a duet the last time I remember we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| and I haven't seen the video yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I'm hoping there's not a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| To be clear, Bill won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Just a Vice Mayor announcement, reminding people Thursday, October 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| 5 o'clock workshop on wayfinding, and then Thursday, November 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| 5 o'clock workshop on recycling in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| two upcoming truly thrilling workshops that I'm looking forward to seeing everybody at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Is that an old light or a new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Okay, thanks, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointments of Kim Wood McClamrock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and Dr. Michael Blackwell to the Knoxville-Knox County Animal Welfare Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| 10A is an appeal by Parisa Kadkoda of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| to deny a variance to reduce the front yard setback from 25 feet to 24.5 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Article 4, Section 2.1.1.E.1.A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| as per site plan, to convert an existing garage into a detached dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| in an R1 low-density residential district property located at 126 Stone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| in conjunction with 11-0, which is a resolution approving the appeal of Parisa Kadkoda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| I'm going to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| There's a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| As folks sign up to speak, and I will ask you to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| I think you're speaking in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I'm Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Because there's actually a motion to deny, I think parliamentarily we would switch the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| I think we went through this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I think it stays this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| The original appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| My name is Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I live in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| My address is Suite 1600 in Plaza Tower here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| I represent the interests of Bahman, Cassaray, and Parisa Kadkoda with respect to a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| of property that is located at 126 Stone Road here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| This is a request for a variance to permit them to have a front-line setback along Stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| Road, reducing the setback requirement from 25 feet to 24.5 feet, which means a six-inch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| There's a number of things that I think this council should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| The first thing that I believe it should consider is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| At the present time, the building actually lies a minimum of 54.5 feet from Stone Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=928)|
| 0:15:38| and between a minimum of 24.5 feet and a maximum of 29 feet on the surface of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| that faces Stone Road from what apparently is an existing 30-foot right-of-way along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Now, the reason that that right-of-way is 30 feet wide from the center section of Stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| Road is because this existing building lies on a parcel of property that was re-subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=960)|
| 0:16:13| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| It was re-subdivided because it's a cinder block structure and it's a vacant garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| which Mr. Cassaray and his wife, Ms. Kadkoda, are converting into a residential piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=986)|
| 0:16:38| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| In order to do that, they had to re-subdivide a prior plat of property, which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| And according to the surveyor who surveyed the plat for re-subdivision as a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1007)|
| 0:16:56| of that re-subdivision so that they could perform the renovation of the property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| turn it into an income-producing property, they were required to dedicate, without cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| to the city or county, an additional five feet of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| So, what they did was they dedicated a five-foot right-of-way extension to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| that was along Stone Road in order to do this improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| They then platted the property, but as a result of that dedication, they were six inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1047)|
| 0:17:37| short of the setback line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Had they not dedicated the five feet, they'd have been four and a half feet back from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| setback line and in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| The other thing that I think is important to recognize on this is the requested variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1069)|
| 0:17:59| is absolutely consistent with the neighborhood along Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| And if you go out and look at Stone Road from this piece of property to Magazine Road, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| is a half mile down the road on that side of the property, what you are going to find, and I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| out and shot this with a laser today, and I'm not a surveyor, but I got to looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| property with my clients and I'm going, you know, there are a lot of buildings on this road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| are very, very close to this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| And I went out and shot it with a laser and here's what I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Between 126 Stone Road and Magazine Road, there are 21 other residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| Of those 21 residents, two are three feet further away from Stone Road than this existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1129)|
| 0:18:59| Two are nine feet further away from Stone Road than this existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| Seventeen of the 21 buildings are closer to the edge of Stone Road than 126 Stone Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1148)|
| 0:19:18| which is this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And of those 17 residences that were closer, over half were more than 15 feet closer than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1160)|
| 0:19:31| building would be with the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Because over half of the buildings which are in this location are going to be closer to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| than an existing building, the footprint is not changing, the foundation is not changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| the exterior walls are not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| The building's been there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| It is perfectly consistent with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| It is consistent with all of the houses that are along Stone Road on that side of its street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| And there's even a house that's 24 feet closer that is existing and is presently occupied beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1209)|
| 0:20:22| In order to get the resubdivision so that they could do the residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| they had to dedicate a five-foot addition to the right-of-way on Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And because of that dedication of that five-foot addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| they're now six inches from meeting the zoning requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| when the zoning requirement doesn't apply to virtually any of the houses along that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| And as a result of that, I would respectfully ask that the court or the court, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| In this case, you are the court, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| But that the council go ahead and approve the request and allow these parties to go ahead and complete their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1260)|
| 0:21:10| which, by the way, at the moment, it's worthless as far as the tax rolls are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| and it will increase revenue to both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Signed up to speak against is Terry Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Terry Carruthers, 6102 Arcadia Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Council members, you know from previous interactions with the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| and with the Colonial Village residents that one of our primary goals is to strive for owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| single-family homes in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Because absentee landlords and tenants, who by their very nature are transient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| in that they are not in a neighborhood for long term, lack vested interests in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| Studies indicate that rental properties in existing neighborhoods lower property values and increase crime rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1325)|
| 0:22:15| Granting this variance at 126 Stone Road will create more of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| and the residents of Colonial Village and the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| are having enough difficulty attempting to see that these owner's properties at 130 Stone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| are in compliance with city codes and ordinances without the additional onus of the property at 126 Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1353)|
| 0:22:42| What we have here are not individuals who own and are operating these properties for investment purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1362)|
| 0:22:52| What we have are individuals who own and are operating these properties for the exploitation of profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| and there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Why else would the neighborhood residents constantly see multiple cars on the 130 Stone Road property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| and the 126 Stone Road property at all hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| Why else would we know by the owner's own admission that there are at least six students residing at the 130 Stone Road property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1394)|
| 0:23:25| Why else would the interior of the 130 Stone Road property be cut and subdivided to create additional living spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1405)|
| 0:23:34| Why else would they be seeking to turn the 126 Stone Road garage into additional rental property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| What we have here are individuals who are trying to create a mini apartment complex in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1422)|
| 0:23:52| In regard to the variance, the zoning board said no and questioned why MPC permitted the property to be subdividing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1432)|
| 0:24:02| when the existing structure did not meet the legal requirements for setback, calling it, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| a tremendous mistake by MPC in granting the plat based on the circumstance that it was going to create a nonconforming structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| on the plat, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| So now we are here asking you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Because these applicants created their own hardship by requesting to subdivide this property to generate additional rental income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| But according to the recent history of the property presented by Anita Cash at the August 20th Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| the owners had exhibited a repeated blatant disregard for city codes and ordinances by doing unpermitted work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| and by the number of renters on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| At this August hearing, the owner admitted the garage was converted to a single-family residence, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| three to four months ago, unquote, placing the conversion in April or May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| The owner additionally admitted not having a permit to modify the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Also, the owner admitted the house was currently rented to six students and, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| he did not see a problem with it, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| According to the timeline presented at the Board of Zoning Appeal, on April 17th, this structure was inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| and the owner warned it had the, quote, appearance of being cut for possible student room rental, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| The owner responded that he was aware of the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| So then the question becomes, since the owner admits knowledge of this regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| then why was there this appearance that was questioned by the inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and why has he cut and rented the 130 Stone Road property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Also, according to this timeline, plans were not submitted for review in regard to this conversion until June 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| a conversion that was done in April or May by the owner's own admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| For five to seven years, there have been repeated code and ordinance violations with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| that the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association and the residents of Stone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| have tried to go through codes and the 311 to try and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| It is very frustrating not only for the residents on Stone Road but for the neighborhood at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| Approving this variance of a mere six inches rewards these owners for continuous wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| They continue on in their blatant disregard of the process, the codes, and the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| It says you don't have to play by the rules, just ask for forgiveness afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| If you grant this appeal, you will create another piece of unregulated rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| for an absentee landlord that will negatively impact our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| and fly in the face of what the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association seeks to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| a sense of community through responsible, owner-occupied, single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| Now, I'd like to have some residents from the Colonial Village Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and the Neighborhood Association who are in opposition, if you would please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| We implore you, Council, to deny the appeal of this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Help us keep our neighborhood R1, low-density, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Please deny the appeal and do not create another piece of unregulated rental property in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Also, you've been provided with a copy of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| and there is notation that these photos were taken after cleanups, after repeated calls to 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| And if you will notice in the lower corner on the right, there is a car that is parked on the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| and this is because when there are so many cars pulled in that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| the students park in the grass so that they'll be able to exit out the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you very much for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Sir, by rules, you have two minutes to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Mr. Frost, did you have a question now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| If you want to outlaw students, you know how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| If you want to outlaw people who develop property in Knoxville, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| and you want to send a message to people who develop property for profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| that they're not allowed to make a profit, they're not allowed to do that in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| then you know how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| What is requested is consistent with every piece of property within a half a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1743)|
| 0:29:15| of this particular piece of property going south to Magazine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| And it's six inches, and it's six inches where if there was a 25-foot right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| which is applicable to the rest of the road instead of a 30-foot right-of-way that was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| by this property owner in order to re-subdivide the property so that they could comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| with your rules, regulations under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| I mean, they give you the extension in order to comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1789)|
| 0:29:58| and then they're six inches off from the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| There's at least 15 houses beside them that are off from the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| And what we hear is, we don't want rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Even if it's detached, single-unit rental property, we don't want landlords in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1814)|
| 0:30:24| And I would submit to you, and they've also talked about absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Well, if they mean absentee landlords, people who don't live directly in that neighborhood, I agree with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| because Parisa Kadkota and Ben Cassaray don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| But despite their names, they live in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| And if absentee landlord means anybody who doesn't live beside the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| then they're absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| But otherwise, that is misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| And I would once again strongly recommend what you've basically heard is the real reason that these people are opposed to this variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| and that is they don't want renters and they don't want students in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| And I would submit to you that that is not an appropriate way or appropriate reason to deny this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1868)|
| 0:31:19| We haven't heard a good reason to deny the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| And quite frankly, if it's a question of code enforcement on an adjacent piece of property, they haven't addressed 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| They've addressed 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| There's nothing that indicates if they're having years and years of trouble, I understand, enforcing the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| What that would seem to indicate is maybe it's in compliance, because if it's not in compliance, codes will be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I think I have a question for Ms. Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Well, first, as you come up, let me ask Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Did we originally have a situation where this one lot was large enough that it could be administratively subdivided pursuant to state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1918)|
| 0:32:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| A new lot was created from a single larger lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Ms. Carruthers, let's try to help focus here and help me better understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| What we have is an issue over six inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| I certainly understand what you're saying about, you know, your concern and the different neighbors' concerns about who your neighbors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1946)|
| 0:32:36| and how, you know, they maintain their property because it affects those around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Let's focus down on this six-inch issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Can I interject something very quickly, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| First of all, we are not against renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| We have several rental homes in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| They are inhabited by single families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| We also have rental homes that are by two UT students living together or three UT students living together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| Students and rentals are not the primary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| The primary issue is the non-observance of the city codes and the city ordinances on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2000)|
| 0:33:30| and on the adjoining property at 126 Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I can tell you that approximately two to three years ago, there were 15 to 20 people living on the Stone Road properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2013)|
| 0:33:42| the 126 and the 130 combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| An extension cord ran power out to the garage on 126 Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| And you'd go by there every night and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| And there were 20 to 25 cars parked in on the two driveways and on the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| Now, that is a mini apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| And that is what we're opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| I'm trying to help you hone and let's focus your issue because what was it the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2050)|
| 0:34:20| and what is before city council tonight is the issue of whether or not this six inches should make or break this proposed house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2060)|
| 0:34:33| I know they're important to you, but we're not really getting into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Everybody definitely is hearing you about your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| But what we're talking about tonight, we're limited to talking about tonight, is the six-inch issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| Help without we've heard your other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Help us understand why this six-inch issue is important to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| It essentially creates more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| If they're able to operate one home and not operate it within codes and ordinances, then how are they going to operate two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2101)|
| 0:35:13| I have someone else from the neighborhood that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Yes, I'd like to hear from Mr. Tuchton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| My name is Joe Tuchton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| I live in Colonial Village, and I am a land surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| I appreciate this fellow's talk about the roads on Stone Road, the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| I've ridden my bicycle up and down that thing three or four hundred times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And as close as I can tell, they not only meet the requirements for the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| but they meet the requirements for the building setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| That's somehow missed this whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| This building is not only in the right-of-way, it doesn't meet the front yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| This is the old office building for the quarry, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| And it's been there before, you know, Stone Road is named because there was a quarry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| So the thing is not just the six inches it's sticking in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| but also the 25 feet of front yard setback that's gone, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| So it's not, I mean, we're not addressing the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Let me ask you this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| How long would you approximate the building we're discussing having been there, 50, 60 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| Easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| Wouldn't it be, I mean, over time setbacks change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| All the time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| But, I mean, isn't it possible that at one time that that building was, had the proper setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| At the time of that building, there probably were no setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| But then when the setback or the law was changed, doesn't that become a preexisting nonconforming use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| But it's all right as long as you don't try to make it something better than it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| We have nonconforming uses all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| The problem comes is when you want to do something today, now you have to meet today's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| As long as you leave it alone and like it was built in 1910 or something, everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| And I've seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| I've been a land surveyor for 35, 38 years, something like that, 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| And I've seen this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And, you know, it's like, well, I really don't, you know, you could just push this garage down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| and move it 25 feet off the right-of-way and build another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Now, there's a good solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| And, theoretically, that's what we ought to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| But it always comes down to this when somebody wants to just keep what's there and get around the existing codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2284)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I need to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| But we have our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| And unless somebody from council wants to call on you, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| But there's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| We still have our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| So if somebody from council would like to call on me, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Yeah, I would like to hear what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Mr. Hall, I'm sorry, but we're not quite a court, but we do have rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And I don't mean to violate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| The building we're talking about is 20 yards off the border of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| It's 60 feet away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| The building that this gentleman is addressing is the building next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| That's not the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| And I would respectfully point out we're not talking about what they're referring to as 130 and I believe is actually 122.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| It is 24 feet off the roadway and is a foot in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| But that is not the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And I don't want this council to believe that it's the building we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| We're talking about a building that is 20 yards away from the side of the road, not the middle of the road, but the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| There's a 30-foot section that is dedicated to the roadway, which is the widest section, we are told, of right-of-way on Stone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2370)|
| 0:39:43| And five feet of that right-of-way was dedicated in order to get this subdivision or this resubdivision done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| If the property had not been resubdivided and brought into conformance with the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| it meets the front yard setback rule by four and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| And once again, what I would ask the council to focus on is what does this six inches mean on a building that is at least 54.6 feet off of the side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2404)|
| 0:40:20| If you look at the white line along the shoulder of the road, it's at least that, and it's 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| And I understand and I sympathize with the gentleman because you look at that house next door, and it is a preexisting use, and it is a lot closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2428)|
| 0:40:39| It's 24 feet closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| But that's not the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| And if it is the property, if he thinks it's the property we're talking about, that's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| If council would like to see what the yardage in terms of the setback from the line is on these various properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| I have the addresses and how far back they are off the road, and I'd certainly be happy to present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2457)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Any other questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2473)|

| 0:43:20| Is it we always use Harleys, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| Well, we have with the last we have for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Before that, we had Kawasaki's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2609)|

| 0:43:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Lease operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Well, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I know Councilman Hall would know a lot more about this than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| but I was just curious if we were stuck on one brand or how we were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| There is some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Obviously, there is discussion when you change because there are differences in different types of bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| I know at the time this was done, the fleet management talked with our motor officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| and our motor supervisors and our administration and did some tests and checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| and arrived at the decision to use that particular brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| Don't catch Councilman Hall in a conflict of interest situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I just wanted to see what he had to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Actually, I wish I could lease one for that amount for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| I mean, that's a deal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knox Housing Partnership, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| to provide $40,000 in community development block grant funding for home buyer pre-purchase counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| and to develop a pipeline of eligible home buyers for homes built by Knox Housing Partnership, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| I had a question for Ms. O'Hara about this, and I didn't have a chance to connect with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| I'd like to know more about developing the pipeline of buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| and an assurance that KHP's programs will make sure that we're putting qualified buyers in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| that we know can stay in these homes long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Well, they're here if you'd like them to speak to that directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| but that is the purpose here is to, you know, part of this is to provide counseling for many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| but particularly because they do build homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| they want to make sure that they're creating a pipeline of qualified buyers who understand what they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| that when they buy a home, what the responsibilities are and the financial issues related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| I guess my question is that we must be having trouble finding qualified buyers to use these funds to assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| and so it's necessary to pay a staffer to go out and do community education to try to develop that pool of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| You know, we have for many years funded a home buyer education class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| so they've done similar work for this for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Actually, I should probably call on Jackie Mayo, the Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| who can explain more about the challenges right now related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Jackie, if you could come down and give us your name and title and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2780)|
| 0:46:30| Jackie Mayo, Executive Director of Knox Housing Partnership, 404 Ferret Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| So, my question is, when we have federal funds like this available to us to assist first-time home buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| explain to me the need to hire someone to go out and find those buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| There just are not enough people already interested in the, I understand the home buyer education piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| I guess I'm curious to know more about the recruitment of buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| I think in the current market right now, in the downturn, we've had trouble getting people qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| So, this pipeline would be to work with folks in the community that we're building in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| Right now we're building in Park City, Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| We'll be going to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| So, trying to look out in those areas, bring people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| and work with them individually in a housing counseling plan to create a consistent pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| so that as we're building homes, because we have money that we need to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| help the city spend to build houses that HUD is issuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| So, we need that pipeline ready for when the houses are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| How long does it typically take once you locate someone who might be a potential buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| to help them develop either the savings habits or the down payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| or the wherewithal to be able to apply and get into your program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Is it a several-year process to prepare a potential, in terms of developing this pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| Everybody's an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| So, we triage in near ready, short term, and long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Long term would be 12 months and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| So, we see a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| We do financial literacy classes every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And then for those that are near ready, we can go ahead and put them into home buyer education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| We create an action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| So, each person is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| We've seen people get in there very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| We had a lady close today on House EA in five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| We're very excited about that because the market's tough right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Lending requirements have really, really tightened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So, we're trying to get people into market loans so that there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| we've never advocated people doing the other loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| So, that's not our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| So, we're trying to keep people in good loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| But there's a lot of folks that have some credit issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And the other issue is income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| We've got lots of modest income folks that want to be homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| We've just got to help them find a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| I think that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knox Housing Partnership, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| to support the Park City Home Energy Improvement Program utilizing $304,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| in community development block grant recovery funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| as authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Ms. Roddigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Sorry, I'm the one with the questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| I guess this is for Ms. Rojero again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Looking at Exhibit A on page 27, which is the projected budget for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| talk to me about the amount of overhead that's needed to administer this particular grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| or this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| I guess I was concerned about the percent of the total budget that's going toward personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Is it particularly a personnel-heavy project to get this going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| Again, I will defer to the person who manages this with KHP, which is Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3003)|
| 0:50:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| The personnel line item in this budget will cover not only the project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| for intake and screening of applicants for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| because this is an owner-occupied energy retrofit program for people already in homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| So there will be an intake process, a screening process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| There will be a project manager that will have to oversee the actual work in the field as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| And so that's basically what that covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| You know, when I did the math, I came up with a little over 27% in terms of overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| and I guess I need to understand more about how that wasn't overhead, but maybe vision long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| It seems like a high percent of the total grant amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| It's not necessarily considered overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| It's project delivery costs, because without the staff to implement the project, it couldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| So although it is staffing time, it's part of the project delivery cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And what's the timeline for this project, again, to completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| This is funded with ARRA dollars, so we have three years to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| But I believe this is a one-year, two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| It's 35 homes, and we gave them two years to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| They feel like they can do that a lot quicker, but we've set up the timeline for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you, Jackie, while you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Since this is focused on energy-efficient structures, there's a reference in the project description to LEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| but these will not be LEED certified structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| I believe that's correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| These are existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Yeah, it's hard to get an existing up to LEED, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| You said that there's a project manager on your staff that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Well, we have project managers for every one of our sub-recipient contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| That money is not included in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| I was speaking about the Knox Housing Partnership project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Their project manager, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| That's what I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| That project manager, and you may not be the one to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| but I'm curious to know what level of training they have as far as implementing the energy-efficiency measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| that are going to be part of this development because that's really critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Somebody really has to know their stuff to be able to do that job well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| and oversee contractors that do it because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| if the contractors aren't certified in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| then there's a higher level of uncertainty in terms of whether or not they'll be able to perform adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Ken Block is the project manager, and he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| I can't speak to his exact qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| He may want to come up and talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| I will add, as he's coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| he was the manager for the construction of the seven LEED gold homes that are in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| Well, he may want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Come on in if you want to again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| I mean, that certainly says something if he's had that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| He has experience in working with energy-efficiency projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| The chief provides the construction of seven LEED homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| That says a lot right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I'm Ken Block, Knox Housing Partnership, and I'm the project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| I'm a LEED AP for homes and actually a resident HRS rater as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| I'm going to supervise the project manager on this project too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| I had the HRS rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| That's the third-party certification special training and testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| and that's the home energy rating system, I believe, is what the HRS is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Well, that's our test-in, test-out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| We're going to test in these houses before we do our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| and then obviously quantify what the outcomes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| You don't do thermal surveys, I assume, but you probably do blower door infiltration tests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| We'll do blower door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We'll do duct blaster for the infiltration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Where in Park Ridge is this occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Is it in the model block that KHP was involved in a number of years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| It's in the general area where the LEED houses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| that general area near the Williams Creek area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Okay, so much further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Now, I mean, this is going to be like I personally had the energy right home survey done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| This is going to be much more extensive testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| Yes, the TVA testing doesn't include the blower door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| and there may be others that you want to address, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| I mean, like the TVA program is $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| What's the approximate cost of this program for one house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3336)|
| 0:55:45| We're expecting, on average, I think about $4,800 of hard construction costs is going to go into each house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3345)|
| 0:55:58| We've got a training component in there for, I should call, green technicians that are learning the trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3358)|
| 0:56:09| green infiltration, remediation, repairs for this type of older home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3369)|
| 0:56:25| So the approximate cost of the improvements to each home is around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| Around $4,800 on average now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| It obviously can vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| And these homes have already been selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| We've got to go out and visit in the community, find out who's qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| That's part of the staff expense that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| We're going to look at where is the most cost-effective use for the resources that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| We also have a big component of this is the community education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| One of the things that we experience with the houses down on Chestnut, those five lead houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| as we're building there, frequently the neighbors would walk up and ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| is this the houses that have $50 utility bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| And I'd have to correct them and say, no, it's more like 80 to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| These houses, on average, that we built out there are going to consume about 11,000 kilowatt hours annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3448)|
| 0:57:39| A week later, someone would come up from the neighborhood and ask, is this a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| Are these the houses that have no energy costs, utility costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| The point being that the community was very aware that this type of efficiency was accessible to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3471)|
| 0:58:04| We're looking here to help in educating how the lowest hanging fruit that are available for these homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3484)|
| 0:58:14| some of which they can do themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| The most basic is replacing your incandescent lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I don't want to get me started on the building systems here, and we'll be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3512)|

| 1:01:25| southwest side of I-270.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I would like to move to approve this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| And, Madeline, could you explain why that's necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Yes, thank you, Councilman Woodhull and Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| The reason why we're asking that these be put on emergency, the next three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| is that they're all related to the Lonsdale Redevelopment Project that you all approved so many meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| And you may recall back in July you all passed a resolution for us that asked NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| to actually expedite these plan amendments so that we could move forward that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| in a more timely manner in order to meet the deadlines for the Empowerment Zone funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| So that's why we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| As you can see, there wasn't any opposition at the NPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| and this will save us probably a good two weeks or so to be able to move the project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3738)|

| 1:02:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| I picked up on that when I was going through the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Wouldn't the process have been better to do the rezoning before allocating the money first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| in case the rezoning didn't work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Because it seems like we're now, we've got a commitment for the money when the zoning changes hadn't passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| Well, the reason, in a perfect world probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| but the reason why the property owner didn't want to do the rezoning before is that if the funding wasn't approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| then he wouldn't be able to move forward on the project either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Councilman Woodhull, would you accept a friendly amendment to your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| If we're trying to expedite this, if we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Just for clarification, right now probably what we have on the floor is a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| We then need to have a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| I know he said that, but we probably, actually, first we need a motion to approve and then a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So I'm going to take Mr. Woodhull's and the second as a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Somebody at some point needs to move to amend to do it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| I'll make a motion to amend it to emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Approval on emergency and also the other part of my amendment will be to change Section 3 to say it will take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| immediately upon passage instead of 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| So it just expedites it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| If we're going to expedite, let's expedite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Yeah, I think emergency does that, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Does that take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I wasn't sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| The motion on the floor right now is to amend to emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091006?start=3842)|
