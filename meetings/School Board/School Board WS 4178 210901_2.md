| 3:40:31| where if a student hasn't done that to take it home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| obviously the principal and the teacher are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| working with that family, and if a quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| situation or an isolation situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| would arise, you know, we would just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| them to sign that paper to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| But outside of that, you know, we continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| follow up and try to make that happen, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| we're not, you know, saying, sorry, you didn't sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| You know, no, we're trying to get that. When they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| to pick the student up and come get the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| they can still do that, and we're trying to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| So, on the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| or the internet. Hey, John, let me ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| a question, too. In absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| of approval of this policy, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| does it mean? I mean, what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| different? If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| didn't have this policy, what would be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13267)|
| 3:41:09| Without this policy in place, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| we're not able to provide virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| to students who are isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| or quarantined. Okay, but in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| excused absence, how do I make that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| if we don't have it. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| Isn't it going to be the same process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13283)|
| 3:41:25| Right. So, I would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| back to, you know, our expectation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| to continue to use Canvas and have that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| make-up piece, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| If somebody's out for strep throat, or they're just out for a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| days doing something like that, same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| situation. Students traditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| have just missed instruction for those three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| days, and then when they come back, they work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| the teacher to work out a make-up plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| you know, have a reasonable time. Typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| the policy says three days, but usually they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| work around that. I guess what I was trying to get at, in absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| of this policy, the make-up piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| is still the same, the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13315)|
| 3:42:01| And in light to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| changes, we've kind of fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| the hotspot program back up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| for lack of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| better option. So, we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| communicating that last week to our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| that this is available, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| we have some funds to support that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| this year, but it's still not the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| option for our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| but we do have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13343)|
| 3:42:27| Anything else, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| On the currency, but Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| Henderson has a question. Okay, go ahead, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| Yeah, I just want to, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| with Ms. Owen on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| this. I've heard this from so many of my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| and principals that they are drowning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| here, and they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| need a time frame on this, and they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| time to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| up and running, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| I'm trying to fight for the teachers and principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| because they're with our kids every day, and they really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| wondering, and I know Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| McMillan has a question, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| we don't pass, back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| Mr. Thomas said, if we don't pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| this policy right now, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| then basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13391)|
| 3:43:13| kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| out would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| just come back to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| and get their work as they normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| would. Is that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Mr. Thomas? Well, based on what John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| just talked about, the expectation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| they would still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| the teachers, and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| trying to throw extra work on teachers, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| again, we've always had make-up when students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| are absent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13415)|
| 3:43:37| excused absences, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| this is the procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| I don't know, John, what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| I guess when the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| gets back, the teacher is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| going to be work to try to go back for the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| of days that that particular student was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| absent to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| the make-up. Exactly right, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| again, the whole reason that this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| change has to be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| is in order for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| to offer, one, offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| virtual instruction for students who would be isolated or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| quarantined. We don't have to. We've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| passed this. They're just gone for ten days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| come back, but to Mr. Thomas' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| when they return, you know, we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| try to do make-up work to get kids back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| We don't hold that punitive for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| And the other part of that is we could not count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| them present. They would be absent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| for the ten days they're quarantined or isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| and that would go against the school for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13465)|
| 3:44:27| chronic absenteeism, but also go against that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| you know, ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| So, like, yeah, we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| nothing, but that takes out those two options because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| those are required by the State Board to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| Okay. All right. Can we go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| Mr. McMillan? He hasn't asked any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| Yeah. John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| this really wasn't what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| going to ask, but I'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| What,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| you said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13491)|
| 3:44:53| the parent picking it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| if they didn't sign for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13495)|
| 3:44:59| Do you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| give them the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| and the computer and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| even if they refuse to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| be responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| Good question, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| We would not assign the computer at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| because there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| obviously it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13515)|
| 3:45:17| a school property and there are certain requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| of things that have to be done for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| What I would imagine we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| again is just work with the principal and the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| and probably move back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| maybe there's a paper packet or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| there's some kind of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| But the kid would not, until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| a parent agrees to be responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13535)|
| 3:45:37| the kid would not be able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| the computer home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| And I would say again, Mr. Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| knows how many people we have that are out there doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| It's probably a very small number that aren't willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| sign that and they may have good reasons not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| He can probably give you an idea of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| Did we have quite a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| damage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| those last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| or computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| So, we've currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| got about 55,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| families that have signed the device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| agreement, so we're down to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| 4,100 kids as of last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| I pulled the report that haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| completed that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| And regarding damage, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| we saw damage last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| ranging all the way from very minor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| bumps and bruises to the Chromebook all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| total loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| That was to be expected, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| did we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13585)|
| 3:46:29| do y'all have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| I'm not talking about you personally, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| did we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| than what we had anticipated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| I think it was well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| within, since we've already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| around eight years worth of one-to-one experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| in the district, it was pretty well within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| the range that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| kind of expected. We didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| any big surprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13611)|
| 3:46:53| to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| I don't know who was next. I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| Let's go to Mr. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| I mean, Ms. Henderson, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13623)|
| 3:47:05| I have a quick question about coding, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13625)|
| 3:47:07| maybe Freddy, sorry, you just sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| Is there a code for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| COVID absences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| so that way they're tracked more accurately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13633)|
| 3:47:17| Not currently, so that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| our absentee rate looks so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| and with this policy, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| allow us to add that virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| learning code, so we don't have a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| code at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| We can add a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| fidelity, so if we needed to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| virtual learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| with some additional steps, we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| that, but right now it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| So let's say my daughter's out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| I don't know, strep throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| She would be a virtual learner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| but a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| COVID, if she had COVID, she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| also be out as a virtual learner, so there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13669)|
| 3:47:51| way to distinguish if she had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13671)|
| 3:47:53| flu or strep or a broken leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| The policy as it stands is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| for COVID, so if your daughter was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13679)|
| 3:48:01| out for strep. Oh, gotcha. Okay, so that would just be a normal absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| Correct. Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| Thanks. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13685)|
| 3:48:07| Ms. Henderson. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| Ms. Stoen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| I think I just want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| I don't think anybody here is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| not approving the policy. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| that's where we're going. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| we're just trying to be sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| that this isn't what our teachers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| expecting and try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| what we're going to do to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| sure that they can be ready to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13717)|
| 3:48:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13719)|
| 3:48:41| Just a question about timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| It's not in here, but I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| Is the intent for this to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| retroactive to the beginning of the school year if it gets passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13727)|
| 3:48:53| Did you say retroactive to the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| of the school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13735)|
| 3:49:01| I would assume not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| I just want to make sure. I don't think it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| be because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| that data is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| sort of what it is. I don't think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| go back and recreate it. I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| I saw a similar policy in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| school district that made it retroactive and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| just want to make sure that we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| And then the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| to Ms. Owens' point and a lot of the concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| we brought up, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| would need to be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| according to current policy. It would need to be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| on two readings unless we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| forego that tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| opt out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| Mr. Dupler, can we pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| tonight, forego the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| second reading, but set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13781)|
| 3:49:43| an activation date in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| future? Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| We give a two-week window for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| teachers to kind of get their stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| more together in Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13791)|
| 3:49:55| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| According to B200 policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| the policies must be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| through two readings at separate board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| That's the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| So it just has to be separate board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| No, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| Mr. Dupler, I think it's a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| slightly different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| If we pass it tonight and forego the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| second reading, if we approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| could we also at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| set an activation date in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| Where we're approving it tonight, but we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13829)|
| 3:50:31| this does not become active until two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| from now or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| Right, prior to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| meeting that we have, which would be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13837)|
| 3:50:41| or I guess the other question is, could the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| second reading be at our meeting next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| or Wednesday? Does it have to be a regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| I like the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| You didn't like my first question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| No, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| Because that kind of gets into retroactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13857)|
| 3:51:01| I think in the past, all the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| policies have become effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| either at the time of passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| or some date in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| So we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| do first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| tonight and then we could formally pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| next week and give teachers at least a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| Mr. Watson, I'm thinking if you put it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| motion, what the effective date is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| then everybody would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13883)|
| 3:51:25| on the same page and I think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| be how to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13887)|
| 3:51:29| It would be if it's in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| when the policy would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| But I think Mr. Dupler's saying that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| necessarily the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13897)|
| 3:51:39| you said you didn't like my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| I don't think you like the possible answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13901)|
| 3:51:43| I'm just offering another way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| You could try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13905)|
| 3:51:47| I'm just, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| hadn't seen that done previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| but I'm not saying it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| I'm not saying I like it either. I'm just trying to figure out what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| The other thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13915)|
| 3:51:57| this policy needs to be specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| to the 21-22 school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| which is what's in the State Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| rule as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| Couldn't you do it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| effective September 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| or somewhere in the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| That would give several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| days for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| Sure, conceivably if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| pass this tonight and then pass it next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| you could then set a date in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| Yeah, 15th or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| Alright, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| Yes, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| Just one thing while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| talking about setting an effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| date in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| Just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| caveat that however far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| we set it out, we lose any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| data we would have collected between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13963)|
| 3:52:45| and then. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13965)|
| 3:52:47| you asked me a minute ago, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13967)|
| 3:52:49| we go back to the beginning of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13969)|
| 3:52:51| and create that? We can't, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| we'll sort of be in the same position for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| dead spot window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13975)|
| 3:52:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| Sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| I don't think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13983)|
| 3:53:05| to say a lot about it, but there is a whole section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| of this that's being possibly changed due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| truancy. Can we have somebody say a word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| to that section about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| why those changes are being recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13993)|
| 3:53:19| Hi, I'm Heather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| Wellness. I'm a supervisor of school culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| and basically we're making the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| to the truancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| progressive intervention truancy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| because it's a new law. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| effective July 1st, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| a new law. So is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| language that's in here basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| verbatim from the new law? It's copied and pasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| from the new law. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| Thank you. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| asking that question. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14029)|
| 3:53:53| Yes, there's a motion on the floor made by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| Christy and seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14039)|
| 3:54:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| I kind of stepped out for a moment, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| I got a little lost, but it almost seemed like some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| maybe wanted to amend the motion. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| or do we want to just leave it the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| it is? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| we would either need to, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| one question would be if we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| waive first reading would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| be one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| so that it goes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| you know, rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| having a second reading, so that's one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| and then that would be the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| question would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14075)|
| 3:54:37| effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14077)|
| 3:54:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14079)|
| 3:54:41| Yes, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14081)|
| 3:54:43| to accomplish what I'm trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| and I think what I've heard some other folks talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14085)|
| 3:54:47| I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| vote on it for first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14091)|
| 3:54:53| tonight, but then we ensure that it's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14093)|
| 3:54:55| for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14095)|
| 3:54:57| And I don't know if that needs to be a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14097)|
| 3:54:59| motion to make at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14099)|
| 3:55:01| to make sure it's on the agenda or at next week's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| meeting we add it back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14103)|
| 3:55:05| We would just add it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14107)|
| 3:55:09| I think that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| Alright, so are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| Everybody good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14113)|
| 3:55:15| Alright, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14117)|
| 3:55:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| Motion carries and so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| have a motion next week to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14123)|
| 3:55:25| to the agenda. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| Item 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| approve COVID-19 isolation leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| for employees of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14131)|
| 3:55:33| for June 30, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14133)|
| 3:55:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14137)|
| 3:55:39| We have a motion by Ms. Christy, a second by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| Satterfield. Do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| would someone from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| like to speak to this? Mr. Bolton, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14145)|
| 3:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14153)|
| 3:55:57| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| This gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| an opportunity to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| back and provide a little support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14163)|
| 3:56:05| employees that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| be under an isolation order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14167)|
| 3:56:09| as a result of being positive for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| COVID. We know that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| are breakthrough cases that do occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| and this would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| give those folks an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| recover any days that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| have used for COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| for being positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| So we're proposing that this would retro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| back to the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| Okay. Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14189)|
| 3:56:33| I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| it does because it says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| have shown proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| of the fact that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| you know from medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| I just thought we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| throw that in and make sure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| general public knew about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| it, you know, that it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| just like here's 10 free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| days. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14219)|
| 3:57:01| Thank you, Mr. Bolton. Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14223)|
| 3:57:05| Mr. Bolton, is there a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| our bus contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14227)|
| 3:57:09| can have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| kind of relief when our drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| are isolated? Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| something we could consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| I think because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| contracted employees, I don't think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| that our policies would extend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| and I may have to defer to Russ about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14243)|
| 3:57:37| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| answer is yes. We did some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| last year. We've not looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14261)|
| 3:57:43| closely this year but let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14263)|
| 3:57:45| let Ryan talk to the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14265)|
| 3:57:47| about how we did it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14267)|
| 3:57:49| what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| I think my question is really can we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14273)|
| 3:57:57| I think we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| that. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| we want to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| it carefully because there are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| incentives that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14285)|
| 3:58:07| we offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| vaccination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14289)|
| 3:58:11| to all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| contractors and all of our drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14293)|
| 3:58:15| and we didn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| broad acceptance of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| and so we've offered something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| to help mitigate the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| and now we want to turn around and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14303)|
| 3:58:25| potentially address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14305)|
| 3:58:27| compensating you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| not mitigating the risk that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14309)|
| 3:58:31| offered you. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| have to be very intentional about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14313)|
| 3:58:35| we do and how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| That's something that we have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| a little bit. We can discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| some more but you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14321)|
| 3:58:43| my concern going down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| I do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| Thank you. Ms. Hatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| Thank you, Madam Chair. I might be the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| with this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14333)|
| 3:58:55| medical physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| a note from a medical physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14339)|
| 3:59:01| mandatory from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| I'm trying to not just be angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14345)|
| 3:59:07| But I just feel like that's another barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14347)|
| 3:59:09| for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| They might not go to the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14351)|
| 3:59:13| to get that medical note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14355)|
| 3:59:17| I don't know if that's a mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14357)|
| 3:59:19| part from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14359)|
| 3:59:21| or is it from the state or what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14361)|
| 3:59:23| if we don't have to have that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14363)|
| 3:59:25| Is it mandatory? Is it required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14365)|
| 3:59:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14367)|
| 3:59:29| Thank you, Ms. Hatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14369)|
| 3:59:31| I don't think it is required locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| It's not required from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14373)|
| 3:59:35| I would probably say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14375)|
| 3:59:37| it is something we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| would want to consider just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14379)|
| 3:59:41| when we're looking at extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14381)|
| 3:59:43| this benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14383)|
| 3:59:45| a person would likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14385)|
| 3:59:47| need to have had a positive test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14387)|
| 3:59:49| to actually recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| those particular days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| and so some kind of medical certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14393)|
| 3:59:57| proving or providing some evidence of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| would satisfy that requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| whether that would be a positive test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| So just a positive test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14403)|
| 4:00:05| not a note from the actual medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| so just a positive test itself can verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| can work for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| I would think that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| as long as it's attached to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| I think that is when we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| That's certainly something that we can evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| I know there's a lot of different kinds of tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| so that's something that we'll take under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14425)|
| 4:00:27| Okay. I just don't want a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14427)|
| 4:00:29| for a teacher that tested positive for COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| having to go to the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| to get a note to get their days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| That's another step and another barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| I think it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14439)|
| 4:00:41| So if we can just have a verified positive test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14441)|
| 4:00:43| I think from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| that is something that I would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| Mr. Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| so the thing we just looked at was done in policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| I know we had policy G590| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| leave of absences for classified personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| and I'm sure there's probably some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| policies. Is this something that needs to be done in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| form of policy or is this memo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| type and I don't know Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| if that's the appropriate question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| I'll defer to Gary. We actually talked about a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14473)|
| 4:01:15| and because of its nature of a sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| we kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| I'll let Gary talk about that. Sorry, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| Yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14483)|
| 4:01:25| This can be done either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| This is an effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14487)|
| 4:01:31| substance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| provided it passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| the board's policy in a general sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| If the board wants this in a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| it would have to appear in more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| You mentioned G590. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| there's G491 and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14503)|
| 4:01:47| It can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| Just as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| the sun sets in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| that sort of like the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| one that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| just reviewed. However, the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| here is that this is optional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| and the one that the board just reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| required by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| Thank you. I don't really have a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| Just because we saw the other one in the form of policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| And then Mr. Oaks just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14535)|
| 4:02:17| pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| some of the potential problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| providing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| to bus drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14543)|
| 4:02:25| given that we didn't have a high vaccination rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14545)|
| 4:02:27| We're kind of providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| an opportunity for vaccination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| but then we're also potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| providing this benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| Is that something that was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14557)|
| 4:02:39| potential for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| particular policy? I know there's other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| in the state that have done similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| things that are giving additional leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| but only if you've been vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14567)|
| 4:02:49| or actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| only if you've been vaccinated or you submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| to regular testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| To me it's the same point that Mr. Oaks was just making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| about bus drivers. So I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14577)|
| 4:02:59| what the discussion was. So I'm going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14579)|
| 4:03:01| handle this carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| I think we've got to walk a tight line because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| we do have a state policy that prohibits us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| from soliciting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| about a person's vaccination status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| So I think what this does do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| this does protect those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| that have been vaccinated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| happen to have a breakthrough case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14601)|
| 4:03:23| to that point would be the absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| of what is not in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14605)|
| 4:03:27| This policy does not extend to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14607)|
| 4:03:29| that are under a quarantine order because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14609)|
| 4:03:31| we know in the CDC guidelines anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| that is vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| does not require anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| that is vaccinated and is a close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| contact is not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| to quarantine. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| required to or they're recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14623)|
| 4:03:45| to wear a mask for a 14 day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| and test after a certain day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| So embedded in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| that would be that incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| You know, if you are vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| there is no, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| a contact you're not going to have to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| So it does have that embedded into it for our purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| Thank you, Mr. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14645)|
| 4:04:07| Well, this was in reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14647)|
| 4:04:09| to what you were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| about. I don't want to put any burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| on anybody either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14653)|
| 4:04:15| as you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| but if we're going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| them the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14659)|
| 4:04:23| I think they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14663)|
| 4:04:25| be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| provide us with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14667)|
| 4:04:29| You know, especially if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14673)|
| 4:04:35| higher number like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| 7 or 8 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| 10 days. Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14679)|
| 4:04:41| from a standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| balances out because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14693)|
| 4:04:55| depending on your employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| if you work somewhere, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| might pay you for the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| that you're sick. You might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| get paid. It just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| shows good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14711)|
| 4:05:13| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| Can we go to Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14715)|
| 4:05:17| Well, just to speak to that and I think maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| Scott or Jason could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| verify but I think you can get a note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| from the health department if you've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| a positive COVID case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| to return to work. So I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| they would have to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| a physician to get that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| Yeah, I think that's just the clarity that I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| and I think that's the understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| we need to know, that the responsibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| going to the doctor, so if a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| test is enough proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| then that's what we should run with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14745)|
| 4:05:47| and that's the standard that we should make. And I also just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| say my frustration isn't with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14749)|
| 4:05:51| you all, it's the fact that we're even here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14751)|
| 4:05:53| at this moment of having to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| something out when it ran really smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| last year because of other barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14757)|
| 4:05:59| that have been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| So I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| I feel very frustrated and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| a lot of people in the district feel very frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| for things that are really out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14767)|
| 4:06:09| But I also want to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14769)|
| 4:06:11| will they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14771)|
| 4:06:13| need to, so say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14773)|
| 4:06:15| they did the test positive and quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14775)|
| 4:06:17| for 10 days, will they have to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| a negative test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14779)|
| 4:06:21| to come back to work? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| is there conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14783)|
| 4:06:25| around providing rapid tests for schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| I want to answer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| former first. The CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| does not require a negative test to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| to work. Once a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| tests positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| the 10 day isolation period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14799)|
| 4:06:41| would begin from symptom onset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| So it wouldn't even date back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14803)|
| 4:06:45| to the date of test. If a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| had symptoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| 48 hours prior to a test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| 10 day period would begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| 48 hours prior to the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| It would be at symptom onset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| So that would not require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| a test to return back to service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| And I may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14823)|
| 4:07:05| defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| Jason because he's had some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| but I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| to the extent of those conversations with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14835)|
| 4:07:17| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14837)|
| 4:07:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| board. Yeah, so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| had some preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14843)|
| 4:07:25| discussions with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| about the possibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| getting access to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| some of the tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14851)|
| 4:07:33| I won't call it a rapid test because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| a specific name to it. To be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14855)|
| 4:07:37| I don't remember that name at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| But there is some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| there about trying to provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| faster access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| to the test, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| if we are able to really move that forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| I would like to see our schools be able to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| rapid test. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14875)|
| 4:07:57| Ms. Satterfield. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| any other questions? Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| Thank you. I just want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| what Ms. Satterfield said. I was speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| to Jason earlier today about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14887)|
| 4:08:09| this for sure, but I've heard that there's potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14889)|
| 4:08:11| different pools of money from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| potentially the state money, state government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| and others for us to, schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| and specifically, to be able to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| those. So I'd like to see us do anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14899)|
| 4:08:21| we can with the health department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| any funders to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14903)|
| 4:08:25| provide that access. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14905)|
| 4:08:27| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14907)|
| 4:08:29| Okay. All right. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| all in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14915)|
| 4:08:37| All right. Can we take a 10-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14917)|
| 4:08:39| recess before we come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14919)|
| 4:08:41| the next three items, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14921)|
| 4:08:43| So we'll meet back here at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14923)|
| 4:08:45| 9.35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14925)|
| 4:08:51| Item 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| consideration of a school-based COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| dashboard for the 2021-2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14937)|
| 4:09:03| Okay. We have a motion by Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14943)|
| 4:09:05| a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14945)|
| 4:09:07| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14947)|
| 4:09:11| Ms. Henderson. Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| Since I brought this up, I just wanted to speak on it for just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14953)|
| 4:09:15| a minute. You know, the one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| we've heard from both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| on this issue is that every parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| wants more information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14961)|
| 4:09:23| their schools and their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| I personally believe we should have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14965)|
| 4:09:27| this from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| And since we haven't, I believe that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14969)|
| 4:09:31| has a responsibility to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14971)|
| 4:09:33| and require some of these measures now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| Thank you, Ms. Henderson. And I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| when we came back, if we could try to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| our comments short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14981)|
| 4:09:43| So that was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14983)|

| 4:09:47| Mr. Dupler, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14987)|
| 4:09:49| like to weigh in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| this issue from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14991)|
| 4:09:53| the law department's perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14993)|
| 4:09:55| I can. And thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| you, Madam Chair. And Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14997)|
| 4:09:59| and, you know, Ms. Henderson and I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| this before she brought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| motion and, you know, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| our office has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| pretty clear about where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| that because of FERPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| and corresponding state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15011)|
| 4:10:13| we've always recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| to the district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15015)|
| 4:10:17| administration that numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15017)|
| 4:10:19| be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| district-wide because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| is a best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15023)|
| 4:10:25| and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| is some divide among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| school board council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15029)|
| 4:10:31| across the state, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| there's also a significant number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| that agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15035)|
| 4:10:37| us that that's the best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15037)|
| 4:10:39| Now, with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| there was, and Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15041)|
| 4:10:43| and I were just talking about, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15043)|
| 4:10:45| statement issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15045)|
| 4:10:47| back in March of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| 2020 from the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15049)|
| 4:10:51| Department of Ed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15051)|
| 4:10:53| talks about, you know, COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15053)|
| 4:10:55| and FERPA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15055)|
| 4:10:57| what it talks about is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15057)|
| 4:10:59| it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15059)|
| 4:11:01| open the door to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15061)|
| 4:11:03| allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15063)|
| 4:11:05| data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15067)|
| 4:11:09| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15069)|
| 4:11:11| it says, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15071)|
| 4:11:13| just read it, the following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15073)|
| 4:11:15| and this also, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| comes from Knox County Risk Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15077)|
| 4:11:19| which also agrees with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15079)|
| 4:11:21| office, the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| that alone or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15087)|
| 4:11:29| in combination is linked or linkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15089)|
| 4:11:31| to a specific student that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| allow a reasonable person in the school community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| who does not have personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| knowledge of the relevant circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| to identify the student with reasonable certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| So what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| in our judgment, what that means is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15105)|
| 4:11:47| that if you start releasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| and frankly, it doesn't matter how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| small or large that school is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| if you release a low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| number, let's say it's one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| students that have COVID at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| school, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| the test is, can someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| from that community, not another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| but that community, then figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| out who that student is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| Well, the answer is it's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| happening on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15135)|
| 4:12:17| a FERPA violation at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| even though you haven't named that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15139)|
| 4:12:21| specifically. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| that's where we are. If this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| board does adopt a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| well, again, it's still district-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| but if the board does want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| this, which the board can do with a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| our recommendation would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| then be make this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| anonymous as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| How would you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| By ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| instead of specific students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| or specific numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| you could also look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15173)|
| 4:12:55| a threshold as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15175)|
| 4:12:57| Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| Dupleur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| I just wanted to just respond to Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| and Gary and I have been in conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| about this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15187)|
| 4:13:09| you know, I came up with this idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| well, I thought about it last year, but, you know, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| different districts that are doing it, large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| districts, smaller districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| Oak Ridge, Maryville, Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| are a couple that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| And we did talk about maybe putting a privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| statement, perhaps, at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| I did bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15205)|
| 4:13:29| document that you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| from the Department of Education at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| But my other thought is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| you know, this is happening on Facebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| and that information is getting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| but not from us. And this is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| for us to show transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| and for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15227)|
| 4:13:49| information to give to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| And that way it's coming from a reputable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15231)|
| 4:13:53| source, not on these Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| groups that are all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15235)|
| 4:13:59| Okay. Ms. Bowen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| Mr. Dupler, could it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| more anonymous if it were done as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| percentage rather than as a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15249)|
| 4:14:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| Okay. Mr. Watkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| Mr. Dupler, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| was reflecting back last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| I got a lot of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| from principals, and I know they're starting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| send them out again this year, saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15267)|
| 4:14:29| today we have a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| positive case in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15271)|
| 4:14:35| How is that different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| than the dashboard, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| sense of we're notifying that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| every day, potentially, if there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| active case. The dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| would retain that information, and it would grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15285)|
| 4:14:47| but how is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| that different? I just want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| are we crossing a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15291)|
| 4:14:53| too with that, with that notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15293)|
| 4:14:55| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15297)|
| 4:14:59| what FERPA provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| is that each bit of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15303)|
| 4:15:05| send out in the aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| is a step closer to identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| And I would also say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| as far as transparency goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| transparency in government is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| releasing students' private data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| you know, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| what you're saying, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| it's my understanding that what the district did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| last year, and is apparently continuing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15329)|
| 4:15:31| this year, is sending out a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15331)|
| 4:15:33| to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| when there's been some type of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15335)|
| 4:15:37| case at the school. Yeah, an email, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| But that's all it says. Right. It's just, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15339)|
| 4:15:41| there's been some COVID case. It doesn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15341)|
| 4:15:43| how many or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15343)|
| 4:15:45| whatnot. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| again, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| our concern, our law department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| concern is, so then, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| you're doing right now is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| you're saying, district data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15357)|
| 4:15:59| and then letters to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| So now what you're going to do is you're going to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| step forward, or further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| toward risking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15365)|
| 4:16:07| you know, a violation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15367)|
| 4:16:09| apparently still doing the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| but now giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| school-based data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| instead of just district-wide. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15375)|
| 4:16:17| on page four of that documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| the last paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| starting with, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15381)|
| 4:16:23| I know not everybody's looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| at this, but... I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| You have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| It says, are you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15389)|
| 4:16:31| Mr. Duplin? I got it. So, it says, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15391)|
| 4:16:33| if an educational agency or institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| releases the fact that individuals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| absent due to COVID-19 but does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15397)|
| 4:16:39| disclose their identities, this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| generally not be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| personal identifiable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15403)|
| 4:16:45| the absent students under FERPA, as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15405)|
| 4:16:47| as there's other individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15407)|
| 4:16:49| at the educational agency or institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| who are also absent for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| So, are you saying that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15413)|
| 4:16:55| letters that we're sending out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| would fall under that, that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| notifying that there's individuals being sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15419)|
| 4:17:01| but because it's not aggregated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| that's when it becomes the challenge? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15423)|
| 4:17:05| And then, if you go on to the next sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| you know... Which is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| you read. Exactly. Yeah. Right. Cautioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15429)|
| 4:17:11| to do so in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| that does not disclose other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| alone or in combinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| that's what we're talking about, you know, with the letters and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| dashboard, that's a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15439)|
| 4:17:21| that would allow a reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15441)|
| 4:17:23| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15443)|
| 4:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15445)|
| 4:17:27| Ms. Henderson? Yes. Can I also, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| Diebler, ask your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15449)|
| 4:17:31| on one thing that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15451)|
| 4:17:33| from several principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| is the fact that they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| you know, they see a class and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| they know someone is positive in that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| and they cannot notify anyone else in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| class. Can they send a more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15463)|
| 4:17:45| email to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| you know, we've had COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| cases in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| in fourth grade. Can they do it by grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| Can they disclose a class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| where that is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| so that parents are aware and can make informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| decisions for their own children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15479)|
| 4:18:03| Mr. Diebler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15483)|
| 4:18:07| It's also addressed on page six of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| Ms. Henderson, are you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| a specific class or are you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| a grade band? Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| I'm just trying to get more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| information for parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| in our office's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| disclosing to other parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| a student in a class would be a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| violation of FERPA. Okay. Do you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| send letters for lice? Is that still a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| in a classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| No, we don't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| Okay. Because you're not disclosing the child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| just, hey, in fourth grade we've got some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| just so parents know what to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| Like if I have a fourth grader, it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| okay, well, I know it's bad in my child's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| grade, but if it's bad in kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| maybe I'm not as concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15527)|
| 4:18:53| Okay. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15533)|
| 4:18:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15537)|
| 4:18:59| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| I mean, I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15543)|
| 4:19:05| you bring up is a good question because basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| let's say we have a dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| by school. The next question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| is going to be, well, which grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| Which class? I mean, so I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15553)|
| 4:19:15| going to be a natural question. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| Yes. This question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| is actually, thank you, Madam Chair. This is directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15559)|
| 4:19:21| to Ms. Henderson. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15561)|
| 4:19:23| Ms. Henderson, you said in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| bullet point three of your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| school administrators will notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| parents of a possible exposure in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15569)|
| 4:19:31| student's grade and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| provide them with recommended actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15573)|
| 4:19:35| they can take, a link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| to the school-based dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15579)|
| 4:19:41| what I'm trying to figure out, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| even as a parent with kids in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15583)|
| 4:19:45| if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15585)|
| 4:19:47| see this dashboard for the school that my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15587)|
| 4:19:49| in, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15589)|
| 4:19:51| see that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| there's 15 cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15593)|
| 4:19:55| in that school, I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| to think practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15597)|
| 4:19:59| what I would do with that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15599)|
| 4:20:01| information because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| that information is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| necessarily help me contact trace them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| myself. I mean, I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| know any more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15609)|
| 4:20:11| I do think, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15611)|
| 4:20:13| I'm all for transparency. I'm like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| let's get as much as we can out there. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| just trying to figure out what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| what a person would practically do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| with the information. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| think it could cause potentially more anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| because people don't have enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15625)|
| 4:20:27| to actually pinpoint what the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15627)|
| 4:20:29| may be. And so they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15629)|
| 4:20:31| almost to the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15631)|
| 4:20:33| And they're like, oh, but I really don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15633)|
| 4:20:35| know what I can do or not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15635)|
| 4:20:37| And I will tell you, I came into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15637)|
| 4:20:39| and I think I even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15639)|
| 4:20:41| mentioned this to others that, like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| I'd like to see it by school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| but as I've thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15645)|
| 4:20:47| the practicalities of it and what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| do as a parent with that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15649)|
| 4:20:51| so help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| what I might do with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15653)|
| 4:20:55| When I see the dashboard now, as a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| I'm talking from a mom's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15657)|
| 4:20:59| when I see the current dashboard and I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15659)|
| 4:21:01| 900 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15661)|
| 4:21:03| are sick, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| really know what that means to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| Is it 700 kids at Gibbs Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| Is it 200 kids at Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15669)|
| 4:21:11| Intermediate? I don't know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15671)|
| 4:21:13| means to me as a parent. The more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15673)|
| 4:21:15| information I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15675)|
| 4:21:17| that is affecting my particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15677)|
| 4:21:19| school, I can then make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15679)|
| 4:21:21| informed decisions. Okay, well, you know, Molly's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15681)|
| 4:21:23| grade, my daughter's grade is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15683)|
| 4:21:25| or her school has more cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15685)|
| 4:21:27| I can either choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| to, should she wear a mask for a couple days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15689)|
| 4:21:31| Should I be looking a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15691)|
| 4:21:33| bit more proactively for symptoms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15693)|
| 4:21:35| Maybe I keep her out for a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15695)|
| 4:21:37| So I just think that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| parent, me having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15699)|
| 4:21:41| information, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15701)|
| 4:21:43| use to make a good decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15703)|
| 4:21:45| for my family. And I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15705)|
| 4:21:47| a couple of the other school districts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15707)|
| 4:21:49| are doing the school by school dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15709)|
| 4:21:51| and their parents are really pleased with the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15713)|
| 4:21:55| that's affecting their particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15715)|
| 4:21:57| I did as well. I talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15717)|
| 4:21:59| I think it was Williamson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15719)|
| 4:22:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15725)|
| 4:22:07| Chair. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15727)|
| 4:22:09| to Ms. Henderson's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15729)|
| 4:22:11| when we were first looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15731)|
| 4:22:13| at COVID last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15733)|
| 4:22:15| one of the things the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| talked about was looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15737)|
| 4:22:19| by community instead of as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15739)|
| 4:22:21| all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| and looking at, you know, being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| extra cautious if it was spreading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15745)|
| 4:22:27| in a certain area. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15747)|
| 4:22:29| that would give that information whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15749)|
| 4:22:31| something is happening in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| of the county or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15753)|
| 4:22:35| if it's more broad than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15757)|
| 4:22:39| think it feels a little different when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15759)|
| 4:22:41| seems like something's spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15761)|
| 4:22:43| countywide and then if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| you knew that 600 of those 900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| cases were in your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| I think that's quite different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15769)|
| 4:22:51| However, what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| really rather see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| us doing contact tracing so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15775)|
| 4:22:57| could call that parent and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15777)|
| 4:22:59| your child's been exposed. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15779)|
| 4:23:01| that would be the most useful thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15781)|
| 4:23:03| that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15783)|
| 4:23:05| Thank you. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| Ms. Henderson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| And I just want to say, you know, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15789)|
| 4:23:11| think for any of this there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| a perfect plan. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15793)|
| 4:23:15| think that there is a plan that is 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15795)|
| 4:23:17| but I do think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15797)|
| 4:23:19| to do something. And so, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15799)|
| 4:23:21| have all the answers, but I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| here's a starting point on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15803)|
| 4:23:25| for parents. So that's kind of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| I'm coming from on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15807)|
| 4:23:29| policy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15809)|
| 4:23:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| Thank you. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15813)|
| 4:23:35| And this is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| suggestion hearing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| Mr. Watson and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15819)|
| 4:23:41| is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| it would be a little less specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| but I had a principal show me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15825)|
| 4:23:47| the report she got from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15827)|
| 4:23:49| basically showing every single school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15829)|
| 4:23:51| that needed to make the call out that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15831)|
| 4:23:53| And I was even wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| if it was just a, if, okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| if you're looking at our overall dashboard, you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| there's, you know, the cases have gone 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15839)|
| 4:24:01| We look and there's only five schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| that have had to make calls out that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| That would give people a sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| it's not countywide. Now what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| kind of getting a sense of, it's pretty countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| but I think maybe that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15851)|
| 4:24:13| sort of even help people. It wouldn't get as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| specific as into how many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15855)|
| 4:24:17| but you might see on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| day, 74 of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15859)|
| 4:24:21| had cases. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15861)|
| 4:24:23| had to make the calls out to it. Because right now, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15863)|
| 4:24:25| you're learning about is your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| but that might be a way where it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| quite so specific because you're not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15869)|
| 4:24:31| cases, but you're seeing how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15871)|
| 4:24:33| schools per day are actually having to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15873)|
| 4:24:35| calls about cases. That's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| one suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15877)|
| 4:24:39| So you would see all the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| that made the calls. So you would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| if the schools are around you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| You know what, I just am trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| work between more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| wanted and trying to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| the FERPA that it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| we're doing, too. I mean, what the reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15893)|
| 4:24:55| and what we all know that's going on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15895)|
| 4:24:57| we all know the parents are going about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15897)|
| 4:24:59| sharing everybody's business all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15899)|
| 4:25:01| Facebook. But I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15901)|
| 4:25:03| that's not our job to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15903)|
| 4:25:05| And it's alarming sometimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| maybe some parents are oversharing, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15907)|
| 4:25:09| it's about their own child or other children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| Parents aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| under FERPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15913)|
| 4:25:15| Right, right. And that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15915)|
| 4:25:17| I know that they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| And that's where I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| think of a way that's sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| getting more information out that's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15923)|
| 4:25:25| at a granular level without getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| so specific. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15927)|
| 4:25:29| just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15929)|
| 4:25:31| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| I'm very torn on this because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| want parents to have the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15935)|
| 4:25:37| they need, but to Mr. Watson's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15937)|
| 4:25:39| I'm concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| they're going to want more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15941)|
| 4:25:43| and what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15943)|
| 4:25:45| you do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15945)|
| 4:25:47| It would be difficult as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| a parent. I'm not sure if it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| I don't know. And then if risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| management and the law department are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15953)|
| 4:25:55| completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15955)|
| 4:25:57| comfortable with it, then it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15957)|
| 4:25:59| of a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| I do have one more question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15961)|
| 4:26:03| Diepler. Can you speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15963)|
| 4:26:05| to the schools that are doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15965)|
| 4:26:07| Like Maryville or Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15967)|
| 4:26:09| or some of the other schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15969)|
| 4:26:11| are doing this and how they are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15971)|
| 4:26:13| it legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15973)|
| 4:26:15| Yes, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15975)|
| 4:26:17| Madam Chair, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| Again, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| school board attorneys do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15981)|
| 4:26:23| talk on occasion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15983)|
| 4:26:25| we've communicated on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15985)|
| 4:26:27| point and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15987)|
| 4:26:29| what I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15989)|
| 4:26:31| by the attorneys that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15991)|
| 4:26:33| districts that are doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15993)|
| 4:26:35| is that they are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15995)|
| 4:26:37| either thresholds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15997)|
| 4:26:39| and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| ranges for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16001)|
| 4:26:43| reporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| I was a little concerned when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16005)|
| 4:26:47| looked at some of these dashboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16007)|
| 4:26:49| I couldn't readily see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16009)|
| 4:26:51| Maybe that's going on in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16011)|
| 4:26:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16013)|
| 4:26:55| But that was the discussion we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| from the ones that are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16017)|
| 4:26:59| What does threshold mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16019)|
| 4:27:01| Threshold, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16021)|
| 4:27:03| if you've got a small school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| set your threshold maybe a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| lower than you would a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16029)|
| 4:27:11| school. A percentage would be a good way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16031)|
| 4:27:13| look at it. Maybe 5% or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16033)|
| 4:27:15| 10% or something like that. That would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| your threshold. You wouldn't report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16039)|
| 4:27:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16041)|
| 4:27:23| Because we do have some very, very small schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16043)|
| 4:27:25| So if you reported a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| it could be easy to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16047)|
| 4:27:29| out which students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| Absolutely. Especially, again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16051)|
| 4:27:33| the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16053)|
| 4:27:35| FERPA works is that you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16055)|
| 4:27:37| the community, right? You're not looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| somebody clear across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16059)|
| 4:27:41| being able to figure it out. It's someone in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16061)|
| 4:27:43| Okay. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16063)|
| 4:27:45| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16065)|
| 4:27:47| interesting trying to tease this out in my own mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16067)|
| 4:27:49| But if you have a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16069)|
| 4:27:51| and if you're a parent and you know the school's enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| you can work backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| I mean you still get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| number, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16077)|
| 4:27:59| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16079)|
| 4:28:01| That assumes math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16083)|
| 4:28:07| I think to me the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16087)|
| 4:28:09| would feel the most comfortable with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16089)|
| 4:28:11| is the range solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16091)|
| 4:28:13| Percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| you can do the math, you can work backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| It becomes that. I'm not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16097)|
| 4:28:19| saying I love it. I just think that's probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16099)|
| 4:28:21| way I'm most comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| So then that would be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| for instance a range. If you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16105)|
| 4:28:27| let's say you had 10 cases in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| like would you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| are you saying a percentage range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16111)|
| 4:28:33| or like an actual number range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| I think, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16115)|
| 4:28:37| I don't think we have the time to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16117)|
| 4:28:39| out all those ranges right now. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16119)|
| 4:28:41| depending on the school. So maybe the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| range is 0 to 20 and then you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16123)|
| 4:28:45| 20 to 40 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16125)|
| 4:28:47| And then you just say what it is. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16127)|
| 4:28:49| I don't know that we can determine that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| And I know Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16131)|
| 4:28:53| provided an example of one. But I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16133)|
| 4:28:55| necessarily that you were asking us to lay it out exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16135)|
| 4:28:57| like that. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16137)|
| 4:28:59| I'm just using that as an example for anybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16139)|
| 4:29:01| hadn't seen a school by school dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16141)|
| 4:29:03| Right. Thank you. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| I mean Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16145)|
| 4:29:07| Yeah. I think we do need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16147)|
| 4:29:09| give parents more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16149)|
| 4:29:11| And you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16151)|
| 4:29:13| to speak to you know what are they going to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16153)|
| 4:29:15| Well, it's better than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| the information they're getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16157)|
| 4:29:19| You know because literally there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| much at all they can do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| in a district this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16163)|
| 4:29:25| And I do think you know when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| parents making choices for their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16167)|
| 4:29:29| we need to give them all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16169)|
| 4:29:31| we can to make those choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16171)|
| 4:29:33| Be it a range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| or the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16175)|
| 4:29:37| Thank you Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16177)|
| 4:29:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| I'd like to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16183)|
| 4:29:45| a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16185)|
| 4:29:47| if that's okay. Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16187)|
| 4:29:49| I'm going to offer a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16189)|
| 4:29:51| So with your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| based on our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16193)|
| 4:29:55| I would strike bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| point two because I think that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16197)|
| 4:29:59| addresses, tries to address some of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16199)|
| 4:30:01| And strike bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16201)|
| 4:30:03| point three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| But keep the rest of it the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16205)|
| 4:30:07| and then have the, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16207)|
| 4:30:09| passes, have the administration work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16209)|
| 4:30:11| the law department to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| out what's an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16213)|
| 4:30:15| what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16215)|
| 4:30:17| least likely way that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16217)|
| 4:30:19| infringe on FERPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16219)|
| 4:30:21| in terms of how we're reporting that at a school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16221)|
| 4:30:23| That we do report it at a school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16223)|
| 4:30:25| but we work with the law department to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16225)|
| 4:30:27| what's the best approach to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| Okay and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16229)|
| 4:30:31| the motion that we really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16231)|
| 4:30:33| on the floor is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16233)|
| 4:30:35| the agenda item is, is consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16235)|
| 4:30:37| of a school based COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16237)|
| 4:30:39| dashboard. So we probably really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| need an actual motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16243)|
| 4:30:45| the motion was attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16245)|
| 4:30:47| It's attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16247)|
| 4:30:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16249)|
| 4:30:51| It's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16251)|
| 4:30:53| She hasn't read it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| May want to actually make the motion and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16255)|
| 4:30:57| if she's agreeable to what you're saying she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16257)|
| 4:30:59| just incorporate that into the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16259)|
| 4:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16261)|
| 4:31:03| I make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16263)|
| 4:31:05| help me out here Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16265)|
| 4:31:07| I make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16267)|
| 4:31:11| You can use your verbiage that you have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16271)|
| 4:31:13| I make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16273)|
| 4:31:15| for the consideration of a school based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16275)|
| 4:31:17| COVID-19 dashboard for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16277)|
| 4:31:19| 2021-2022 school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| along with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| Watson's friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16283)|
| 4:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| So I'm making a motion to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16289)|
| 4:31:31| on it with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16291)|
| 4:31:33| Watson's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Since it's my friendly amendment can I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| the friendly amendment and see if you're agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16297)|
| 4:31:39| Yes. Okay. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| friendly amendment would be and I'm just going to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16301)|
| 4:31:43| it verbatim. During the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| 2021 school year, Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16305)|

| 4:31:57| decisions possible for their children and themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| The dashboard will sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| at the close of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16321)|
| 4:32:03| on May 26, 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16323)|
| 4:32:05| and I think that's probably where I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16325)|
| 4:32:07| stop. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16327)|
| 4:32:09| 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| I didn't read 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16331)|
| 4:32:13| It just didn't come to my lips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| I accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16335)|
| 4:32:17| his friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16337)|
| 4:32:19| Is that how I say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16339)|
| 4:32:27| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16347)|
| 4:32:29| what I understand is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| Ms. Henderson, Ms. Watson, you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| a motion of just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16355)|
| 4:32:37| first portion of what's written. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16357)|
| 4:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16361)|
| 4:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16363)|
| 4:32:45| Okay. So you may want to just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| that with the motion that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| asking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| school administration and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| to figure out the ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| or to calculate the ranges. So I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| read that in. So then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| in addition, the other part of that friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| amendment would be the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16381)|
| 4:33:03| is for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16383)|
| 4:33:05| Schools administration to work with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16385)|
| 4:33:07| to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| the appropriate way to represent the school based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16389)|

| 4:33:21| Okay. Fantastic. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| Ms. Owen? I would just note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16403)|
| 4:33:25| Washington County has one that uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16405)|

| 4:33:29| to look at. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16409)|
| 4:33:31| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16411)|
| 4:33:33| Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16413)|

| 4:34:19| is the motion to require universal masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16459)|

| 4:35:13| by the school principal due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16513)|
| 4:35:15| to a documented medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16515)|
| 4:35:17| condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16517)|
| 4:35:19| So I've just got a couple brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16519)|
| 4:35:21| So, you know, I'm absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16521)|
| 4:35:23| confident that none of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16523)|
| 4:35:25| on this board, when we ran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16525)|
| 4:35:27| to serve, ran so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16527)|
| 4:35:29| we could help mitigate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16529)|
| 4:35:31| COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16531)|
| 4:35:33| But we don't often get to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16533)|
| 4:35:37| what we get to lead through. You know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16537)|
| 4:35:39| is our season. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16539)|
| 4:35:41| in the last three weeks I personally received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16541)|
| 4:35:43| over 1,200 emails, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16543)|
| 4:35:45| by far the most I've ever received in that stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16545)|
| 4:35:47| regarding coded protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16547)|
| 4:35:49| I have not been able to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16549)|
| 4:35:51| all of them nor would I think anybody else on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16551)|
| 4:35:53| has been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16553)|
| 4:35:55| We've all been affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16555)|
| 4:35:57| this pandemic, some much more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16557)|
| 4:35:59| others. You know, I don't know what it feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16559)|
| 4:36:01| to lose a loved one due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16561)|

| 4:36:05| I don't know what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16565)|
| 4:36:07| to care for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16567)|
| 4:36:09| who is hospitalized due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16569)|

| 4:36:13| I, like many others, do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16573)|
| 4:36:15| what it feels like to experience grief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16575)|
| 4:36:17| through this time, frustration, distress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16577)|
| 4:36:19| and uncertainty in the midst of a constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| situation, changing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| And I think we can all agree that things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16583)|
| 4:36:25| are constantly changing. I mean, we just got more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16585)|
| 4:36:27| information from the state that impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16587)|
| 4:36:29| all the things that we did tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16589)|
| 4:36:31| which also we referenced when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16591)|
| 4:36:33| did them CDC guidance quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| too, as we did some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16595)|
| 4:36:37| So, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16597)|
| 4:36:39| 2021 school year, Superintendent Thomas'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16599)|
| 4:36:41| leadership and the board consistently followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16601)|
| 4:36:43| public health guidance. We made our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16603)|
| 4:36:45| own local decisions last year. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16605)|
| 4:36:47| followed the recommendations of public health leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16607)|
| 4:36:49| which was an appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16609)|
| 4:36:51| KCS was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16611)|
| 4:36:53| to accomplish something no other district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16613)|
| 4:36:55| that I know of in the state was able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16615)|
| 4:36:57| And everyone agrees that students should be in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16617)|
| 4:36:59| instruction as it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16619)|
| 4:37:01| a great opportunity for students to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16621)|
| 4:37:03| We also need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| remember that students do not live in bubbles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| A lot has changed in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16627)|
| 4:37:09| two weeks, and you all have heard the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16629)|
| 4:37:11| tonight. I'm not going to repeat the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16631)|
| 4:37:13| in terms of COVID in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16633)|
| 4:37:15| We also know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16635)|
| 4:37:17| that many people have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16637)|
| 4:37:19| people who have not previously spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16639)|
| 4:37:21| have spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16641)|
| 4:37:23| universal masking in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16643)|
| 4:37:25| Dr. Percy, just on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16645)|
| 4:37:27| 25th, said the best way to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16647)|
| 4:37:29| children is for schools and parents to mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16649)|
| 4:37:31| up their students. When more kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| are masked in classrooms, they're more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16653)|
| 4:37:35| to stay in school. She also referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16655)|
| 4:37:37| that, this is on the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| there's been 14,000 pediatric cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16659)|
| 4:37:41| in the last seven days alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16661)|
| 4:37:43| with 1,300 emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16663)|
| 4:37:45| visits, 36% of all cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16665)|
| 4:37:47| in the state are children, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16667)|
| 4:37:49| largest increase coming from children 5 to 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16669)|
| 4:37:51| So, the board chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16671)|
| 4:37:53| at our board meeting on 8-11 not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16673)|
| 4:37:55| to give the superintendent the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16675)|
| 4:37:57| to implement a layered COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16677)|
| 4:37:59| mitigation strategy that included masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16679)|
| 4:38:01| So, I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16681)|
| 4:38:03| for the board to consider doing that, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16683)|
| 4:38:05| we didn't give him the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16685)|
| 4:38:07| do it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16687)|
| 4:38:11| I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16691)|
| 4:38:13| really poignant, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16693)|
| 4:38:15| many times that people spoke tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16695)|
| 4:38:17| and emails, and conversations that I've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16697)|
| 4:38:19| that one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16699)|
| 4:38:21| teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| and administrators that I've talked to are absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16703)|
| 4:38:25| overwhelmed. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16705)|
| 4:38:27| right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16707)|
| 4:38:29| they're saying it's worse than last year, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16709)|
| 4:38:31| they're experiencing in their schools, in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16711)|
| 4:38:33| overload, and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16713)|
| 4:38:35| make up for people that are out, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16715)|
| 4:38:37| cover all the bases, and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16717)|
| 4:38:39| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16719)|
| 4:38:41| you know, I know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| all love our liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16723)|
| 4:38:45| and I love it just as much as anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16725)|
| 4:38:47| and if anybody came to my house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16727)|
| 4:38:49| tried to tell me I had to do X, Y, and Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16729)|
| 4:38:51| then I would probably be frustrated by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16731)|
| 4:38:53| But, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16733)|
| 4:38:55| here as stewards of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| and we have to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16737)|
| 4:38:59| set the tone for our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16739)|
| 4:39:01| and I would like the board's consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16741)|
| 4:39:03| and I think this is in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16743)|
| 4:39:05| with what the governor did in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16745)|
| 4:39:07| executive order. It provides an opt-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16747)|
| 4:39:09| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16749)|
| 4:39:11| anybody who requests it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16751)|
| 4:39:15| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| Yeah, just a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16759)|
| 4:39:21| You know, I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16761)|
| 4:39:23| hear a lot of people say how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| happy they were about last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16765)|
| 4:39:27| but I'm just going to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16767)|
| 4:39:29| you my emails last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16769)|
| 4:39:31| were not any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16771)|
| 4:39:33| than they were this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16773)|
| 4:39:35| No one was happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16775)|
| 4:39:37| when we started back last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16777)|
| 4:39:39| And, at that time, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16779)|
| 4:39:41| we can't even have face-to-face school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16781)|
| 4:39:43| until we go 14 days with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16783)|
| 4:39:45| new cases. And, if we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16785)|
| 4:39:47| stuck to that and voted for that, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16787)|
| 4:39:49| wouldn't be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16789)|
| 4:39:51| I mean, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16791)|
| 4:39:53| And, just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16793)|
| 4:39:55| of concerns. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16795)|
| 4:39:57| the Health Department has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16797)|
| 4:39:59| issued a mandate anywhere else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16799)|
| 4:40:01| You know, in Neyland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16801)|
| 4:40:03| Stadium, there's a football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16803)|
| 4:40:05| game. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16805)|
| 4:40:07| Patty's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16807)|
| 4:40:09| somewhat controversial, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16809)|
| 4:40:11| according to email, pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16811)|

| 4:40:17| They're everywhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16817)|
| 4:40:19| without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16819)|
| 4:40:21| a mask. And, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16821)|
| 4:40:23| you say listen to the public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16823)|
| 4:40:25| officials, well, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16825)|
| 4:40:27| our local public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16827)|
| 4:40:29| official made it pretty clear that she couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16829)|
| 4:40:31| mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16831)|
| 4:40:33| one in Knox County because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16833)|
| 4:40:35| she knew people wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16835)|
| 4:40:37| follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16837)|
| 4:40:39| You know, I did have a good conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16839)|
| 4:40:41| with Dr. Childs today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16841)|
| 4:40:43| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16843)|
| 4:40:45| the Children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16845)|
| 4:40:47| Hospital capacity is fine right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16847)|
| 4:40:49| now. You know, and he did say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16849)|
| 4:40:51| there might be a time, or if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16851)|
| 4:40:53| ever was a time where it wasn't, he would definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16853)|
| 4:40:55| let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16855)|
| 4:40:57| And, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16857)|
| 4:40:59| thing is, when we talk about the overwhelmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16859)|
| 4:41:01| teachers and administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16861)|
| 4:41:03| at the end of the day, this is still an optional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16863)|
| 4:41:05| mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16865)|
| 4:41:07| I mean, it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16867)|
| 4:41:09| a mask policy that people cannot doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16869)|
| 4:41:11| of. I mean, it's still optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16871)|
| 4:41:13| So, basically, you know, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16873)|
| 4:41:15| I've heard from a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16875)|
| 4:41:17| people in my district is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16877)|
| 4:41:19| that, basically, what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16879)|
| 4:41:21| is transferring that responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16881)|
| 4:41:23| to the schools. And, it's just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16883)|
| 4:41:25| to be, who's going to keep track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16885)|
| 4:41:27| You know, and it might not be such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16887)|
| 4:41:29| a problem in some schools because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16889)|
| 4:41:31| some schools will embrace it a lot more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16891)|
| 4:41:33| others. But, you know, if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16893)|
| 4:41:35| schools where half and half or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16895)|
| 4:41:37| 60-40, who's going to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16897)|
| 4:41:39| charge of keeping track of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16899)|
| 4:41:41| who has to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16901)|
| 4:41:43| mask on, who doesn't have to have a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16903)|
| 4:41:45| on, you know, and heaven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16905)|
| 4:41:47| help the subs if somebody takes off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| a mask that should have one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16909)|
| 4:41:51| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16911)|
| 4:41:53| you know, I just have heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16913)|
| 4:41:55| there might be issues there with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16915)|
| 4:41:57| Thank you, Ms. Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16917)|
| 4:41:59| Ms. Bounds. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16919)|
| 4:42:01| And, I haven't said a whole lot tonight, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16921)|
| 4:42:03| it may take a few minutes. But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16923)|
| 4:42:05| first, the question has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16925)|
| 4:42:07| I just want to go on record with this first statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16927)|
| 4:42:09| The question has been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16929)|
| 4:42:11| do I have children in Knox County School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16931)|
| 4:42:13| And, the answer is a resounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16933)|
| 4:42:15| yes. I have 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16935)|
| 4:42:17| grandchildren, 5 in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| Schools, 2 in Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| Schools, and 6 others in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| here in Knoxville. So, I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16943)|
| 4:42:25| well represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16945)|
| 4:42:27| I also want to go on record that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16947)|
| 4:42:29| never made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16949)|
| 4:42:31| based on politics in all my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16951)|
| 4:42:33| years on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16953)|
| 4:42:35| And then, directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16955)|
| 4:42:37| addressing the COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16957)|
| 4:42:39| I, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| I just don't understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| difference, kind of like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16963)|
| 4:42:45| Ms. Christie was pointing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16965)|
| 4:42:47| We are being asked to force people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16967)|
| 4:42:49| opt out when already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16969)|
| 4:42:51| people can opt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16971)|
| 4:42:53| And, we keep coming at this from every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16973)|
| 4:42:55| possible angle, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16975)|
| 4:42:57| to get a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| And, what I see it doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| is further dividing our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16981)|
| 4:43:03| and keeping parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| in a state of anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| Every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16987)|
| 4:43:09| we listen to how many emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16989)|
| 4:43:11| received, but number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16991)|
| 4:43:13| of emails alone does not equate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16993)|
| 4:43:15| to support for either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16995)|
| 4:43:17| As we listened to the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16997)|
| 4:43:19| tonight and tallied them, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=16999)|
| 4:43:21| about half and half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17001)|
| 4:43:23| My emails over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17003)|
| 4:43:25| until today were 9 to 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17005)|
| 4:43:27| against a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17007)|
| 4:43:29| And, what I liked the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17009)|
| 4:43:31| about those most recent emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17011)|
| 4:43:33| were they were from grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17013)|
| 4:43:35| asking us not to mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17015)|
| 4:43:37| masks for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17017)|
| 4:43:39| And, they were also from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17019)|
| 4:43:41| students of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17021)|

| 4:43:45| I live life, and the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| of Knox Countians are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17027)|
| 4:43:49| unmasked wherever I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17029)|
| 4:43:51| And, one of our Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17031)|
| 4:43:53| had 700 grandparents sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17033)|
| 4:43:55| for a grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17035)|
| 4:43:57| day in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| So, to me, that speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17039)|
| 4:44:01| volumes about my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17041)|
| 4:44:03| district, and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17043)|
| 4:44:05| end of the day, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17045)|
| 4:44:07| work for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17047)|
| 4:44:09| child in this district, but I also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17049)|
| 4:44:11| to listen to the people in District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17051)|
| 4:44:13| 7 and what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17053)|
| 4:44:15| And so, I will vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17055)|
| 4:44:17| accordingly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17057)|
| 4:44:19| Thank you, Ms. Pounds. Ms. Bowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17059)|
| 4:44:21| First, I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17061)|
| 4:44:23| Mr. Watson, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17063)|
| 4:44:25| yellow moderate transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17065)|
| 4:44:27| where is that coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17067)|
| 4:44:29| That comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17069)|
| 4:44:31| the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17071)|
| 4:44:33| data. So, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17073)|
| 4:44:35| update this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17075)|
| 4:44:37| every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17077)|
| 4:44:39| So, in between, moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17079)|
| 4:44:41| and high is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17081)|
| 4:44:43| And, it's based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17083)|
| 4:44:45| number of active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17085)|
| 4:44:47| cases per 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| and also positivity rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17089)|
| 4:44:51| So, the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17091)|
| 4:44:53| guidance that the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17093)|
| 4:44:55| adjusted on August 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17095)|
| 4:44:57| I think, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17097)|
| 4:44:59| what they referenced. They said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17099)|
| 4:45:01| to universal mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17101)|
| 4:45:03| even vaccinated, due to high community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17103)|
| 4:45:05| transmission. That's what they were basing it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17105)|
| 4:45:07| And so, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17107)|
| 4:45:09| to be true to that guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17109)|
| 4:45:11| which also funnels down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17111)|
| 4:45:13| to the Tennessee Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17113)|
| 4:45:15| to use that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17115)|
| 4:45:17| the metric, because it's readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17117)|
| 4:45:19| Anybody can see it publicly online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17119)|
| 4:45:21| I guess I would want to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17121)|
| 4:45:23| I honestly had no idea what you were talking about. I mean, I don't look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17123)|
| 4:45:25| at the Tennessee Health Department. I know some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17125)|
| 4:45:27| have all got their different places they're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| So, I think that that does need to be referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17129)|
| 4:45:31| where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17131)|
| 4:45:33| yellow moderate transmission is tied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17133)|
| 4:45:35| And, I mean, I just think that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17135)|
| 4:45:37| added, just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17137)|
| 4:45:39| personally, I didn't know. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17139)|
| 4:45:41| a little confused about that. And, I guess, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17141)|
| 4:45:43| would be another question, just thinking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| all these different things, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17145)|
| 4:45:47| does TWSAA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17147)|
| 4:45:49| things? Like, I know last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17149)|
| 4:45:51| basketball, the sports, were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17151)|
| 4:45:53| wearing masks, even when we had mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17153)|
| 4:45:55| And, we are saying in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17155)|
| 4:45:57| indoors. So, I guess that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17157)|
| 4:45:59| another question I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17159)|
| 4:46:01| bring up to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17161)|
| 4:46:03| I will say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| and I think we all come from very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17165)|
| 4:46:07| districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17167)|
| 4:46:09| makeup. I mean, we have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17169)|
| 4:46:11| different district, and we're made up of very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17171)|
| 4:46:13| constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17173)|
| 4:46:15| And, I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17175)|
| 4:46:17| I've kind of looked at our emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17177)|
| 4:46:19| and I listen to our speakers, and what it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17179)|
| 4:46:21| confirms for me is how split our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17181)|
| 4:46:23| is over this. I mean, that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17183)|
| 4:46:25| every time somebody brings this up, and every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17185)|
| 4:46:27| somebody tells me they've got the answer for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17187)|
| 4:46:29| I'm like, no, you have your answer for it, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17189)|
| 4:46:31| I will tell you, whatever your answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17191)|
| 4:46:33| is going to make just as many people mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17193)|
| 4:46:35| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17195)|
| 4:46:37| I'm a little bit like Patty Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17197)|
| 4:46:39| I kind of come from another district where, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17199)|
| 4:46:41| it's split, and I get different opinions, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17201)|
| 4:46:43| really have a lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17203)|
| 4:46:45| are asking for more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17205)|
| 4:46:47| and they're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17207)|
| 4:46:49| the mask mandate, and I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17209)|
| 4:46:51| look at who I value the opinion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17211)|
| 4:46:53| and I do value the opinion of, like, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17213)|
| 4:46:55| Childs. I know you spoke to him, but, like, I watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17215)|
| 4:46:57| the Facebook Live, which I thought was a great thing the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17217)|
| 4:46:59| and at the end of the day, he recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17219)|
| 4:47:01| masks at the end as the best way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17221)|
| 4:47:03| mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17223)|
| 4:47:05| COVID spread. I mean, I listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17225)|
| 4:47:07| I do value the Health Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17227)|
| 4:47:09| Knox County. I do value the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17229)|
| 4:47:11| Tennessee Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17231)|
| 4:47:13| So that is who I look to. I have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17233)|
| 4:47:15| of pediatrician friends and doctor friends that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17235)|
| 4:47:17| reached out to me. They all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17237)|
| 4:47:19| want us to be doing more, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17239)|
| 4:47:21| I do look at the fact that, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17241)|
| 4:47:23| do think it is a little hypocrisy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17243)|
| 4:47:25| of everybody that runs around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17245)|
| 4:47:27| and does everything differently in their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17247)|
| 4:47:29| community, and, you know, they go to church and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17249)|
| 4:47:31| do it or whatever, but kids do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17251)|
| 4:47:33| a choice about where they go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17253)|
| 4:47:35| You have a choice of your kids' after-school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17255)|
| 4:47:37| activities. You have a choice of going to church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17257)|
| 4:47:39| or not going to church. Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17259)|
| 4:47:41| now, our kids really do not have a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17261)|
| 4:47:43| as far as public education goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| and so that is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17265)|

| 4:47:49| added in here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17269)|
| 4:47:51| what the yellow is tied to, just to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17271)|
| 4:47:53| clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17273)|

| 4:48:01| go off of something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17281)|
| 4:48:03| Ms. Babb said. Students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17283)|
| 4:48:05| are required to be in school, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17285)|
| 4:48:07| also together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| for a much longer period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17289)|
| 4:48:11| of time than they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17291)|
| 4:48:13| in many of those other activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17293)|
| 4:48:15| and not just a longer period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17295)|
| 4:48:17| time for the day, but a longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17297)|

| 4:48:23| important when we're talking about spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17303)|
| 4:48:27| If we were asking our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17307)|
| 4:48:29| students to do something, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17309)|
| 4:48:31| ask them to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17311)|
| 4:48:33| they are more likely. When we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17313)|
| 4:48:35| hey, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17315)|
| 4:48:37| do it or not, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17317)|
| 4:48:39| not. If we were asking students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17319)|
| 4:48:41| to opt in to testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17321)|
| 4:48:43| we wouldn't be talking about test scores for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17323)|
| 4:48:45| As far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17325)|
| 4:48:47| as who's going to keep track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17327)|
| 4:48:49| the numbers of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17329)|
| 4:48:51| that our teachers track every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17331)|
| 4:48:53| is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17333)|
| 4:48:55| They have to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17335)|
| 4:48:57| every student in their classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17337)|
| 4:48:59| who can have their picture made, who can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17339)|
| 4:49:01| where they are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17341)|
| 4:49:03| reading and math and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17343)|
| 4:49:05| else, this is a very teeny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17345)|
| 4:49:07| tiny piece to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17347)|
| 4:49:09| into all the other data that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17349)|
| 4:49:15| As far as making that more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17355)|
| 4:49:17| difficult, there are so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17357)|
| 4:49:19| many ways for them to track that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17359)|
| 4:49:21| that they already have available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17361)|
| 4:49:23| them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17363)|
| 4:49:25| teachers asking us to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17365)|
| 4:49:27| please do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17367)|
| 4:49:29| I don't think that tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17369)|
| 4:49:31| piece for anyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17371)|
| 4:49:33| has talked to me has been a piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17373)|
| 4:49:35| And though we've heard a lot of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17375)|
| 4:49:37| we've also heard a lot of really wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17377)|
| 4:49:39| data, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17379)|
| 4:49:41| I'd like to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17381)|
| 4:49:43| just that's posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17383)|

| 4:49:51| data dashboard, it's downloadable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17391)|
| 4:49:53| everybody can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17393)|
| 4:49:55| And looking at it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17395)|
| 4:49:57| time, last year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17397)|
| 4:49:59| Knox County, just Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17399)|
| 4:50:01| just COVID positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17401)|
| 4:50:03| cases just for 5 to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17403)|
| 4:50:05| year olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17405)|
| 4:50:07| Our very highest point was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17407)|
| 4:50:09| 103 cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17409)|
| 4:50:11| and that was on December 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17411)|
| 4:50:13| There was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17413)|
| 4:50:15| other day that was close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17415)|
| 4:50:17| The days around it, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17417)|
| 4:50:19| next highest that I saw right off was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17419)|
| 4:50:21| around 80, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17421)|
| 4:50:23| 103 cases on December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17423)|
| 4:50:25| 17th was our peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17425)|
| 4:50:27| Yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17427)|
| 4:50:29| in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17429)|
| 4:50:31| for 5 to 18 year olds, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17431)|
| 4:50:33| 217 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17433)|
| 4:50:35| So more than double,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17435)|
| 4:50:37| and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17437)|
| 4:50:39| barely a month into school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17439)|
| 4:50:41| For the last 7 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17441)|
| 4:50:43| I want to be sure you understand that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17443)|
| 4:50:45| an anomaly, because for the last 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17445)|
| 4:50:47| days, there have been over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17447)|
| 4:50:49| 130 cases every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17449)|
| 4:50:51| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17451)|
| 4:50:53| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17453)|
| 4:50:55| we are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17455)|
| 4:50:57| exponential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17457)|
| 4:50:59| We are looking at a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17459)|
| 4:51:01| number compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17461)|
| 4:51:03| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17463)|
| 4:51:05| to consider that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17465)|
| 4:51:07| any mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17467)|
| 4:51:09| that's layered is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17469)|
| 4:51:11| I don't even understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17471)|
| 4:51:13| And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17473)|
| 4:51:15| keep talking about deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17475)|
| 4:51:17| I'm not sure why we keep talking about deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17477)|
| 4:51:19| because there's so many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17479)|
| 4:51:21| impacts to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17481)|
| 4:51:23| But while we're comparing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17483)|
| 4:51:25| last year and this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17485)|
| 4:51:27| statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17487)|
| 4:51:29| as of today, 16 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17489)|
| 4:51:31| and the numbers are going to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17491)|
| 4:51:33| age-wise because they're tracked differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17493)|
| 4:51:35| 16 children between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17495)|
| 4:51:37| 0 and 20 have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17497)|
| 4:51:39| Of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17499)|
| 4:51:41| 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17501)|
| 4:51:43| of those 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17503)|
| 4:51:45| died just in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17505)|
| 4:51:51| Those are numbers we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17511)|
| 4:51:53| to seriously think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17513)|
| 4:51:57| Because for this whole time that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17517)|
| 4:51:59| talking about COVID, there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17519)|
| 4:52:01| 16 deaths, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17521)|
| 4:52:03| 6 of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17523)|
| 4:52:05| just in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17525)|

| 4:52:11| Ms. Irwin. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17531)|

| 4:52:15| Chair. So I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17535)|
| 4:52:17| that we, the perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17537)|
| 4:52:19| that, so as the individual that brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17539)|

| 4:52:23| in 2020 had no idea this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17543)|
| 4:52:25| going to be the case. If we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17545)|
| 4:52:27| go back, I don't know what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17547)|
| 4:52:29| But I really do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17549)|
| 4:52:31| look at last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17551)|
| 4:52:33| when we were in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17553)|
| 4:52:35| space of August 2020 when we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17555)|
| 4:52:37| no idea of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17557)|
| 4:52:39| And we just moved forward. I was adamant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17559)|
| 4:52:41| against opening schools, but we did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17561)|
| 4:52:43| and we did it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17563)|
| 4:52:45| Now I know there's so many other factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17565)|
| 4:52:47| outside of our hand, outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17567)|
| 4:52:49| of our control that has us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17569)|
| 4:52:51| in a place to where we just can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17571)|
| 4:52:53| mimic last year, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17573)|
| 4:52:55| is really frustrating because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17575)|
| 4:52:57| we had a year of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17577)|
| 4:52:59| evidence that worked well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17579)|
| 4:53:01| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17581)|
| 4:53:03| this start of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17583)|
| 4:53:05| year has been more chaotic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17585)|
| 4:53:07| than the start of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17587)|
| 4:53:09| school year of August 2020 when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17589)|
| 4:53:11| we had no idea about any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17591)|
| 4:53:13| And I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17593)|
| 4:53:15| how we got there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17595)|
| 4:53:17| slash why we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17597)|
| 4:53:19| trying to mitigate to get some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17599)|
| 4:53:21| of level of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17601)|
| 4:53:23| or just to ease the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17603)|
| 4:53:25| chaos. And we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17605)|
| 4:53:27| know what that looks like, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17607)|
| 4:53:29| my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17609)|
| 4:53:31| perspective isn't necessarily mask or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17611)|
| 4:53:33| mask. My perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17613)|
| 4:53:35| is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17615)|
| 4:53:37| teachers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17617)|
| 4:53:39| wiped right now. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17619)|
| 4:53:41| I'm really concerned that by the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17621)|
| 4:53:43| of the school this semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17623)|
| 4:53:45| we're going to see a breaking point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17625)|
| 4:53:47| in some of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17627)|
| 4:53:49| that I'm not sure if we'll be able to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17629)|
| 4:53:51| back from like the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17631)|
| 4:53:53| population and getting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17633)|
| 4:53:55| back into building our pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17635)|
| 4:53:57| to educators. We lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17637)|
| 4:53:59| educators every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17639)|
| 4:54:01| even without COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17641)|
| 4:54:03| So I'm just really concerned that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17643)|
| 4:54:05| taking care of our teachers. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17645)|
| 4:54:07| it means just the mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17647)|
| 4:54:09| for the, or a mask option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17649)|
| 4:54:11| call it whatever you want, you want to call it a mandate, call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17651)|
| 4:54:13| an option. But if that's what the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17653)|
| 4:54:15| need and that's what they're communicating to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17655)|
| 4:54:17| hey, if I have to come into this building every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17657)|
| 4:54:19| day with sickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17659)|
| 4:54:21| kids, I want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17661)|
| 4:54:23| have some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17663)|
| 4:54:25| protection. And if that is what a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17665)|
| 4:54:27| needs at this point when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17667)|
| 4:54:29| 18 days in, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17669)|
| 4:54:31| us as a board have to give that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17671)|
| 4:54:33| option and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17673)|
| 4:54:35| Because we did have it last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17675)|
| 4:54:37| and we don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17677)|
| 4:54:39| it worked or not, but I do know it was less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17679)|
| 4:54:41| chaotic than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17681)|
| 4:54:43| So if we put that back to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17683)|
| 4:54:45| how it flows, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17685)|
| 4:54:47| that's giving a level of respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17687)|
| 4:54:49| our educators more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17689)|
| 4:54:51| But I'm really concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17691)|
| 4:54:53| the aftermath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17693)|
| 4:54:55| of this first month of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17695)|
| 4:54:57| some of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17697)|
| 4:54:59| Because we have, and we don't have subs, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17699)|
| 4:55:01| a lot of openings right now. There's kids sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17701)|
| 4:55:03| in auditoriums just because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17703)|
| 4:55:05| no teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17705)|
| 4:55:07| available because they're sick or there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17707)|
| 4:55:09| just vacancies. And that's a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17709)|
| 4:55:11| reality. So that's where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17711)|
| 4:55:13| I'm open to whatever that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17713)|
| 4:55:15| to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17715)|
| 4:55:17| But I think we owe it to our teachers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17717)|
| 4:55:19| at least try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17719)|
| 4:55:21| Thank you, Ms. Batterfield. Mr. Jin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17721)|
| 4:55:23| I think you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17723)|
| 4:55:25| Thank you, Madam Chair. I had a whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17725)|
| 4:55:27| prepared, but I don't think it's really appropriate now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17727)|
| 4:55:29| based off all the conversation that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17729)|
| 4:55:31| had. Of course, as student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17731)|
| 4:55:33| representative, the first thing I would like to say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17733)|
| 4:55:35| yes, currently when you walk around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17735)|
| 4:55:37| obviously it varies from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17737)|
| 4:55:39| The kind of general consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17739)|
| 4:55:41| I can feel is that you have maybe 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17741)|
| 4:55:43| 20, possibly 30% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17743)|
| 4:55:45| students masked as it currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17745)|
| 4:55:47| is with our recommendation policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17747)|
| 4:55:49| But I do, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17749)|
| 4:55:51| like I said last meeting, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17751)|
| 4:55:53| do think that if you had a mandate or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17753)|
| 4:55:55| at least some prerogative that suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17755)|
| 4:55:57| the board would really, really want students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17757)|
| 4:55:59| to wear a mask, that more students would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17759)|
| 4:56:01| I was actually talking to a friend of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17761)|
| 4:56:03| I think it was two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17763)|
| 4:56:05| at an SGA meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17765)|
| 4:56:07| they were not wearing masks, but they were telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17767)|
| 4:56:09| when they went to Kroger and they saw a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17769)|
| 4:56:11| of older people, they would put a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17771)|
| 4:56:13| They also told me that they had no issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17773)|
| 4:56:15| with a board passing a mandate and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17775)|
| 4:56:17| if the board did pass a mandate, they would wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17777)|
| 4:56:19| and follow that guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17779)|
| 4:56:21| So just put that there. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17781)|
| 4:56:23| talking to Ms. Owens' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17783)|
| 4:56:25| I guess kind of what Ms. Owens was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17785)|
| 4:56:27| yes, not a lot of students are wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17787)|
| 4:56:29| right now, but if we did put this policy in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17789)|
| 4:56:31| many more would. Yes, there's an opt-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17791)|
| 4:56:33| but even then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17793)|
| 4:56:35| we have 10, 20, 30 right now with a mandate in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17795)|
| 4:56:37| maybe have 50, 60, 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17797)|
| 4:56:39| Not 100%. It's much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17799)|
| 4:56:41| We'll have a much better job of protecting students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17801)|
| 4:56:43| so that they don't have to go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17803)|
| 4:56:45| and isolate, they don't have a lower chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17805)|
| 4:56:47| of getting sick, and then that way they can stay in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17807)|
| 4:56:49| in school and properly learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17809)|
| 4:56:51| so that we don't have that whole virtual learning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17811)|
| 4:56:53| We know we had issues with virtual learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17813)|
| 4:56:55| last year. We don't want to repeat that again, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17815)|
| 4:56:57| If we want to keep students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17817)|
| 4:56:59| in school, in person, then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17819)|
| 4:57:01| right now the best option is the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17821)|
| 4:57:03| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17823)|
| 4:57:05| Ms. Babb's point about the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17825)|
| 4:57:07| that Ms. Bounds and Ms. Christie brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17827)|
| 4:57:09| about students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17829)|
| 4:57:11| going to swim competitions, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17831)|
| 4:57:13| or what have you, and not wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17833)|
| 4:57:15| masks, like Ms. Babb said, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17835)|
| 4:57:17| reiterate this. Students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17837)|
| 4:57:19| don't really have a choice of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17839)|
| 4:57:21| or not they want to go to school if they've already chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17841)|
| 4:57:23| in-person school, right? But they do have a choice of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17843)|
| 4:57:25| going to whatever other event that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17845)|
| 4:57:27| or their family thinks they should be comfortable going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17847)|
| 4:57:29| to. And so, since the main purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17849)|
| 4:57:31| of a mask is to protect other students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17851)|
| 4:57:33| and not necessarily to protect one's self,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17853)|
| 4:57:35| then I think if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17855)|
| 4:57:37| a responsibility to ensure that all students have a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17857)|
| 4:57:39| learning environment, so that they can properly learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17859)|
| 4:57:41| then we should implement practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17861)|
| 4:57:43| that will protect those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17863)|
| 4:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17865)|
| 4:57:47| Thank you, Mr. Jin. Mr. Watson, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17867)|
| 4:57:49| I go to you, can I, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17869)|
| 4:57:51| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17871)|
| 4:57:53| number that you cited, the 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17873)|
| 4:57:55| children that had died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17875)|
| 4:57:57| can you give me that stat again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17877)|
| 4:57:59| They're ages 0 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17879)|
| 4:58:01| And is that for the state of Tennessee? That's for the state, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17881)|
| 4:58:03| And that was for what time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17883)|
| 4:58:05| 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17885)|
| 4:58:07| since the beginning of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17887)|
| 4:58:09| 6 during August of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17889)|
| 4:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17891)|
| 4:58:13| 16 in the state, and 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17893)|
| 4:58:15| have been since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17895)|
| 4:58:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17897)|
| 4:58:19| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17899)|
| 4:58:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17901)|
| 4:58:23| One of the big data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17903)|
| 4:58:25| for me is, I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17905)|
| 4:58:27| two days ago, the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17907)|
| 4:58:29| out with active COVID in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17909)|
| 4:58:31| Schools was 807,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17911)|
| 4:58:33| which, from my understanding, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17913)|
| 4:58:35| 3.5 times higher than any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17915)|
| 4:58:37| point last year in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17917)|
| 4:58:39| And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17919)|
| 4:58:41| heard, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17921)|
| 4:58:43| with Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17923)|
| 4:58:45| Christie that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17925)|
| 4:58:47| there is some management concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17927)|
| 4:58:49| about how this would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17929)|
| 4:58:51| I spoke with Williamson County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17931)|
| 4:58:53| who's implemented an opt-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17933)|
| 4:58:55| policy with their elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17935)|
| 4:58:57| since the beginning of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17937)|
| 4:58:59| And what they're seeing is about, on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17939)|
| 4:59:01| across all their elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17941)|
| 4:59:03| about a 25% opt-out rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17943)|
| 4:59:05| Which, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17945)|
| 4:59:07| we're pretty confident that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17947)|
| 4:59:09| way more people would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17949)|
| 4:59:11| And I think part of that, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17951)|
| 4:59:13| is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17953)|
| 4:59:15| it's that peer influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17955)|
| 4:59:17| right? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17957)|
| 4:59:19| I'm sure that there are students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17959)|
| 4:59:21| whose parents say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17961)|
| 4:59:23| hey, we want you to mass today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17963)|
| 4:59:25| And they show up at school, and they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17965)|
| 4:59:27| two or three classes, and they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17967)|
| 4:59:29| but I don't know if I want to be that kid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17969)|
| 4:59:31| And so they take it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17971)|
| 4:59:33| right? And a parent doesn't know any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17973)|
| 4:59:35| better than that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17975)|
| 4:59:37| I think we have to remember the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17977)|
| 4:59:39| that we're working with, that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17979)|
| 4:59:41| a lot of social conditioning and a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17981)|
| 4:59:43| of peer influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17983)|
| 4:59:45| I spoke to Dr. Buchanan today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17985)|
| 4:59:47| and referenced this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17987)|
| 4:59:49| and she asked her thoughts on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17989)|
| 4:59:51| referenced the Williamson County numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17991)|
| 4:59:53| and she said, yeah, 25%, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17993)|
| 4:59:55| of opting out, that means you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17995)|
| 4:59:57| 75% that are, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17997)|
| 4:59:59| would that make a difference? I said, would that make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=17999)|
| 5:00:01| in our schools, likely, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18001)|
| 5:00:03| 25%, if we hit that same number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18003)|
| 5:00:05| She said, absolutely, without a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18005)|
| 5:00:07| difference, without a doubt, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18007)|
| 5:00:09| students in the schools, masking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18009)|
| 5:00:11| going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18011)|
| 5:00:13| And I also believe that more students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18013)|
| 5:00:15| present in the schools actually help some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18015)|
| 5:00:17| things that we were talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18017)|
| 5:00:19| I mean, we just implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18019)|
| 5:00:21| a first reading of a policy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18021)|
| 5:00:23| students to be counted present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18023)|
| 5:00:25| when they're not in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18025)|
| 5:00:27| physically, and then we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18027)|
| 5:00:29| passed an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18029)|
| 5:00:31| for teachers in isolation to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18031)|
| 5:00:33| to have additional sick days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18033)|
| 5:00:35| Those things would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18035)|
| 5:00:37| necessarily on the table if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18037)|
| 5:00:39| we had way less infection in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18039)|
| 5:00:41| And also, I've heard this point many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18041)|
| 5:00:43| many times in our board meetings about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18043)|
| 5:00:45| what other people are doing all across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18045)|
| 5:00:47| county in other settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18047)|
| 5:00:49| I, for one, was only elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18049)|
| 5:00:51| to help oversee Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18051)|
| 5:00:53| Schools. We have no control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18053)|
| 5:00:55| over what people do at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18055)|
| 5:00:57| football games. I can't make my decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18057)|
| 5:00:59| based upon what happens at the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18059)|
| 5:01:01| swim meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18061)|
| 5:01:03| We don't have that purview. This is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18063)|
| 5:01:05| purview as Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18065)|
| 5:01:07| And I think, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18067)|
| 5:01:09| assume this is true, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18069)|
| 5:01:11| all of us have the goal of helping ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18071)|
| 5:01:13| that more students are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18073)|
| 5:01:15| school, in-person instruction this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18075)|
| 5:01:17| And to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18077)|
| 5:01:19| Ms. Owens' point, and Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18079)|
| 5:01:21| Satterfield's point, and Ms. Babs'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18081)|
| 5:01:23| point, what we did last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18083)|
| 5:01:25| year, in a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18085)|
| 5:01:27| degree, worked. And we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18087)|
| 5:01:29| have as many tools as we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18089)|
| 5:01:31| But this is a tool that we could implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18091)|
| 5:01:33| That, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18093)|
| 5:01:35| lots of people listen to different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18095)|
| 5:01:37| but if you listen to Dr. Childs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18097)|
| 5:01:39| and Dr. Piercy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18099)|
| 5:01:41| even Governor Lee stated it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18101)|
| 5:01:43| the 25th, if you want to listen to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18105)|
| 5:01:47| hey, you know, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18107)|
| 5:01:49| have your kids wear masks in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18109)|

| 5:01:53| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18113)|
| 5:01:55| to me, that's like the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18115)|
| 5:01:57| consideration, is how do we help keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18117)|
| 5:01:59| kids in school for learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18119)|
| 5:02:01| which also reduces the load on teachers at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18121)|
| 5:02:03| time, because they're in school, they're not having to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18123)|

| 5:02:07| who are out of school to do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18127)|
| 5:02:09| I don't know. I think that's an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18129)|
| 5:02:11| consideration. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18131)|
| 5:02:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18133)|

| 5:02:19| the data tonight from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18139)|

| 5:02:41| Shelby and these other counties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18161)|

| 5:02:45| holds true in studies across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18165)|

| 5:02:49| And to Daniel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18169)|
| 5:02:51| point that there's a lot of social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18171)|
| 5:02:53| conditioning, I would agree. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18173)|
| 5:02:55| a lot of social conditioning with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18175)|
| 5:02:57| adults when you go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18177)|
| 5:02:59| restaurant and watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18179)|
| 5:03:01| adults walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18181)|
| 5:03:03| the restaurant masked, take their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18183)|
| 5:03:05| mask off and sit there for an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18185)|
| 5:03:07| and eat their meal and put their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18187)|
| 5:03:09| mask on to walk back outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18189)|
| 5:03:11| So it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18191)|
| 5:03:13| kids that are socially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18193)|
| 5:03:15| conditioned. We as adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18195)|
| 5:03:17| have been socially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18197)|
| 5:03:19| conditioned over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18199)|
| 5:03:21| year by our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18201)|
| 5:03:23| My last point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18203)|
| 5:03:25| to Ms. Babb and Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18205)|
| 5:03:27| who made the point that school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18207)|
| 5:03:29| mandatory, and yes it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18209)|
| 5:03:31| but there also are other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18211)|
| 5:03:33| And the point I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18213)|
| 5:03:35| make is that yes, school is mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18215)|
| 5:03:37| and keeping students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18217)|
| 5:03:39| in masks for eight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18219)|
| 5:03:41| is harmful to children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18221)|
| 5:03:43| in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18223)|
| 5:03:45| I believe physically, socially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18225)|
| 5:03:47| and emotionally. The one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18227)|
| 5:03:49| thing I noticed tonight as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18229)|
| 5:03:51| listened and observed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18231)|
| 5:03:53| who came masked requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18233)|
| 5:03:55| a mask mandate was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18235)|
| 5:03:57| a lot of those people were gasping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18237)|
| 5:03:59| for breath. They could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18239)|
| 5:04:01| breathe as they talked and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18241)|
| 5:04:03| only could they not breathe, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18243)|
| 5:04:05| were muffled in their speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18245)|
| 5:04:07| And that transfers to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18247)|
| 5:04:09| who cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18249)|
| 5:04:11| breathe fresh air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18251)|
| 5:04:13| during the day for eight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18253)|
| 5:04:15| and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18255)|
| 5:04:17| gasp for the same air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18257)|
| 5:04:19| And they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18259)|
| 5:04:21| are muffled in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18261)|
| 5:04:23| speech and their teachers are muffled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| in their speech. And having taught kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18265)|
| 5:04:27| and first, I reiterate what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18267)|
| 5:04:29| heard so many times about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18269)|
| 5:04:31| importance of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18271)|
| 5:04:33| children being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18273)|
| 5:04:35| learn to read by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18275)|
| 5:04:37| hearing and seeing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18277)|
| 5:04:39| teachers. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18279)|
| 5:04:41| I mean, we can debate this all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18281)|
| 5:04:43| I don't even know why we're back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18283)|
| 5:04:45| again. And my final point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18285)|
| 5:04:47| it continues to divide our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18287)|
| 5:04:49| community and cause parents anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18289)|
| 5:04:51| We do have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18291)|

| 5:05:03| You did? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18303)|
| 5:05:05| I didn't motion it. Yeah, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18305)|

| 5:05:17| Do we have any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18317)|
| 5:05:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18319)|

| 5:06:12| Thank you. I'm so sorry. Motion fails. Let me get that right. I think my brain starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18372)|
| 5:06:19| turning off at 10. So it's 1047. Thank you. I'm glad y'all are paying attention. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18379)|
| 5:06:24| you. Item 10 was withdrawn. Item 11, discussion and possible action regarding COVID-19 contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18384)|
| 5:06:33| tracing protocols for the 2021-2022 school year. Make the motion. I move. I move. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18393)|
| 5:06:49| Do you? I'm sorry. Is there? Everybody's confused at 1047. This says discussion and possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18409)|
| 5:06:55| action. Correct. So we don't need a second. Why don't you go ahead? Well, we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18415)|
| 5:06:59| a motion. Right. But if you would like to speak to it, you can and then make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18419)|
| 5:07:05| or you can make a motion. Either one. Yes. So I'm the reason I asked for this is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18425)|
| 5:07:11| the thing that I've heard the most confusion about in the community is how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18431)|
| 5:07:15| contact tracing. And I think it's important for the administration to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18435)|
| 5:07:19| to publicly to spell that out. And I've talked to Mr. Myers about this well in advance so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18439)|
| 5:07:24| he can be prepared to do that. So I would move that we allow for that discussion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18444)|
| 5:07:32| Mr. Myers. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Mr. Watson. Yeah. So the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18452)|
| 5:07:41| really just sort of outlined the difference between how we went through contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18461)|
| 5:07:47| last school year versus what we're doing this school year. So and I will keep this brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18467)|
| 5:07:54| but last school year, how he described it of us doing contact tracing is a 100% accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18474)|
| 5:08:01| description of it. Okay. Our health services staff or nurses did an amazing job and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18481)|
| 5:08:08| carried that burden. And we, we obviously worked with the health department. They trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18488)|
| 5:08:12| our staff to do it. They provided us with additional staff specifically to help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18492)|
| 5:08:18| us in that endeavor. So I want to be clear, we were doing it in partnership with the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18498)|
| 5:08:23| department, but in terms of overseeing the investigation, determining who was a contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18503)|
| 5:08:30| who wasn't a contact, the policing of contact tracing, once we identified who those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18510)|
| 5:08:37| were, fell entirely to, to school staff. Again, our school nurses put in astronomical hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18517)|
| 5:08:46| to get that done for our district. I mean, seven days a week. I don't know when Lisa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18526)|
| 5:08:54| Wagner and her staff rested and when they recharged. Our administration was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18534)|
| 5:09:00| in that as well. So school principals, assistant principals spending time during the day to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18540)|
| 5:09:05| go through and look at classrooms, measure desks, see how far desks were apart, review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18545)|
| 5:09:12| video to see who was sitting next to whom during, during lunch. Look, even trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18552)|
| 5:09:18| see if there was video, maybe of practices to see which athletes were standing next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18558)|
| 5:09:22| which athletes so that we could go through and contact trace and do all that work. Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18562)|
| 5:09:29| of course we would reach out to families and inform them that their child was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18569)|
| 5:09:34| be placed in quarantine because we've gone through the investigative process and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18574)|
| 5:09:40| had met the criteria to be quarantined. And you all remember very much what that was like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18580)|
| 5:09:45| last year, which is where I think that part of us placing folks in quarantine, acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18585)|
| 5:09:50| as agents of the health department, essentially placing folks in quarantine. We know the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18590)|
| 5:09:55| that that placed on our student attendance, their ability to participate not just in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18595)|
| 5:10:00| but in their extracurriculars. And we also know how that impacted our staffing in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18600)|
| 5:10:05| of having to place teachers in quarantine, whether it be because they had a meeting or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18605)|
| 5:10:11| just a close interaction with a student, whatever the case may be. So last year, the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18611)|
| 5:10:18| difference would be that investigative piece of truly contact tracing, determining who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18618)|
| 5:10:26| was next to whom and for how long, and then making the determination that that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18626)|
| 5:10:33| needs to be placed in quarantine. And then again, making that contact with family to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18633)|
| 5:10:40| place them there. How that contrasts for this year is that, you know, the Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18640)|
| 5:10:46| Ed and the State Department of Health sent out joint communication to schools. Contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18646)|
| 5:10:52| tracing is the responsibility of the Department of Health. And our role in that is to, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18652)|
| 5:10:58| to support them through providing them with information. We are constantly in ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18658)|
| 5:11:05| communication with the health department. Dr. Buchanan and her team have been great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18665)|
| 5:11:10| partners over the last two years as we've worked through this pandemic. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18670)|
| 5:11:14| that I've ever called her team and they've not answered. And I don't know that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18674)|
| 5:11:18| ever called us and we've not answered. So we continue to work closely with the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18678)|
| 5:11:24| department and collaborate on the best possible ways for us to provide them the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18684)|
| 5:11:30| they need in order to contact trace. Is that process perfect? It is not perfect. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18690)|
| 5:11:38| why we continually work to improve that process so that we can get the information they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18698)|
| 5:11:45| in their hands as quickly as we can so that they can go through the process of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18705)|
| 5:11:50| tracing however they see best fit to do it, which means, again, they would have ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18710)|
| 5:11:56| of making contacts to families of students who they have identified as being a close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18716)|
| 5:12:04| contact. So that, I think, makes fairly clear the major difference, right? The biggest difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18724)|
| 5:12:13| is that ownership piece of conducting the full investigation, determining that Ms. Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18733)|
| 5:12:18| and I have been too close for each other for too long, so she's going to have to get quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18738)|
| 5:12:22| and then we're going to call her guardians and say, hey, this is such and such from Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18742)|
| 5:12:26| County Schools, your child's being quarantined. That is, to me, the biggest difference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18746)|
| 5:12:33| this year, sharing that information. Thank you, Mr. Myers. And I spoke with some nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18753)|
| 5:12:40| and I just, you know, just asked for their opinion. And it sounds like you've mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18760)|
| 5:12:47| that they worked just astronomical hours. I mean, I, basically, my conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18767)|
| 5:12:52| them, you know, it was something like this. We did it last year. They predict a mass exodus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18772)|
| 5:13:00| of nurses if we require that again this year. And, you know, I think about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18780)|
| 5:13:05| every single time we talk about the budget, we always say we need more nurses. So last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18785)|
| 5:13:10| year, we expected them to do their job, plus we expected them to do the job of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18790)|
| 5:13:15| tracing, which is another full-time job. So I don't see how, and I understand that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18795)|
| 5:13:22| are frustrated with this whole topic. I don't see how we could ask our nurses to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18802)|
| 5:13:27| again this year. It just is not sustainable, in my opinion, and from their expert opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18807)|
| 5:13:33| And then the other thing they went on to say is that, you know, they, hey, those, I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18813)|
| 5:13:38| to three nurses and they really felt like those, the kids need to be in school unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18818)|
| 5:13:43| they actually are sick. So that was, you know, their expert opinion on that. So, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18823)|
| 5:13:50| that's my concern. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18830)|
| 5:13:53| A couple things. I mean, I do believe that it is the Knox County Health Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18833)|
| 5:13:57| job to contact trace. I think we kind of went above and beyond last year, but that is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18837)|
| 5:14:03| they are charged to do. That is their job. I do think we need to be cooperating with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18843)|
| 5:14:07| them. So a couple of questions around that, because I do think some things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18847)|
| 5:14:11| I think that's where our parents are very confused about what our role is. So my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18851)|
| 5:14:17| and you correct me, is that we are, as we are finding out about teachers and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18857)|
| 5:14:23| having COVID, we are letting the health department know, because that's the big concern I'm having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18863)|
| 5:14:28| hearing from parents is the health department, you know, I had a friend who went back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18868)|
| 5:14:32| work from having a diagnosed case called the health department. It hadn't even been reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18872)|
| 5:14:37| through CVS to them. So just the fact that, what are we doing as far as sharing information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18877)|
| 5:14:45| Because I think that's a little bit what parents are wanting to know, is what are we sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18885)|
| 5:14:49| There was a big article in the paper that we were not giving class information. It sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18889)|
| 5:14:54| like we are. I mean, I just want to hear from y'all what we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18894)|
| 5:14:57| Sure. And I can definitely address that. So the biggest thing, I know there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18897)|
| 5:15:01| early reports, you know, specifically with positive cases. Yeah, that's two-way communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18901)|
| 5:15:07| right now, right? So if we find out about a case for the health department, which it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18907)|
| 5:15:13| happens frequently, then yeah, we would certainly communicate that. And that's how we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18913)|
| 5:15:17| to, really in an effort to maintain the cleanest data set that we can, right? So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18917)|
| 5:15:24| in a perfect world, you know, we'd get that information from the health department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18924)|
| 5:15:29| take action. But, you know, the volume of tests and things makes that pretty difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18929)|
| 5:15:36| right? So we share that information back and forth. If it gets reported to us, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18936)|
| 5:15:40| to report it to them so that they have access to that information specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18940)|
| 5:15:49| You know, our expectation for staff from the beginning of the school year is that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18949)|
| 5:15:53| share any directory information with the Department of Health if they asked for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18953)|
| 5:16:01| right? And for us, really that's anything that's in our student information system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18961)|
| 5:16:05| I know there's been a lot of questions specifically surrounding seating charts. Seating charts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18965)|
| 5:16:13| were not an established expectation at the start of the school year for teachers. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18973)|
| 5:16:17| didn't say to teachers, again, unlike last year where we said, hey, let's make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18977)|
| 5:16:22| we're assigning seats to the greatest extent that we can, right? So kids had assigned seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18982)|
| 5:16:27| in the cafeteria, in all their classes. I don't speak for transportation, so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18987)|
| 5:16:32| know if they had them on buses or not. But those existed on a large scale because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18992)|
| 5:16:39| expectation was established with staff on the front end. We have no expectation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=18999)|
| 5:16:43| staff would maintain seating charts. And as such, if a seating chart doesn't exist, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19003)|
| 5:16:50| not a seating chart to be shared. What I can guarantee you is that if we get a call and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19010)|
| 5:16:58| the health department asks us for a seating chart or a class roster and that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19018)|
| 5:17:04| we have that information, there is no reason that we would not share that with them. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19024)|
| 5:17:09| if they've requested seating charts and they've been told no, it is because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19029)|
| 5:17:14| them. If we have that information, that is information that we would share with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19034)|
| 5:17:19| We would happily share it. So that directory information would also include phone, email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19039)|
| 5:17:26| and address information. I've learned not to refer to that as contact information because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19046)|
| 5:17:29| that gets misinterpreted as we've identified you as a contact. But we would share any and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19049)|
| 5:17:35| all of that information with the health department. Again, Lisa Wagner and her team are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19055)|
| 5:17:43| to make our sharing of that information as efficient as we possibly can. And it is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19063)|
| 5:17:51| ongoing process because this process is different than it was last year. Because last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19071)|
| 5:17:56| we were collecting our own information for us to use to identify the cases and close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19076)|
| 5:18:02| contacts ourselves, right? So certainly, you know, we're going to continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19082)|
| 5:18:09| the health department. We've talked to Dr. Buchanan and her team on Tuesday. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19089)|
| 5:18:15| we talked to them today. We've got another meeting with them tomorrow. So certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19095)|
| 5:18:20| we have not cut each other out of our lives or anything like that, which I know seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19100)|
