| 0:02:29| So we'll get started. I'm Becky Wade. I'm the Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=149)|

| 0:02:44| But I want to introduce some of the staff members from our department. They're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| I feel very fortunate to have such dedicated and professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| folks on our team, and so a few people that are here tonight, if you would just wave. Beth Bacon is our Housing Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| Ken McMahon is our Economic Development Projects Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| From the Office on Homelessness, we have Mike Dunthorne, Homeless Program Coordinator, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| Sean Griffith, Homeless Program Coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| And from the Grants Management Team that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| besides Linda, we have Hope Ely, Senior Project Specialist, and Bailey Walker, Project Specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| I also want to recognize Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| She's here tonight, Chief Economic and Community Development Officer and Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| I'm very grateful for her leadership here at the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So moving along to the agenda, we will start with reviewing the Consolidated Plan, the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| We'll talk a little bit about our COVID-19 response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| the funds that we've received from the federal government, and how we've allocated those funds to date to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| respond to community needs that have been brought on by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| Then we'll get into the Annual Action Plan. We will talk about the resources we have to allocate to address some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| issues to date, the community engagement efforts we've done, other information that impact the plan, such as data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=250)|
| 0:04:19| We'll talk a little bit about the applications and the process we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And then we will present the proposed activities for 21-22 and the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| And then we'll have time for questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| But, you know, if you all want to interrupt throughout this, if you have a question you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| want to ask, please feel free to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| So first of all, we're in our 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| This is a required plan that jurisdictions that receive funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=292)|
| 0:05:00| have to submit to HUD in order to access those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| And the sources of funds we receive include CDBG, or Community Development Block Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| Home Investment Partnerships Grants, or HOME, and the Emergency Solutions Grants, or ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=312)|
| 0:05:21| Our Consolidated Plan is required to be submitted every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| It's a strategic plan that has no funding attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| It is just a planning tool for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| It involves extensive community participation with citizens and consultation with agencies and service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| It was submitted to HUD last August 2020, and it sets our priorities, both our high and low priorities, for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=343)|
| 0:05:53| So here are the priorities that came out of our Consolidated Planning process last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| Reduce and prevent homelessness, stabilize and revitalize neighborhoods, create economic opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| and enhance the availability, accessibility, and quality of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| So we work under this five-year plan. However, every year, we need to update it, and there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| As we all know, things change, and things come about that require us to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| For example, the pandemic that we are just still in the ending stages of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| You know, we had no way to predict that would happen, and so we update our Consolidated Plan on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=396)|
| 0:06:44| to allow for those challenges and different sources of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| So I'm going to let Linda talk about our COVID response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| So we have brought a lot of contracts and agreements to you over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| and we did this because we received quite a bit of funding through the CARES Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| and then we've learned about some other funding that is available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| But in covering the CARES Act, we received some Supplemental Emergency Solutions Grant, or ESG-CV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| We also received some Supplemental Community Development Block Grant, or CDBG-CV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| We got an initial allocation, round one funding, in April of last year of both the ESG-CV and the CDBG-CV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| And then just a couple of months later, in June, we learned about a round two of ESG-CV that we were receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| of about $2.2 million, and normally our allocation every year is about $150,000 in an Emergency Solutions Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=462)|
| 0:07:55| So getting $2.2 million on top of the $500,000 that we received in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I think it was close to 18 times what we normally get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| We also received another round, it was actually our second round, but it's called round three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| of Community Development Block Grant CV funds in September, of $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| Coming soon, we will be getting an allocation of ESG-CV through the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| Tennessee Housing Development Agency, for almost $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| And then we've also been notified that with the American Rescue Plan, or the HOME ARP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| we'll be getting about $4 million in HOME funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| So this will bring our total to about $10.4 million that we've received just for COVID-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| We've had some other funds, including our Homeless General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| The normal amount that we submit and you approve is for $201,000 each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| so we're counting two years of that because we're putting money towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Our normal, or annual ESG, and that is close to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Some of our unspent prior year Community Development Block Grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| and also the Emergency General Fund, $100,000 that was given to a nonprofit in the very early days of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| So we've had about $933,000 available besides just the federal money through the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| And we've allocated most percentage to homelessness, homelessness prevention, rapid rehousing, emergency shelter services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=582)|
| 0:09:52| and HMIS, which is the Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| We've also allocated some to workforce development, food support for vulnerable population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| and then we also have some funding for grants administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| So about $325,000 is still available to be allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| and so we're going to talk about that when we get to our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| So in terms of the percentage of money that we have awarded and the percentage of money that we've spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=621)|
| 0:10:30| most of it has been on homelessness prevention with our COVID-19 Housing Assistance Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| So almost 69% of the funds that have been spent were spent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| About 15, almost 15.5% on emergency shelter and services, and about 8% on rapid rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=642)|
| 0:10:53| and the remainder, about 7.7% on food delivery to vulnerable populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| Excuse me, Ms. Russ, could you go over those percentages again, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| starting with the Housing Assistance Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I'm sorry, for the Housing Assistance Program, it's 68.66% of the funds spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| And this is reporting through the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| In that same report period, we have served, I say we have served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| our nonprofit partners have served a little over 2,000 households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| and a little over 3,100 people in those households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| And the largest percentage were in emergency shelter and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| Then second is the Housing Assistance Program or homelessness prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| followed by rapid rehousing services, and then food delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Here you can see in the chart, we've got the number of people assisted that I just spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| and then we also broke it down for the race and ethnicity of the people assisted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| Can you all see this, these numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| We can send you this afterwards if you need those percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| So that was really the early money that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Then with the second allocations, we'll call it phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| was really in the fall and winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| And we received, or we had 1.99 million in ESG-CV round two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| and we had 1.9 million in ESG-CV round three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| and we had 1.9 million in ESG-CV round four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| 1.9 million in ESG-CV round two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| And we have just started, and I guess we started in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| It seems like it wasn't that long ago, but in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| we started with some of our first contracts for this phase two of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| In that, Becky's going to talk a little bit more about community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| but we had three meetings in the month of August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| when we were awarded all of this additional ESG-CV round two funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| We wanted to meet with the community, and we had three meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| to meet with different organizations that are providing social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| but also with some smaller grassroots organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| to make sure that they knew about the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and we knew about who they were serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| So we came up with, through those three meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| we came up with a list of funding priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| that included rental and utility assistance, or homelessness prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| street outreach to people who are experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| services to overcome language and cultural barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| emergency shelter improvements to be able to increase capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| and have safe barriers between people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| mobile, medicated, assisted treatment, and an equity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| So of those, and these were not in any particular priority over one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| but of those, we were able to, we funded street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| emergency shelter improvements, and an equity study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| but we also, instead of providing rent and utility assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| through homelessness prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| we changed to a category called rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| These are specific terms that have to do with categories of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| within the ESG program, and the difference between them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| they pay for a lot of the same things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| so paying for rent and utilities, both programs will pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| but the difference is that homelessness prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| is for people who are maybe still housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| but they are at risk of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| and rapid rehousing is for people who are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| that need to get back into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| So that's, it has, each one has different regulations and requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| and we ended up putting the money into rent and utility assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| then under rapid rehousing, and that was the largest percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| at almost 46% of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Ms. Russ, before you move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| could you expound a little bit about the equity study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| Yes, this is being accomplished through the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| through the Homelessness Management Information System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| and they have just started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I think their agreement before you was maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| I don't remember, maybe in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| but they will be looking at how the, it's called CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| and it's the Coordinated Entry System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| looking at how people are served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and whether there's any, whether they're finding any bias,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| and making sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| that people in our community who are disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| and who are more likely to suffer the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| of both the disease and the economy, economic consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| that we can make sure that our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| are being able to assist those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Phase two was the CDBG CV round three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| and we focused on supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| we were almost, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| decreasing what we were spending on the housing assistance program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| because other resources were presenting themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| including quite a bit of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I think the total is over $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| now to Knox County, and you may have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| the press release, the press conference earlier this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| talking about that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| it's Emergency Rental Assistance Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and with them, with the county having, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| over $40 million that will also serve city residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| we looked to find ways that we could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| the CARES Act funds to support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| and so being able to pay for deposits for rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| utility deposits, and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| is a way that we could support them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| also with case management and housing stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| so that's what we will be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| and I think you approved a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| this last week ago, Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| and you'll have another contract before you next Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Transitional housing and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| transitional housing and services for youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| and young adults is also a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| and we want to continue the food delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| to those vulnerable populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| who have a hard time getting out to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| mostly elderly and people with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| and even looking at doing an expansion of that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| physically expanding their kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And then the last is homeownership assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| we don't have that agreement quite ready for you yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| but we will be bringing these agreements to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| over the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And phase three we expect to happen this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| this is when we hope to receive some more direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| and guidance about how to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| those American Rescue Plan home dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| and also some more information through THDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| on spending the ESGCV funds through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| So you will be getting yet another, or maybe two more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| substantial amendments before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| You approved one this last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| We have to do that in order to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| to change the agreements that we had with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Whenever they add new money we have to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| you know, to change our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| and show what we're going to be doing with the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So what Linda's been presenting and talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| are the funds that we've received over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| solely focused on COVID relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| and how we've had to add those into our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| have contracts with agencies to perform the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| present substantial amendments to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| We've done three of those so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| and probably will do another two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| So we really appreciate you all sticking with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| understanding how we've had to make adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| and add a lot of contracts to our current load of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| So moving forward, this is the annual action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| for the 21-22 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Once again, we will be meeting our consolidated plan goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| reduce and prevent homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| stabilize and revitalize neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| create economic opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and enhance the availability, accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1184)|

| 0:19:50| Our year two of the five-year plan begins July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| and it ends June 30, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Our funding is allocated annually from HUD for this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| and it's appropriated through the federal budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| so this funding varies from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Even though we have a formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| based on our population and poverty and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| the funding varies from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| because Congress has to appropriate the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Our plan is due to HUD on May 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and then we do an annual report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| of all the accomplishments from the current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| and have to send that to HUD by September 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| and that's called the CAPER report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| So for the current year we're in now, for 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| those accomplishments will be reported to HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| this coming September 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| And that report is always posted on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I think we have almost every CAPER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| we've ever reported on on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| It's a great place where you can go and see what we've spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| what citizens we've assisted, demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| all kinds of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| In order to submit the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| we're required to engage the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| So we consult with our community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| and agencies and service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| We had three meetings in August focused on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| We had another meeting in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| focused on family and youth homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| January was our first public meeting discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| and then April 26 we had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| with homeless providers at the Mayor's Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| We also engaged citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| through a public participation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Like I said, our first public meeting was January the 14th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| and we are in the 30-day comment period right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| So once our draft plan is posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| we take comments for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| So, you know, at the end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| if you're interested in providing comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| all comments get submitted to HUD with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| We had another public meeting Tuesday night, April 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| And so in total, more than 111 unduplicated non-city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| have participated in our meetings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| We also look at data and this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| this illustrates just some differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| between 2019 and 2020 in requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| from the community for needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| You can see the total top requests for 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| was 2,519 through 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| And for 2020, it was 6,471| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| with the majority of the requests coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| about housing and shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| Just to break that down a little further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| most of the requests that came in were for rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| In 2020, as compared to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And the second highest was mortgage assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| And so fortunately, we were able to have projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| and the funding to provide the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| that was needed when the community called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| So that was some of the activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| that Linda spoke about through the COVID funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| that we had in place to serve people who were in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| So regarding the funding we have for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| we have been allocated 1,787,837| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| in community development block grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| And those are fairly flexible funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| However, they are all focused on low and moderate income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| citizens, households, and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| to provide decent housing, suitable living environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| and expanding economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| We also receive home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| This coming year, we'll get 1,124,871 in home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Those home funds can only be used for housing activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| either rental housing or home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And once again, that's focused on low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| and very low income households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| And then we receive our emergency solutions grants, or ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Our annual allocation for the coming year is 150,252.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| All those funds are focused on homeless programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| So you can see the list of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| that we can use those funds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Street outreach, emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| We can use those funds for street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| emergency shelter, operations and essential services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| rapid rehousing services, and then homeless prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| What determines the figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Like, how are the numbers determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Like the 1,124,871,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| they're determined by the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Are they based on population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Like, how do they arrive at the figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| There is a formula basis for every jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| that receives funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| It is based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| It's based on the poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| It's based on housing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| like the, you know, number of substandard units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| So there is a calculation that HUD goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| to calculate how much funding we're qualified to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| or eligible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| However, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| we have to fit into the federal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| So those numbers are never the full allocation of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| because just like every other city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| you know, we get knocked down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| because the budget is smaller than that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| So we really never know from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| exactly what our funds are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| until probably around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| well, until the budget's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| So this year it was in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Some years it's been in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Some years it's been after we've submitted our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So we, you know, we build our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| based on what we think it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| In this case, we actually had the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| so that was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And so the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| we also have city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| And while those funds are not going to be covered in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| we're very grateful to have affordable housing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| And you will see next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| in your city council agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| a new ordinance focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1622)|

| 0:27:08| And within that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| are the Affordable Rental Development Fund, or ARDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| That has been in existence since 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| and helped us develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| affordable housing throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| There's a new fund solely focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| on permanent supportive housing at 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| We will continue supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| the Austin Homes infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| for the redevelopment at the Austin Homes site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| And then the Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| at the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| They've been receiving city funds since 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| and they do a variety of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| throughout the city for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And we also receive homeless agency grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| through city general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| And we haven't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| reviewed the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| For the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| But when the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| proposed budget was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| $8 million was listed as the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| for the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Well, the ordinance itself says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| a minimum of $5 million annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| In this coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| what's being presented is $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| And that's those figures there you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| And would the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| a mixed income development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| would that still fit the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| The funding that goes from our ARDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| or Permanent Supportive Housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| any of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| they're focused on units that serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| very low or extremely low income persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| They may be part of a larger development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| that has market rate units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| But our funds are so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| are focused solely on the lower income units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| That was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| that was one thing that struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| because I know the next phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| for Austin Homes is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| 100% area median income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| And so I thought the intention behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| the ordinance coming before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| was to reach those very low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| That was one thing I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I didn't know if you had any clarification for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| The Austin Homes funds are going solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| not for the housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| So that's to serve the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| That's streets, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| lighting, park space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| the underground utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| stormwater, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| That's what's coming out of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| allocated to that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| So here's some historical information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| from the start of these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| CDBG and HOME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| The orange is CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| HOME is the darker blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| ESG is the dark green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| And then some other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| some local funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| and the state ESG is the light green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| But you can see how our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| have moved around a little bit over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| except for in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| that sharp increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| was our affordable rental development fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| with city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| And then these big peaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| came in in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| with all of our CARES Act money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| Okay, Linda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I'm going to talk to you a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| about the proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| then using our community development block grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| HOME and ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We also have some prior year unspent funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| and estimated program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| So for CDBG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| there's the grant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| that Becky spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Then we have about $550,609.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I have that in italics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| because I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| it includes the current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| and I'm not sure exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| what we're going to be spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| between now and the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| But that's my best estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| And then we also get program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| that comes through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| owner-occupied housing rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| And depending on if we get a payoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| or that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| that could fluctuate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Some years we get a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| than $100,000 in CDBG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| sometimes a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| But we estimate about $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| to make the total CDBG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| that'll be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| $2,438,446.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| With our HOME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| our federal allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| as Becky said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| was a little over a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| We have $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| in prior year funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| that have been unspent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| But that also includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| prior year program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| So we have quite a bit of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| that we need to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| and intend to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And then our estimated program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| for HOME is about a half a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| about $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| for a total amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| of $3,184,360 for HOME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| And then our emergency solutions grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| we don't have any prior year funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| and we don't receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| any program income from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| So that's the straight allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| of $150,000, $252,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| So our total federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| then in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| for our annual action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| for year two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| is $5,773,058.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| I'm just going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| real quickly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| our applications process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We received 16 applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| in our February cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| for about $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Four of those were COVID-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| so we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| our COVID-related funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Housing and homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| nine applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| for a little over $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| We had three that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| employment-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| workforce development-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| So meals, food support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| And then some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| like design and technical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| that would not be obviously COVID-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| and a pandemic needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| For our homeless grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| we received 15 applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| for about $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Five of those were COVID-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| and then three were related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| to rapid rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| two for street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| seven for emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| and two for homelessness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| There's a lot going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| on this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| but we're going to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| each of these sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| But this is how the budget breaks out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| for what we'll fund under those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| four priority goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| that Becky spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Affordable housing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| almost 76% of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Expanding economic opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| is about 6.5% of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Homelessness is 6.3% of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| But I want you to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| that we have all these COVID funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| that we will be spending on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| So this is not the only funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| that is going towards homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| This is just next year's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| For neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| we have about 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| based on going for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| blighted property stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| and other things that help to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| and stabilize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And our CDBG and ESG administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| is about 6.4% of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| For the rapid rehousing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| budgeted at $48,000 for 95 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| what costs are included in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Actually, those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| will be part of a larger project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| that will be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| with the COVID funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| But we wanted to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| to fund it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| So we've put some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| that will come in then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| after the new year starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| So rapid rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| it pays for things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| rent assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| utility assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| things that will move people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| who are experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| families who are experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| into stable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Do you have a sense of how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| additional funds would be added to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| I'm sorry, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Do you have a sense of how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| additional funds will be added to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Would it be twice as much or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| I'm trying to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| the total contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I think we're bringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| because these are new funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| and they're under a different source of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| this contract will come to you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| But it was included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| in our substantial amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| that you approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| And we should be bringing that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I believe May 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| for that rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| So it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I believe it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| the total is maybe 516,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| The 48,000 is on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| And it's hard to keep all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| COVID-related funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| and then this next year funding straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| But they're treated a little bit differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| because this is our next action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Are there any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Okay, we're going to go into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Sure, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| expanding economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| can you expound on that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Yes, I'm going to go through each of these sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Okay, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| First, let me just talk a little bit about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| and then we'll go into that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| So with this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| this shows the 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| well the percentage that was going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| affordable housing, the 75.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And then what is going towards those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| that we talked about in the earlier slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| And then of the breakdown of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| 86% is for owner-occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| And the reason that we focus our HUD funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| on owner-occupied housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| is because we have funds that Becky spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| local funds for rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| So we have a lot more funding to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| on rental housing in local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| So we're focusing our HUD funding then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| on affordable housing for homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| These are people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| already own their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| or want to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And then 13.7% is for rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| And then to break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| the owner-occupied housing a little bit further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| about 46% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| is for our owner-occupied housing rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| So these are for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| who are low to moderate income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| who live in a house that needs code-related repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| And we do whole house repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| So we spend almost half of our funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| in owner-occupied housing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Then we also, and let me just add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| that's also where our program income comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| that we talked about in the earlier slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| So years when we may get a little bit less funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| our program income can really help tide us over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Ms. Parker had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I was just wondering if you could speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| why the owner-occupied rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| is such a large focus of this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| We focus on owner-occupied housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| with our HUD dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| because we have a lot more local dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| like the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| that pay for affordable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| So we want to make sure that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| preventing people from losing their housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| if they own the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| That doesn't make them higher income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| You can be a low-income homeowner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| So we want to focus some of our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| on stabilizing those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| and also stabilizing the affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| And the cost of the program is high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| because when we do an owner-occupied rehab program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| we have to bring, because of federal regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| because we're using federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| we have to bring the whole house up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So we have to replace electrical systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| anything that doesn't meet code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| So the average cost for an owner-occupied rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| is probably around $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| It could be a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| We pay for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| while the family is living in another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| while the work is being done on their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| So that's included in this cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| And, you know, we don't do as many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| because they're costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| However, it provides a stable living environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| for that household going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| So it's great for sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| and keeping families located in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| because they can continue to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| The energy-efficient upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| make sure that they can pay their utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Does it include utility assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| It's just the whole house upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| But what we include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| is things like insulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| better windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| any kind of upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| that could lower their utility assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| a better heat and air system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| And I know I've asked this question before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| but I cannot remember the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Can you remind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| is there a requirement that they stay in the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| for a certain period of time after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Or the relationship is that they're expected to pay back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Well, the way it works is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| some of the funds are repaid to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| some are deferred payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| or means they're forgivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| If they move in year two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| they have to pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| As long as they stay there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| and continue to pay their taxes and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| then the forgivable loan is forgiven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| so they never have to pay that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| But we do recoup the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| and like Linda said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| for the payable part, that provides program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| but that's set at an extremely low interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and it's paid back over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| So there's a big incentive for the family to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Our goal with that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| is to keep their housing affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| so by lowering their utility expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| that helps them be able to stay there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| and use their income on other things that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| besides their housing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| It stabilizes the housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| but we can't make people stay in their housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| so if they need to sell or they need to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| we just make sure that we recoup the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| That is my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| that we just continue to monitor it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| because of the potential unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| that we are subsidizing the increased rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| in the housing market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| the increased prices of houses in our housing market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and helping to deplete our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| We've been doing this program for probably 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| and most of the households that we've assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| have stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| We haven't seen this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| but we'll be happy to make sure we monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Yeah, I think it'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| And this program doesn't pay for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| that are strictly cosmetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| This is a code-related expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| that will bring the house up to our housing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| so it's health and safety related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| We're not going in and just doing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| only for cosmetic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| It doesn't mean that if we fix a wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| or put a new window in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| to make the house more energy efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| we're not going to leave the wall unpainted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| so we'll correct that and fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| but there isn't anything that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| really that is just cosmetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| But it also helps to raise the value of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| because when you have that one house on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| that really needs repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| it not only helps the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| but it also helps the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| of the other houses on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And again, one reason why I ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| is just because there's such a focus on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| when we have such a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| with our growing population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| of folks experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| and it's always a concern to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| when I see that have such a smaller priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Well, it looks that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| These funds have very particular uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| For example, home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| which pays the majority of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| home funds, can only be used on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| We do focus our CDBG on homeless services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| but once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| we're capped at the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| that we can spend on public services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| through CDBG at 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| so we can't use all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| for homeless services either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| So it's a real dance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| around how we can use the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| to best serve the neighborhood needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| And when you say it can only be used for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| does that include supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| transitional housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| It could be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Well, it's important to understand, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| that people can become homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| because their housing is old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| and falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| It can be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| if your utility expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| in an out-of-date house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| make it so that you can't afford to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I mean, oftentimes utility expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| can be more than the cost of a mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| or people who have their house paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| but their utility bill is so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| You know, the people that we are assisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| with this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| are, you know, within the 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| and many of them are in the lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| you know, 0% to like 50% or 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| of area median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| So, you know, one way to prevent homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| is to help people not lose the housing that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I definitely absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| We just seem to prioritize that strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| The other things that we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| for owner-occupied housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| is we also have weatherization programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| and these are not loans that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| these are not funded through loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| but they are grants to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| if the work is less than $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| so we can make emergency home repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| without them having to take on a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| or a whole house rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| We also fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| our community housing development organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| to fund new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and that could also include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| some affordable rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| And we have down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| to help renters become homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| You know, owning a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| is one of the best ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| for especially low-income people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| but really anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| to start to create wealth for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Once you have a certain amount of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| in your home, you can afford things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| like putting your child through college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| So we are committed to homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| but much more of our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| go towards affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| but we support both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Ms. Russ, before you move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| does the down payment assistance program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| does it work in tandem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| with KCDC's homeownership program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Yes, it actually does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Do you want to speak to that, Becky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Yes, the down payment assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| we've targeted that solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| to our community housing development agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| the CHODOs in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| We may be opening it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| to nonprofits going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| but one of our CHODOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| works very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| with KCDC's Section 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| to Homeownership Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And so they find a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| they rehab it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| they work with the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| to become a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| and then our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| can provide the down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| to get that family into that new home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| So just to go in a little more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| first of all, look up in the right-hand corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| You see the coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| CDBG is orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| HOME is blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| and ESG is green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| You're going to see these colors throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| because those are the sources of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| for each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| So for the owner-occupied rehab program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| it's a combination of CDBG and HOME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Emergency Home Repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| that's implemented by some agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| that work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| That's funded with CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Our CHODO funds come from HOME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| and then the down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| also comes from our HOME grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Our Rental Rehab Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| and this is different from the ARDF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| because this is a rehabilitation fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| that a landlord can access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| to bring their units up to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| and then commit to rent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| to lower-income citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And we do a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| for smaller landlords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| one house, a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| And then our project delivery costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| those are our housing staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| that work at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Before we go to the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| On the down payment assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| is there an education piece to that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Obviously, I think what I'm reading here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| is that you're helping somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| who's a first-time home buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| who doesn't have the down payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| to be able to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and so it looks like that's what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| But I'm wondering, oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| there's an education piece to that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| understanding everything that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| and is involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Just wondering if there's an education piece as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| The CHODOs that we work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| either they provide it themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| or they access those homeownership classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| from the Urban League or HomeSource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Both of those agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| do excellent training for homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Deputy Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Earlier, we talked about a lot of the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| coming through 211| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| and how they lead to affordable services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Is codes enforcement plugged into this funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I know a lot of times you get calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| from neighbors about a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| who has a hole in the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| In most of the cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| they can't afford to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| So does codes engage with your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| before they act on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| to make sure these funds can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| for those homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| We have programs that any citizen can apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| And we work very closely with codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| on our blighted property program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| So we get a lot of information from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| on really the serious problems in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| And we do have funds that are city-funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| for acquisition of blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| But as far as our housing programs go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| those individuals can apply for the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| either through our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| or with other agencies that do minor home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| that codes enforcement before they act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| engages your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| because there may be funds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| for those folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| I can't hear people wearing masks for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I just want to make sure that codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| has access to your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| during that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| to ensure that those folks can access these funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Obviously the people that are aware about this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| can call in, but a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| neighbors call on neighbors for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| And there's a reason that they can't repair it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| is because they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| And so I want to make sure that before codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| goes and starts a process of eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| that they have access to these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| through your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| We will contact your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| and we will make sure that they're fully aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| of all of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| So under economic opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Ms. Testerman, you asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| We're supporting three different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| One is for youth and young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| One is for adults and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| And then there's one for former offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| For homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| we are providing funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| for emergency shelter and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| And once again, that's a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| but that will be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| with the larger amount of COVID funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| for rapid rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| and then homelessness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| Under neighborhood stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| we have a small amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| that we use for blighted property stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Mostly that is for mowing the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| that the city owns that are for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| through the Homeacres program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| We provide design and technical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| to a nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| that provides that assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| to community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| nonprofit agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| as well as assistance in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| And then public facilities improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| we are doing one facility in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And then we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| a housing stabilization program with seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Then our administrative costs are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| and you can see that's at 6.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Director Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| back on the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| So will any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| the $375,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| will that be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| with any additional dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| So on the economic opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| and the $375,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| will those dollars be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| with any other dollars that we've received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| This is just in our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| in our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| So we're not combining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| these particular projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| with any other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| But these come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| through the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| So agencies apply for funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And so that's how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| we determine what agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| will receive funds in the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| based on the applications we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| So that's how you establish that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Can you refresh our memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| maybe last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| who received this category of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| and what they did with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| and that was for the youth and young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| And it was at around the $200,000 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| So we're increasing it this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Is that KLF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| or do you remember who received those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Yeah, it was KLF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| For Knox Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| For the Knox Works program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So under homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| these are the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| under general funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| we'll be funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| emergency shelter and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| and the UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| homeless management information system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| And here's our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| We're getting close to the end here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| We started our consultation meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| in August through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Our first public meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| We had consultation in January as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Our applications were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| to apply February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| We received those February 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| The draft plan was posted April 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| and we are still in the public comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| We had a consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| with homeless providers on the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| a public meeting on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| We're here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| April 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| for the city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And then this plan will come to you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| Next Tuesday for your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| And the plan's due to HUD May the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| I'll open it up for any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| If you have comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| if you could send them to Linda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| they will be included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| For the owner-occupied rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| are the numbers for that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| based on applications received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| So you already have a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| of the households you'll serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| We don't have a waiting list right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| so we're able to serve whoever applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| We hope to be able to do some outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| because we would like to get more applications in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| although it sort of ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| it was very difficult to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| because people didn't want workmen in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| So we really had to slow down a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Do you know what the budget allocation was for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| but it's very similar to this year, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| I can get it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| Council, do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Okay, if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I thank you, Director Wade and Ms. Russ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3499)|

| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| So now we are at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| and as with every City Council workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| we want to thank everyone who has come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| and who has signed up to speak to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| We would ask that you would refrain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| from personal attacks and profanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| in communicating with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| in the event that you do not honor that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| We will call you out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| and we'll go to the next public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| If you still don't comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| we will ask that you would please be seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| so the other speaker will be able to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Each person will have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| to speak to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3540)|

| 0:59:10| when you have about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| The first person we have up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| is Marie Essary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3553)|

| 0:59:30| My name is Marie Essary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| My address is 109 Barbary Drive, 37912,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| That was a lovely presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| and I would like to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| on how to allocate funds in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| So right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I'm a junior at Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| and I see in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| a lack of mental health resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Students are being forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| to go on with life as normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| and take testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| when really traumatic things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| are happening to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| so I would like to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| This is especially prominent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| in the Austinese community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| These students have laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| their lives on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| They feel so unprotected and vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| that they need to defend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| They also have to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| the reputation of their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| their peers, their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| and they're begging for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3627)|

| 1:00:35| burying their classmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| and being shoved into state testing rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| all at the exact same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| They're opening Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| oh, just thugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Those are adults who look to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| to tell them how to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| And right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| you're guiding in silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| and you're hiding away from the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| and they need you to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| So what you're showing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| is that their voice is not valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| that they don't deserve to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| and they don't deserve to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| You're also showing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| that trauma is inevitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| and they just have to close their eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| to heal from trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| To heal from trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| you need resources immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| way more immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| than you should take a state test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| that doesn't count for your class average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| They need support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3685)|

| 1:01:36| In the case of Anthony Thompson Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| before the shooting took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| we see him walking around the halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| you know, sitting on the stairwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| going in and out of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| walking past the front office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| and I wondered why has no one stopped him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| and said, Anthony, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| And then they're sitting in the security office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| talking about where is Anthony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| and this resource officer says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| oh, he hangs out in this bathroom every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Why is he in this bathroom every single day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Why has no one gone in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| and said, Anthony, what's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Why are you not in class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I love you, and I'm not here to punish you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I love you, I care about you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| and I want to protect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3735)|

| 1:02:19| If we're being honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| the reason this happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| is because we don't have the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Resource officers aren't therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Teachers are not therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3749)|

| 1:02:39| and able to notice students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| skipping classes and failing classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| We need professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| who aren't busy creating schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and checking our grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Students need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| that even if their home, their relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| their job, the streets, their teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| whatever is unsafe for them in that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| when they walk in the doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| they are safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| and until that need is met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Knox County and Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| will make no progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| in supporting their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| We are looking to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3789)|

| 1:03:19| to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| We need someone who can step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| We won't be silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| and we will speak our truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3807)|

| 1:03:43| Thank you, Mr. Ottone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3823)|
| 1:03:53| Carrie Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3833)|
| 1:04:04| Miss Hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| if you'd say your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| My address is 10058 McCormick Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| I grew up in West Knoxville where I was surrounded by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| who looked mostly like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| I was taught from a young age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| that police officers existed to protect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Living in West Knoxville, I didn't have much interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| with the police growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| This began to change when I started as a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| I made friends with people from different backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| and with different skin colors than my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I quickly learned that their experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| with the police had been much different than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| During college, I gained employment at a community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| that served mostly black youth in North and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Many of my students' parents were imprisoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| for minor crimes that I had seen white people easily get dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| My first personal experience with the police happened in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| when I was raped in the historic Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| which is KPD jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| Not long after the crime was committed, I went to KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| to file a police report and open an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| The detective who took my statement asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| if I was telling the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| because I could easily ruin a young man's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| with my accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| I began to cry as I realized the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| of what the detective was implying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| The detective then went on to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| that my tears were an indicator to him that I felt guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| for making up a story in an attempt to justify a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| that I had made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| He asked me to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| The man who raped me was never investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| or charged with a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=3959)|

| 1:07:44| Is it because the main voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| in our protest speaking out were black?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4066)|

| 1:13:16| Mr. Hayes, if you'd please give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4398)|

| 1:13:20| David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| Somebody said, let's make them uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Our presence makes them uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Having the people to their face makes them uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| So let's lean into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| So, there's so many things I could say right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| but it is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| The death of Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| is part of the failure of every single one of you up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| All of you have blood on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| Not only the death of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| the death of all five Austin East students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| who have been killed is on y'all's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Like the school board, like the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| like the mayor of Knoxville, like the mayor of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| like the criminal injustice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| How can I even say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Very easily, because they like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| we have two different issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| We got the cops killing us and we got us killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| We like to say those are two separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| but that's one issue that comes back to y'all's failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| How is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| We just sat here and listened to how they're spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| all this affordable housing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| This crumbs, they got this big old budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| and they're talking about, okay, look, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| we helped 80 people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| 80 people, we put a couple hundred units up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| A couple hundred units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| we got thousands of people needing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| We have crumbs going to actually ending people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| When we had all these young people in these schools killed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Gwen McKenzie, you, unapologetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| would come on the radio station, go around town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| being a, what did they call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| A mascot for the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Saying we need the police, police, police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Anytime we got issues in our community, what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| Police, police, police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| How do we handle public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Police, police, police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| $60 million, $60 million going to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| instead of going to the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| that could have saved our kids lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Now, when we talk about how the violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| from a police shooting and violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| for a community shooting is coming from the same place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I can say that because you all up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| refuse to put money into programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| that will save people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Y'all refuse to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I know so many brilliant people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| I'm sure a lot of y'all do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Brilliant people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| who work with young kids, get young kids off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Every single time I see something about violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| I wonder if that kid had access to the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| my friend Felusa Uti hosted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| maybe they would still be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| If they had the support to go to those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| maybe they would still be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Maybe they wouldn't have shot that gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| But because our city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| wants to put $60 million into policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| and not into the programs we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| we're dealing with these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| All of you are blood on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| There's no way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| Now, now the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| they was like, we're gonna do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| We're gonna put a little bit of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| in violence intervention and prevention, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| SEMA worked on a great resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| And they was only asking for crumbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| just a couple million dollars, but it was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Guess what Tommy Smith and the rest of these people did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| They said, no, you're not gonna add any money to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| We're just gonna give a little light nod to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| but we're actually not gonna make the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| in our communities and save people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| The death of Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4585)|

| 1:16:31| is due to the inaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| and oppressive white supremacist action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| of this body right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4596)|

| 1:17:17| I got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4637)|
| 1:17:17| Oh, of course you want that moment of silence, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Think it's her first, her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| No, it's for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| We'll do it for a minute right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| For one minute, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| One minute, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Start on our time, we say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| Laughing monsters ain't funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Nothing's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| You a black man, disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4653)|
| 1:17:51| We were back at we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4683)|

| 1:18:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| It is unfortunate that somebody had to come up and give a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| of silence in public forum and y'all would not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| This is why we are getting y'all out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Thank you Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Summer Awad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| And for those who were not here at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4711)|
| 1:18:42| there was a moment of silence and the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| of our students were called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Mr. Awad, if you please give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| and address please for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Hi, my name is Summer Awad, 1212 Wallingford Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| I want to talk today about the consequences of not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| This community, East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| in particular has been asking for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| and many decades as Daysha Lundy said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| in the county commission meeting on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| for 41 years her community has been disinvested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| And that is why a lot of us have decided to get more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| in politics and take matters into our own hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| so that we can elect leaders that will listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| But as we can see in our budgets, in the police budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| after we beg and beg, don't put more money towards police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| put more money toward what really is public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| you all continue to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| in the same things over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| As we ask for more affordable housing, it continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| to be mixed income housing and gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| We ask for more resources into our communities and you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| decide to focus your attention on a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| And not listening has consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| It has very real consequences, bodies in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| I work in East Knoxville and I was driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| between two client appointments the other day and was stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| in my tracks when I saw the hearse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| and the funeral procession carrying Anthony Thompson Jr.'s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| body and that was just a real sobering moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| and that is something that I would not have to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| in my home in West Knoxville where I grew up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| and that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| that could have been prevented were we listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| And Anthony's death could have been prevented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| if he were listened to when he said, my bad, my bad, wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| So there are consequences to not listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| and this movement has been protesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| since Anthony Thompson Jr.'s death about every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and we will continue to do so and we will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| to build political power and vote you all out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| because there are consequences to not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| And I want to talk in particular about a couple of elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| and appointed officials that I'm extremely disappointed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| You know, back in the mayoral election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| I voted for Reverend Calvin Taylor Skinner in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| because he was the person who represented my values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| but we're always given a lot of bad choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| and so sometimes we have to make pragmatic choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and so in the end, I decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| since Mayor Kincannon was branding herself as a liberal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| maybe I would go ahead and try to give her my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| because, you know, maybe that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| the most likely outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I regret that every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Mayor Kincannon's legacy is evicting houseless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| from their encampments against CDC recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| during the middle of a global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Her legacy is riding in a police tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| towards the beginning of her tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Her legacy is announcing that she thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| that the DA's decision to not press charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| against the cops was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| Who is she to say that it's fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Who asked her to comment on it at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| unless it was to demand justice and to demand accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| for the police department that is under her purview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| And I saw some videotape from Chief Eve Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| the other night at the disparities in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| educational outcomes meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Some community members asked her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| can you comment on your use of force policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| and your de-escalation policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| She said, I cannot comment on those policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| because you all will twist them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| to fit the Anthony Thompson Jr. situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| I'm sorry, your policies are your policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| You can't discuss your policies with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| because you think that they will fit them to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| and expose your wrongdoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| and the wrongdoing of your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| This is an appointed official by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| And this is absolutely ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Sometimes I ask myself often if Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| and Chief Thomas and DH Harmon Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| are these people hateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| or are they just purely incompetent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And I ask the same about a lot of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And I'm tired of having to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| are our leaders hateful or are they incompetent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| or are they both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| And we are going to continue to fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| and we're gonna continue to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| until we have people that listen to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| because the consequences of not listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| sound like Anthony Thompson Jr. in a grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| And the consequences of not listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| sound like more black bodies in graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| And so I want us to remember Anthony Thompson Jr. today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| and at all other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Please say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you, Ms. Awad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5036)|

| 1:24:10| If you'd give us your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| Hello, my name is Jen McMahon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| and I'm located at 3401 Fountain Park Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| I moved to Knoxville six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| I was an AmeriCorps VISTA serving at Compassion Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| From there, I moved on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| and I became the Homeless Management Information System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Data Coordinator for the Tennessee Valley Continuum of Care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| During that time, I went around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| to our rural East Tennessee regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| and trained people on how to collect data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| how to collect stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| so we could submit that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| to ensure that HUD and our local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| state governments and federal governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| properly allocated funds to address the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| that are directly happening within our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| And during that time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| not only did I serve as the HMIS Coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| but I was also part of the Supportive Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| for Veteran Families Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| the Emergency Service Grant, Case Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| and I also was a part of the PIT count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| for the last, I would say, five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| And all during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| we've collected all of these data and all of these stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| all of these voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| and they're continuing to be silenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| We have hard data right in front of us about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| We have hard data in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| about where our communities do not have support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| and do not have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| And in addition to that, we have voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| We have people standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| and taking their time away from their kiddos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| or with their kiddos or taking time after work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| or anything to be able to express their voice to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| And what I have seen over the last six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| that I've lived in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| is continual silence of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| who do not look like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| When I came in here to put my name down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I did not look threatening because I'm a white woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| I came here to be a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| If you don't listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| there are going to be more voices like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| We're going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| We're going to continue to show the hard data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| but we're gonna continue to raise up the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| of the people within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| I'm sick and tired as a service provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| having to scramble for crumbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| to serve the individuals that I work with every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I work with folks in Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Rhone, Monroe, Meigs, Blount, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| And all these individuals that are exiting incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| have so limited amount of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| We are literally sending them back into incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| because we do not have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We do not have childcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| And we have a police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| that is actively looking to put folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| back into incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| to continue to support our prison industrial complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| I'm here today asking that you listen to the voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210429?start=5240)|
