| 0:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| Do you know my brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| My brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| Observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| I'll give him a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=28)|
| 0:00:44| I'm making sure she's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=44)|
| 0:00:58| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| I'd like to welcome everyone to the last council meeting of 2009 and call the meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| We'll begin by asking Mr. Woodhull to lead us in invocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| and then we'll ask Mr. Della Volpe to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| If we could stand and bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| We come to this gathering with humility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| and with gratitude for the many blessings of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| the blessings of family, the blessings of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| that this country affords to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| We're grateful for also the opportunity to gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| and to seek a higher wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| that is only yours, that is achieved through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| our conversation and our sharing, our deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| and our decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| We pray that this would be a fruitful meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| for the community of Knoxville. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you. If you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| Councilman Bailey. Here. Vice Mayor Becker. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Councilman Brown. Present. Councilman Della Volpe. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=152)|

| 0:02:40| Councilman Pavlis. Here. Councilman Roddy. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| Councilman Woodhull. Here. Is there a motion to approve our minutes of the meeting of December 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| So moved. Second. Any discussion, corrections, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Opposed, no. Motion carries. Any items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Postponed? Added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| The consent items are 11P as in Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| through 11V as in Victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Any discussion on any of those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| All those in favor, aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| Okay. A couple of things real quick on Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| First of all, I think everybody knows the first night in Knoxville is a New Year's Eve celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| of the arts that we have in downtown Knoxville. It's very family friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| It's alcohol free out on Market Square. It's produced by the nonprofit Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| District Association. And the last couple of years we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| thousands of people literally come down. It's another one of the great nights downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| I want to encourage everyone listening as well as everyone here to come and enjoy and be a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| of the great crowd that I'm sure we're going to have on Thursday, even though I think it's going to be a little chilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| But hopefully everybody will be okay on that. Secondly, I'd like to ask, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| Mr. Gregory Chambers is here. And Mr. Chambers, if you'd come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| to the podium, we would really appreciate that. While he's walking, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| give you a little background on why we asked him to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| And I'll ask Chief Sharp to walk down. On November 29th, a fire broke out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| in Knob Hill Apartments Unit that was occupied by two elderly brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Greg Chambers, who works over at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Juvenile Service Center, the Richard Bean Juvenile Service Center, lived upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| saw flame and smoke, and knew that the two older gentlemen were inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| He entered the unit, calling out for the two men. He crawled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| under the smoke with his shirt over his mouth and nose, I guess improvising a breathing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| system there, until he found one and was able to pull him to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| He went back in the apartment and found another man, Wesley Pasch, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| could not be here with us tonight, pulling the other brother to safety. These actions took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| place before the fire department arrived, and they arrived soon after that, and probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| saved the lives of those two men. So, on behalf of the city of Knox, I'd like to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| these certificates of recognition. This certificate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| Mr. Chambers for risking his own life to save his neighbors and let you know that we are very grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| for your bravery. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you very much. And that is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| for Mayor's Report. Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Mr. Whithall. Thank you, Mayor. I wanted to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| a young man, Arthur Lawson, who is sitting behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Arthur is a sophomore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| at Austin East High, a great writer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| very interested in public service. His mother is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| right up there watching television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Your mother's watching. Arthur also is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| accomplished violinist, and he just wanted to sit up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| I hope it's okay with everybody that he's sitting behind me, so he can just watch this proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Perfect. Glad to have you. Welcome, Arthur, and thank you, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Councilman Grief. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| I'm not sure whether this is the appropriate time, but I'll go ahead anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| First of all, on behalf of the new council folks, we definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| want to thank Cindy and Mickey and Melissa and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Susan for the outstanding swearing-in ceremony. I thought it was very special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| and one that we'll definitely remember, so I'd like to go on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| in terms of thanking them for that. Also, wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| just throw out the idea maybe to Vice Mayor Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| that with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| coming up soon and this sort of thing, that is it possible that we as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| council maybe can have several meetings to get together and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| the future of Knoxville and vision of what we think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| might be, especially before the budget comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| I know that I think with the Sunshine Law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| we have to be careful in terms of what we do in terms of talking to each other, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| I think if there's a possibility that we could do something like that, I know it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| a great benefit to me, so I'd like to throw that out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| Go ahead, Vice Mayor. Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| I want to echo Councilman Grief's thoughts, the thanks about how well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| the inauguration came off. Our Master of Ceremonies did a nice job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| despite him usually not being a good speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| I guess there are a couple thoughts I have on where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| go next as a council on learning things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| I was going to wait until the next council meeting when we have a council dinner to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| about more of these things in depth. It still feels to me like it's the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| I got up this morning in Richmond, so I have some highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| in my brain. We need to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| some of the shared leadership stuff, the idea that there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| positions that we have to fill as council, who's going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| who's going to sit in which seat that we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| We need to talk about some continuing learning on some of the things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| codes enforcement. I know there's been a lot of interest from the new members on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| We can talk some about visioning for the future. The other option we've got on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| the budgeting and the visioning works is we generally do a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| retreat every year. I generally think those are in early February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| and I don't know if we have any ideas for dates yet, Mr. Martin. I think we have it scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| for February 2nd. February 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| One of the discussions that I had with Deputy Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Martin was the idea of putting some time in there to do some learning about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| process. I guess what I heard you say that was new was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| a little more of the visioning stuff. I'd like to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| at the next dinner about how we get some of that done and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| that works. That's what I'm thinking on that. If I could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| editorialize, I think it would be great to maybe have, you might wait until after that mid-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| budget review because we're going to work hard to make that a very intensive learning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| which might facilitate the discussion after that. That's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| an opinion. Obviously, you all can do that however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Of course, our dinner does provide a forum for doing at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| the beginning of that. I think what Duane is talking about is a terrific idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| The next dinner we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| chat about what it is we mean by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| By all that. By shared leadership and some of the visioning, some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| learning. That's really ongoing. That's January 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| or 11th, something like that? It'll be the year-all's dinner will be the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just wanted to tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| neighborhood leaders in the 4th District, we're going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| meeting on Thursday night, January 7th from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| 7 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. at the Northside Christian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| That's at 4008 Townsville Pike. We're going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| have a series of these meetings over the next year or so to get folks together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| to bring their ideas of what are pressing issues in their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| what are opportunities that might be realized, and kind of get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| neighborhoods talking to each other and through the 4th District Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| seat. So, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Seeing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| further lights, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| 8A, a resolution confirming the reappointment of Bobbie Christenberry to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Knoxville Solicitations Board. Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=632)|

| 0:12:08| be recognized. Thank you. Thank you for coming, Brenda. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Okay. Move to approve. I'd like to move to approve. Okay. I'll take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=732)|

| 0:13:00| Might I inquire? I understand from the papers we received that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| essentially we're going back to the original ordinance that we had before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| amendment took place a year ago. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| That is correct. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Discussion? Okay. All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| 11A, a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| issuing a certificate of compliance to T&T Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| doing business as Ash Wines and Spirits relative to its application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission to renew its license to operate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| liquor store in the city. Move approval. Second. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| I hate to do this again, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| I raised a question earlier in the week, and I think I have the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| but I'm concerned that we don't check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| on these businesses to see if they've paid their city taxes and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| fees they owe us. We apparently checked that they've paid their business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| I am told that we're following an ordinance that requires us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| look at specific items, but it strikes me as an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| have some heart-to-heart discussions with owners of businesses if there is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| not this particular one, but if there is one that is in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| I recommend we take a look at some way of doing that, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| at least including that in the information packet so we know if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| carrying their end of the citizens' load of paying their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Actually, the certificate of compliance is regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| by state law, and it only requires certain information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| and the approval of the certificate is not in any way tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| to their payment of taxes. And that's for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| state law. I understand, but we're not just a rubber stamp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| and we should have a little opportunity for moral suasion if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| an owner that's applying to us and hasn't carried their duty as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| to pay their taxes. Everyone else is expected to pay theirs, and I think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| find a way to at least include that information in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you. And just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| there's not a situation with this particular...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| There's nothing with 11A, and I don't mean to... You're just bringing it up in general, right? Yeah, there's three of these on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Right. Vice Mayor. You know, I actually think Mr. Della Vope has an interesting idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Again, while we can't actually refuse to give them their certificate because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| they haven't paid the taxes, it would give us an opportunity to follow up and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| they're done. And I guess I wanted to ask Mr. Martin if you could just check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| and see if there is a way with these to do a check for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| in the future and just let us know if there is a retailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| that's behind on something to the city. It's a chance for that councilman to call and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| I want to help you. You need to get this paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you. Will do. Thank you. So noted. Okay. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| I don't think we voted yet. All those in favor, aye? Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Motion carries. 11B, a resolution issuing a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| of compliance to Core Inc. doing business as Cedar Bluff Discount Wines and Spirits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| to renew its license to operate a liquor store in the city. Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Second. Questions here? All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| 11C, a resolution issuing a certificate of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| to Vick's Package Store relative to its application to the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Alcoholic Beverage Commission to renew its license to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Mr. Del Valle. This is one of the three that triggered my initial response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I called the city tax department today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I don't believe the Vick's Package Store is the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| I couldn't establish that. There's a GNR development that owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| also on 108 Stacoya Lane. They owe the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| two years' delinquent taxes. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| it's about $20,000. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| I wish we had some way of following up on this and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| to the owners about that. That's apparently a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| new shopping center area off Clinton Highway and a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| prosperous area and they should be carrying their part of the city tax burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| So no, we will follow up. Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| What I heard our law director say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| making a decision about that really is not connected to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| I mean, at what point, and it's clearly a decision we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| need to think about, do we want to use this venue to embarrass people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| What else are we going to measure? Whether they've gone to church and are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| spending time with their children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| So I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| comments, but that's a direction I personally wouldn't want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Any other comments? Okay. Ready to vote then? All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Opposed, no. Motion carries. I just want to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| as a follow-up. On the beer board, we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| get a chance to look at the taxes and I guess some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| council members take it upon themselves to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| or point out that they're behind in their taxes, but that's about all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| I'm sort of like Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| I don't think it's a bad idea to put it in the packet if somebody wants to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| it in the packet, but beyond that, what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| right here has nothing to do with the taxes. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| along the lines with Councilman Woodhull. Any council member can do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| they want to do, but I'll be looking at what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Okay. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1132)|

| 0:20:44| $495,859.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Yes, Mr. Mayor. I just was hoping maybe Larry Martin or someone could explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| to us what it is we're buying. We're paying about a half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| thereabouts in a premium to avoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| I gather, risk over a certain dollar amount, that dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| being the $15.8 million. And I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| because the information in the table, I'm not sure I understood it exactly, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| it seemed to indicate that we had seven claims over a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| that was about $422,000 in 2009 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| would have come over some limit. But I may not be reading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| correctly, so I'm trying to understand what are we buying? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Council Member Della Voppe, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| It is to cap our exposure. And it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| if you look at it, there are two pieces to this. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| stop loss is for individual claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And so if we have under the, and by the way, this is a renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| of Beacon. They have carried this insurance for us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Is that the $150,000? Well, moving to $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| So if in a given year, then we have the claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| that exceed the $175,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| then those dollars over the $175,000 are paid by Beacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| The other part of this, so that's part number one, that's what is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| specific stop loss, which is by an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| The second is in regard to aggregate. And what that is, they take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| an estimation of our claims that I think have, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| been incurred over the last 36 months to be paid over the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| They take 125% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| So that places our aggregate cap at the $15.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| So any dollar over the $15.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| is covered under the insurance up to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| maximum of $2 million. So in simple terms, you're buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| a policy for that portion of the coverage at the $2 million level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| And did I understand you correctly to say that if I look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| 2010 expected claims, there's about a $12.2 million number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| and you take 125% of that? That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And if you'll look in the comparison of those, Beacon was the lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| number there. They had the lower forecast of what those would be, which made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| our hurdle, our tipping point, to be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| So we're capping our exposure, at least up to $2 million. Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| In the case of aggregate and then in the case of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| over $175. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| Any other questions? Okay. All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1412)|

| 0:24:52| Excuse me. Go ahead. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Those properties, where are they exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| The map that you will be constructing. The first four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| are at the corner of Chestnut and Louise, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Is that right? Right. The corner of Chestnut and Louise are where the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| four duplexes are. I don't believe all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| locations have been selected yet. Let me verify that with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| They have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| He says they do have the other locations. Would you like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| where those are now? No. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1528)|

| 0:25:58| in Empowerment Zone funding for the Vestal Commercial Redevelopment Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| and to extend the term of the contract to June 30, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| Are you going to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Yeah, go ahead. This is a continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| This $500,000 will be added to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| $500,000 that's been allocated to the Vestal Redevelopment Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| This is part of our Empowerment Zone Program and the improvements that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| targeted for some time for downtown Vestal. This additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| $500,000 will allow us to continue our work. We've already acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| through KCDC, who manages this project for us, we've already acquired the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| two commercial properties at the corner of Martin Mill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Ogle. Those have been demolished and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| prepping the site for future commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| and will soon go out for an RFP for commercial development on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| In order to allow for commercial development, we need parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| and so part of these dollars will go towards purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| an adjacent lot or a lot a couple doors down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| and a parking lot will be developed there. There is a list of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| public improvements that have been recommended and we're in the process of reviewing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| to figure out exactly what we can accomplish with the money we have and the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| months that we have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Do I get $600,000 every meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| We're just starting with District 1. It's going to go to 2 next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Going back to the Legacy Park, the $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| will get us closer to that goal there and it just happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| to lie in the 1st District. That combined with this and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| other activity, this is a great stimulus for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| an area that can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| this help along with the whole 1st District and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| as well. When you look at what's happened downtown and then out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Central Avenue now, 4th and Gill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| we've got a Magnolia Corridor, all the tentacles are starting to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| out and I think that it's a fantastic thing to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| our city grow from within out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| This is just another step in that direction and I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| very appreciative that it's in the 1st District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and the Vestal area and I'm sure that those dollars will be well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| spent and get some activity going there and get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| really good things going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| in South Knoxville. So I'm just very appreciative of that. I would also add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| we just found out that the lot further west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| from the church has been purchased. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| a warehouse, 6,000 square feet of warehouse and office space and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| new business is moving in there, a green business actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| promoting solar PV installations. So we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| very excited about new businesses being attracted to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Great. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I want to ask you a question about the Empowerment Zone funding. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| drying up, so to speak, and roughly how much will be left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| in that funding? Can you tell me that or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| something that's hard to say at this point? Well, we are anticipating spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| every penny. That is our goal. All of the money has been allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| The $25.6 million, all of it has been allocated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| different projects and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| so we are working hard on both the programs that we implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| those that KCDC is involved in and some of our other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| We assess on a weekly basis where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| and it is possible that as we move on the last six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| months, which all of this money has to be spent in the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| we may, the P&I Board, which is the Partnership for Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Improvement Board of Directors, has the authority to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| how the funds are spent. And so if we see that some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| say, for example, if all the money won't be used in the loan program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| and there's a need for it in the facade program, then we will move it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So it is our goal to spend every penny and we're on track to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| that. So we're working hard to make that happen. How much is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| all told? The total is $25.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| But I mean, what's left to spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| There's about $5 million left to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| but some of these are big commercial development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| You know, we have been affected by the economy in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| where some projects were slower to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| more difficult. You know, we try to leverage the private sector funding, so we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| had the situation where some of the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| entrepreneurs have had to come up with the private dollars, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| been slowed some. In addition, we had a couple of facades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| that were ready to go, but then again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| the owner couldn't get the private sector dollars. So that has slowed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| some of our ability to spend the money. But as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| we are working on it every day, we and our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| and with the goal to spend every penny. Is it public yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| the business that's moving in there, or is it still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| too early? Well, he's purchased the property, so I assume I can say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Sustainable Futures, which is one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| well, there may be more, one of two that I'm aware of, of solar PV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| installation companies that they were in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and they chose to move to downtown Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| So we're real excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Just one clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Ms. Rojero, is spent committed in a contract or fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| used up, so to speak? When you said you had a June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| deadline, was it a contract commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| or an actual completion? The expenses have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| been incurred by June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| You know, we can pay it out in July, we can reimburse. All of these are reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| So the expense has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| be incurred by June 30th of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| 2010. Would you be amenable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| meet with the council some afternoon that we're getting together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| tell us about the remaining projects? I would love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| That would be great. Okay, any other questions? Okay, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=1962)|

| 0:34:46| per year for monitoring and verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| services and $44,523 per year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| maintenance services. Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| I apologize. I was reading this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and it's a fairly extensive work of art here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| There were a few points that I was curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| that we might and I don't know if we have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| We have several folks here. I'm going to ask them to come down so they can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Boyce Evans who's a purchasing agent for the city who's here and can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Jack Bosch who's the vice president of Amerisco is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| So I might ask you all both to move toward the podium just so you can answer any specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Go ahead. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| I am somewhat familiar with the energy audit and the things we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| to find a way to save money and I think that's a great thing in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| that we use less energy and we use energy more wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| Overall, I'm very much in favor of this. I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| item, I want to say it's section 1G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| excuse me, 1F and it has to do with maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and monitoring and I wonder if it's acceptable if we added a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| sentence to that paragraph on maintenance that basically recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| that the city is the entity with the obligation for maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| under this contract and, in fact, there are termination issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| result from improper maintenance or adjustments to fees. If we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| put a provision in there that says the city shall be allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| appropriate maintenance staff accompany and observe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Amerisco engineers on their inspection and verification efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| here under, the here under being this paragraph 1F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| It provides for a certain number of days of maintenance and inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| work by Amerisco and I think that the learning curve for our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| would be important since they have the burden of carrying out the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| part to meet the guarantees so maybe we could put some language in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| to that effect if that's not objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Mr. Bossier or Boyce, either one of you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| First off, we do plan to accompany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Amerisco during the measurement and verification every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| that they do that. As far as putting language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| into the contract for that, really that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| I'd have to work that with the law department. I mean, nothing's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| fully executed yet so that wouldn't require amendment and I don't know why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| you guys are fine with that, are you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| To your point, sir, as far as training goes, the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| does provide for training of city employees on the measures that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| implemented at the beginning as well as provide training over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| on an as needed basis. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| city staff to accompany us, we would welcome that. No problems with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| whatsoever. Thank you. There's a corresponding provision, section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| 10F and it's on page 12 and it talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| about the adjustment to the baseline and if I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| this correctly, and I may not, but if I understand it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| this deals with the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| potential situation where they don't maintain up to whatever those international| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| performance measurement and verification standards are, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| might end up in an adjustment to the amount of credit or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| guaranteed amounts that we're to receive under this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| because the contract is set up so that hopefully it pays for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| that the energy savings pay for the cost of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| installation and supervision. I wonder if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| couldn't add something to the end of that paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| that simply recognizes the cooperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| nature of the effort so that we don't miss the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| requirements and baseline and it would state something to the effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| of, and I'm not wedded to the words, Amoresco shall promptly notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| the city of any such contention, the contention in the text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| being that we haven't properly operated, maintained, or repaired, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| cooperate with the city to outline a cure so that the full benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| of the contract can be realized by the city. And again, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| kind of a tail on that discussion that says we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| work together to try to work out the maintenance issues rather than simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| trigger some notion of default or issue with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Bottom line, that's a very logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| statement thought to reduce to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| writing and absolutely we can do that. And it's partly my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| anal training, I think, as a lawyer, but we always wonder what happens when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| things go bad. People pull out the paper and start reading it and that's when you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| to have that balance in there. Understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I think there was one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| I guess this is more of a question and you guys can explain this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| rather than a comment. On Section 3B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| this is the place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| if for some reason we don't meet the savings because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| costs have increased or something has happened, interest rates have gone up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| there have been changes in the foreseeable 13-year effort we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| undertaking here, that there can be some adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| either to the guaranteed savings and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| a termination by one party or the other of the agreement. And I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| curious as to what is at risk. It's obvious that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| the cost incurred by Amoresco to the point of a termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| if it were the city or vice versa, I guess, would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| But I don't understand. Are we on tap for the full $19 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| loan? Will it be paid out over time? Are we only drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| on the parts we install? What happens to this $19 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| which is a debt the city will incur, hopefully to be repaid by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| the guarantee? What happens if we run into this unanticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| situation? If I may speak to that, I don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| actual contract in front of me. I believe the section that you're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| 3B, relates to changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| in interest rates right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| frankly, at this point in time, as opposed to over time. Well, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| includes other events, circumstances, or developments which are outside the control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| of Amoresco which cause or have effect of causing the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| energy cost savings to be less than the guaranteed savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| Something happens and we're getting something less than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| all hoped for and are working towards. Again, I don't have the contract in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| of me. I believe that section relates to events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| that might occur. It contemplates a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| delay between signing the contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| Amoresco and then signing a financing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| There is no time delay here. You're going to do that tomorrow or the next day? I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| that only addresses a situation that could arise during that. So you think that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| an interim thing? Okay. I didn't have the attachment E, so I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| answer that. Give me one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| And the general nature of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| question is how much are we on the hook for if one of these things gets realized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| This would only affect if there were a time lag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| between executing the performance contract and executing a finance document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| So it's almost moot at this point? It is moot at this stage if everything moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| as anticipated. In this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| you would not fund. If that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| arose, the only liability to the city at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| would be for the audit fee if you chose not to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| But in this case, it's a moot point. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| And I guess the final thought or question I have relates to Section 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| which is the term of the agreement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| it has some language which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| is appropriate in context, but I'm not sure it's spelled out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| a way I understand it. At the very end of that paragraph, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2586)|
| 0:43:20| It's looking at a situation where, for some reason, the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| ends up being cut off. I suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| that triggers in my mind a question of what is when due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| and are there situations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| there's a termination? And again, I don't want to anticipate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| worst. I want to anticipate the best out of this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| I would like to see some kind of a tail on the end of that sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| that would put a comma after termination that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| for repairs, improper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| installation. In other words, something that recognizes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| you would pay the amounts due Amoresco subject to adjustment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| shortfalls on Amoresco's part. I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| should be much of a debating point, but the language doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| sing out to me and make that clear to me. So it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| at the tail end of Section 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| And like I said, it would be something like subject only to any legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| city offsets for repairs, improper installation, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Kind of language that caused you to fail to meet the guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Sir, I think Section 14, the termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| clause in there really does what we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| And in essence, I guess the main thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| in our termination clause from a financial standpoint is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| in other words, all we would end up having to pay Amoresco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| if we terminated is really the work that they've done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| date, not any future work that they may have done or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| profits or anything like that they may be entitled to. It stops with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| where they are on the date that we terminate. In essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| that's what the. Right. Right. And I understand that. It's kind of like a termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| for convenience. You pay for the work done, but not any future guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| My question is under 5, just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| clarification, it would be subject to any legitimate offsets the city has for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| improper performance by Amoresco at the time of the termination by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| In other words, and I'm just asking for a clarification. I don't know how important that is, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| it makes me feel warm and fuzzy to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| From my perspective, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| Perfectly agreeable. My final question, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| is on the maintenance part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Am I reading the right thing? Maybe I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| There's an annual fee of about $86,000, right, for the inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| and maintenance and the verification process. Is that an escalatable cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| or is that? It is. It escalates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| with the CPI, consumer price index, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| cannot exceed, no matter what the CPI does, it cannot exceed 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| per year. Okay, so it's capped at 3%. That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Yes, I think it's a good program. In the long term, it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| save the city some money, but I want to ask you on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| 6, number 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| about minority and women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| subcontracting out and are you using any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| minority-owned or African-American-owned businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Excuse me. At this point, we have not executed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| any subcontracts since there is no company. It's too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Yes, exactly, but yes, we will be using. I don't know a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| percentage, per se, if you will, but our normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| process as a company, we strongly promote the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| advancement of the minority business community, minority and women-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| business. We usually have targets within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| own programs of 15% to 20% unless a customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| directs us with specific goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| Here, our goal would be to find women and minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| subcontractors to attempt to get at least to that type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| of a percentage participation. I don't have specific subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| that I can cite to you now. We have not executed any contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| but we typically look for minority contractors, women-owned contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| but we also have to ensure that these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| very high-quality contractors, as we do with any contractor, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| the program is based on best value to be delivered to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| Well, I would strongly urge you to do so and hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| that is done because we want to have a level playing field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| especially and particularly with African-American businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| because it's a $20 million project, and I'm hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| that there will be some African-American businesses included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| in this contract as we move along. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Typically, what we would do, actually, we would hold kind of a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| to brief the local contractor community on the particular aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| of the program, invite anyone who is interested, any local contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| to attend those, those that are interested, submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| kind of qualifications to us, and we work to bring them into the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| as much as possible. Local contractors obviously get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| highest priority. We like to keep the dollars in the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| And, sir, I'm looking here at one of the documents that Amoresco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| provided me with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| because I know the city's goal is 10% of our business with minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| and women-owned firms, so I asked them, okay, kind of who are you looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| earlier that could fit into that, and I'm counting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| it up here. Potentially, again, no contract's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| let yet. It's all dependent on you all approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| what we're here for, but there's a women-owned business for some of the controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| they were looking at, another woman-owned business as a general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| There's quite a few small businesses here. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Native American-owned, woman-owned business for lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| There's actually quite a few of them, and I would like to say that I believe it's 95%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| greater than 95% of the installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| of the energy conservation measures are being looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| at potentially for firms within the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| But noted on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| African-American community, and again, no contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| has been let yet. These are just potentials at this point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| appreciate the comment, and I'm the one that has to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you. I am very much for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| program, and, Boyce, I appreciate you spending about an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| answering all my questions, so thank you, but there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| one question I asked you that I did want to ask the gentleman with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Ameresco. Thirteen years is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| long time to have a partnership, and 13 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| in green technology terms is a lifetime. Are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| going to be able to stay current with new technologies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| That is one of the obligations that we take on ourselves is to help keep you current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| as far as new technologies emerge. We will evaluate those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| if you will, on your behalf. Not only the equipment, but also the practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Exactly. We look at all of that. Obviously, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| our business. We will provide briefings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091229?start=3064)|
