| 0:01:14| Pledge Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| To the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=87)|
| 0:01:35| Okay, before we jump into tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| I'd like for some of our guests who may be watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| and some folks who this may be your first time attending a county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| I want to let you know kind of how it works in terms of the meetings and how agendas are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| The Knox County Commission meets, has two formal meetings each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| The first meeting is the meeting that we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| This is considered a work session meeting where we will be taking a first pass through the agenda for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=118)|
| 0:02:06| Prior to this meeting, I posted on a public board, so to speak, a suggested consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=126)|
| 0:02:14| and tonight we will go through and basically take a few items that need to be debated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| We'll debate, probably vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Some items will be carried forward to next week to be debated and voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| but ultimately I want you to know that one of the main purposes that we have in tonight's meeting at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| is to formulate and set the actual formal agenda where at the meeting next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=153)|
| 0:02:42| the votes will count, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| So tonight is the more informal agenda setting, first pass through the agenda for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| Next week will be the more formal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| You'll also see next week the clerk's office, once we've built our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| they'll read all of those items into the record and then we'll have one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| So the simple items, the non-controversial items, they all get put into one motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| and they're taken care of at one stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| So I hope that helps clarify and explain everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| All right, the first item on our agenda, and we didn't have anybody sign up for this in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| but we do have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Is there anyone who would like to speak at public forum this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| My glasses have been fogging, so you all may see me taking them on and off a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| All right, okay, seeing none, we'll move on to, we're now at the part of our agenda where we set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| I'm going to review what I've got based on what was posted in the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| and what any of you all may have responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| But tonight we have two items that need to be officially added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Those are items 31 and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| The items that will be withdrawn are items 28 and 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=243)|
| 0:04:14| Before I go to the non-consent ones, I'll go to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I'd like to request that item 64 be heard at the commission meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| That was the discussion item around the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| So we will, Kim, if you could make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| Seeing now, the non-consent items are items 6, 25, 27, 35, 37, 46, 55, 58, 59, 60, 61,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=277)|
| 0:05:06| 62, 64, and 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| Those are all the non-consent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| And as Commissioner Beeler mentioned, discussion item number 64 will be taken care of at next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=315)|
| 0:05:25| Are there any other items that you'd like to see pulled from consent or any other suggested changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Two changes that we'll be making in terms of order of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| We will hear out of respect to our dear friend, Sherry, our county clerk, whose team keeps this ship moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=336)|
| 0:05:48| Sherry has an item before us that is actually item 59 that is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| So I know you've got an obligation to get to, so I will be moving that item to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| Also, just as an early heads up, item number 71, which is in the zoning, that was the item that we need to cure from last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=361)|
| 0:06:11| It's currently listed as the last item on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| We're going to move that for next week up to the first item that will be considered when we go into zoning at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=375)|
| 0:06:25| So, yes, Mr. Daly, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Out of courtesy, could we move number 55, Charlie's, behind Sherry's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| So they can go home and eat supper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Yeah, any of these clerks, you know, they've always got plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| So, yeah, we'll move that one up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| I don't know if you all noticed, but when I posted to the forum, I did some sort of weird spell correct, and I posted Charlie as Clark Susano instead of Clerk Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=405)|
| 0:06:55| I think I always type those up in Word and then post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| I think Word corrected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| So, Clark, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| So we'll hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| That's a good suggestion, Commissioner Daly, and we'll hear those first two right out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Are there any recommendations or any other suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Could I have a motion to set tonight's agenda, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=431)|

| 0:07:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=454)|

| 0:07:44| A motion from Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=464)|

| 0:08:07| This is a resolution to honor Dr. Peter Tsai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| I'm going to pronounce his last name probably incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| But before we get a motion on this one, because we'll probably need to send it forward to be approved next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| Commissioner Jay, you brought that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Do you want to weigh in on this and tell us a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| In case some of us may have been following his story in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I'm going to call on you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| I'm pleased to offer an honorary resolution supporting Dr. Peter Tsai,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=512)|

| 0:08:59| His greatest work started right here at the University of Tennessee through the Research Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| And Dr. Tsai had actually retired several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| And then when the global pandemic came about towards the end of last calendar year, beginning of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| he started getting calls from all over the world and has now sort of come out of retirement to help people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| including Oak Ridge National Lab, find ways for sterilization techniques and reuse techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| and really reinvented his work in the material sciences world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=569)|

| 0:09:43| There's a few links to the other articles that have been picked up by Wall Street Journal, CNN, and other health, I guess, across the globe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=583)|

| 0:10:01| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=601)|

| 0:10:15| I mean, I figured everybody would be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| So Commissioner Jay, we'll have all the commissioners come on as sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Thanks for bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| And if you saw the forum, there's a couple of links I pulled just on his story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| So have you got that noted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| I'll add just one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=629)|

| 0:10:41| And he's a very humble person who wants no recognition but is the perfect person to honor with such a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So we just discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| So the proper motion would be to send forward with no recommendation from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| So all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| I think it's at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| The next item is listed on page 59, item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| It's on page 11, item 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| It's Ordinance O-20-7-101, amending Knox County Code, Chapter 58, Article 3, entitled Hotel Occupancy Tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| to remove exceptions in the definition of hotel for rentals in residential settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| This amends Private Act 1982, Chapter 847, Private Act 1996, Chapter 628, Ordinance O-90-9-119,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=698)|
| 0:11:49| Subsection 1, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And Ordinance O-97-7-103, Subsection 1, adopted August 25, 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I think that, go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I'd like to make a motion that we move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| We have a motion sent forward with no recommendation, with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Before we have the vote, I'll go ahead and call Sherry down if you want to kind of give us an update on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| And for the audience, if you're wondering when we're sending something forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| what that means is we're sending it to next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| so the ordinances, you have to have the vote taken care of at the official county commission meeting, not the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| But, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Commissioners, this has gone to the legislature and passed an act to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| and now we are sending it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| And this, what you will do, is simply granting me the authority to collect this tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| So, we hope that we'll be seeing lots come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| It's really just equalizing what people are paying with the hotel-motel tax in a private residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| So, that's what had to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I just wanted to recognize that our two former Knox County commissioners were deeply involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Commissioner Dave Wright from the 8th District carried it in the House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| and he actually had to appear before four separate committees in the legislature to get this act passed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| And I think Senator Briggs had to appear before two committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| And Senator Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Yes, and Senator Massey as well, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| But, anyways, we appreciate their efforts on helping us out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| It seems fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| And are there any other questions for the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| We'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| That's Charlie Clark-Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Page 10, item number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| Page 10, item number 55 is Resolution R-20-7-901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| authorizing the issuance of Revenue Anticipation Notes Series 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $1,500,000 of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| making provision for the issuance, sale, and payment of said notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=875)|

| 0:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Could I get a motion on this item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| As this is a bond issuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| I suspect that the proper motion will be to send forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| for approval at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| We have a motion from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Is there a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Clerk Susano, if you could kind of approach, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Charlie Susano, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| If you could kind of give us, you know, we've heard a lot about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| This is one of the ones that we probably, speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| we've all done some research on going into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And, you know, maybe speaking for myself, on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| initially the thought was, hey, is this going to be coming from our fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| And now we see this is going to be revenue obligation bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| which will have not the same kind of impact on our fund balance, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| But if you could kind of operationally kind of bring us up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Your office pays for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| And, you know, do you see trends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| I know things it seems like we're going to be slowing things down a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| But kind of give us, you know, the short-term, long-term plans on where you're going on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Well, I know Chris Caldwell wants to speak on this matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| First, if you'll allow me, I just want to recognize a few folks real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Esther Roberts is here on behalf of the General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| She is the judicial clerk for General Sessions Court, here to answer questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| And I would like to recognize several members of my staff that should probably be home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| but they came in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| I would like to ask most of them to go ahead and leave now, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| It's a very dedicated and hardworking staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| They serve the public well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| They serve the courts well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| They really should just be home with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| So I thank them for being here, but I'll move forward without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| Just a little bit, you know, you've got some information in front of you about our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| In particular, Civil Sessions Court has seen significant revenue losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| So with this pandemic, you know, unforeseen, and it's affected us quite significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| we want to plan ahead in case we see other closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| in case the Supreme Court closes courts down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| which is always going to be a possibility during this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| So this $1.5 million line of credit, as suggested by county finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| allows us to draw down as needed should we continue to see these revenue losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| We've begun to see an uptick in new case filings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| That's hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| But when you have a 50% to 70% loss in the revenues that pay for the staff and office to function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| you can imagine that's significantly hard to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| So what this does is allow us sort of a backstop that if things don't improve in the short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| if there's multiple closures, if the Supreme Court closes us down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| what this allows us to do is keep a staff in place to continue to serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| In the information that we provided you, although case filings are down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| and have significantly decreased the revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| we still have more than 67,000 open case files in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| There is a variety of things we do procedurally to look after those files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| to manage and maintain those files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| People are still coming in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Phone calls are still coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| We have to have the proper people in place to serve the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| to serve the families, to serve the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| so that they can receive access to justice that they are promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| So by and large, that is what we hope for this to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| to give us that opportunity to continue to pay our salaries, to pay our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| but at the same time, hopefully when things get back to where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| we'll be able to return the balance, pay back the remainder of the line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| At this point, I'd like Chris to speak on behalf of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| I know Commissioner Andrews' lights came on and Commissioner Daly's was on earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| but if you like, I will go ahead and let Chris step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Brad, can your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Just to go ahead and clarify some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| while this resolution does say it's a tax anticipation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| make no mistake, the money will come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| It's just how the state makes you do the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| So are we issuing any additional note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| It will be straight from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And so when this situation occurs, you basically have three options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| and given this timing, we have four options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| So option one would have been to do a short-term note of less than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| and if we were to do that, then that money has to be paid back in less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| We chose not to do that option in this case because, we'll touch on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1208)|
| 0:20:18| in this office, the revenue and expenses are so close, it's very thin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| and so they have to get back to like 93% of case filings to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| And so we didn't feel like paying that back in less than a year was an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Option number two would be for us to refund him his excess fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| for what he's paid since he's been in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| That would be to the tune of $45,000 and let him make those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| Given the nature of payroll, I don't think that $45,000 would cure this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1252)|
| 0:21:02| Option number three is to simply do a budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| and bring them on under our budget system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| meaning that they would act as in a county department similar to the assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| or similar to juvenile court is now, meaning all his revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| all expenses would come under the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| and we would do a budget amendment to account for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| Of course, the expenses would exceed the revenue, so you'd still be using fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| We have a fourth option because we're in the middle of a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| and there's a state of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and so that allows us to issue this TAN for greater than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| And so we chose that option simply for the reason of having longer to pay it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| and that's why this option was selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| and was a recommendation from myself and the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| We chose $1.5 million simply because if you look at the salaries in this office for FY19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1332)|
| 0:22:23| it's about $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| We knew we had to get approval not only from county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| but you have to get approval from the comptroller's office when you are applying for this TAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| And so what I did not want to do was go back to the comptroller's office more than once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| and so if we would have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| let's go for a smaller amount, like $200,000, then things get worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| and you have to go back to the comptroller's office, that's what I did not want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| So I wanted to ask for an amount that we know would be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| We can treat it as a line of credit until 6-30-21, then it has to be booked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| and so at that point it will be booked as an inter-fund loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| And so that's probably a lot of accounting jargon for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| but that's kind of the specifics behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| If you have any questions related to the structure or why we did what we did, I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1399)|
| 0:23:28| Anything related to the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I guess I would say just thank you for the clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| because when we read the caption, at least when I read the caption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| and when it says issuance of a note, that's kind of the same language that we use when we issue a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| It is. It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It's the caption that the state mandates we treat it as an inter-fund loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| So it will go from our general fund over to the constitutional office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to go through my lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| We've got Commissioner Daley and then Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| Thank you for all of these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Looking back at June 19 and June 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| it looks like things were picking up even though you were still off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Are you meeting payroll now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| No. We are currently, I think, under about $30,000 shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1455)|
| 0:24:29| Now, again, we serve three courts, so juvenile court does not factor into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| I want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| So between civil sessions and circuit court, circuit's off about 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| You can see the losses in civil off about 50 to 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| So about a $30,000 shortfall per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Do you expect that to keep going on for the next two, three, four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| It looks like to me it's picking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| That's the question I wish I could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| We've seen a 30 percent uptick in this past month of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| We expect the same 30 percent uptick or hopefully more in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| That's sort of the way that it's trending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| But, again, we have to factor in potential closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| We try to stay in touch with the Supreme Court as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| to see if they're giving any indications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| If the pandemic percentages continue to increase, there may be more closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1522)|
| 0:25:31| Take a look around this yellow tape here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| This is what we've done to make sure we are able to hear more cases in civil sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| To move the court in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| We hear cases here now four days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| That will end August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| We're working on another plan moving forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| It's all in combination with the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Whether or not law offices and businesses are fully functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| are still at a decreased function, thereby limiting the number of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| that they're going to file in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| We hope we see improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| But this is our plan if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| This is a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| This is not handing you guys money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| This is a loan that if you borrow from it, the taxpayers will get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| You will make sure that it gets back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I just want to make sure everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| This is not something that you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| It's something that you're going to draw from, and you will pay back over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| whatever that time period is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you very much for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| And staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Charlie, I'll support it because I think it's the smartest thing that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| probably as a county can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| But I think there's some questions that we should publicly talk about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| Your courts were closed for a couple of months, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| And everybody else in the county made some adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| and your office didn't make adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So moving forward, if there is a closure and you've got this payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| or this line of credit, what's your measuring stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and what choices are you going to be making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| You've got to have some plan B, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| And so what is your plan B if courts don't open back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| or your revenue doesn't hit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I mean, how long do you continue operating in the red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And what adjustments are you going to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Thanks for the question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| If I can address a little bit just previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| and I think you got the information that we talked about furloughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| We're prepared to furlough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| But when the Supreme Court came back and said you're going back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| we don't have non-essential employees, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| We keep the bare number of employees around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| When the courts closed down, we had several people that we did send home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| They were in at-risk categories, immunocompromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| We have three people out of maternity leave right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| so they fell into that category and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| But when the Supreme Court comes back with the order that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| we're going to begin in-person hearings, we did bring everybody back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So moving forward, if the courts were to close down again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| and we were not having in-person hearings, particularly down at Juvenile Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| where we operate nine courtrooms and in civil sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| then we would have to make adjustments as far as staff goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| So we've looked at different models, whether it's reducing staff hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| or potential layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| We have discussed those matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| and are prepared to take some type of action as far as our staff goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| if the courts close again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Now, we anticipate revenues getting back up to where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| There's no reason to think that they won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| which for us in civil sessions is approximately 1,700 cases per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| We expect it to get back up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| and we can maintain our current staffing level if and when it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| But if for some reason, due to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| unforeseen that we don't get back up to that level, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| as quickly as we would like, we will have to look at staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| It's difficult, and I speak only for our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| because even though case filings are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| we still have an obligation to serve and staff the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| and be there for the public for whatever they may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| When you have 67,000 active cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| they still need attention for any number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| But the revenue losses are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| We hope and plan for those to go back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| But like you said, if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| we will certainly have to address staffing at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| to try to reduce the payroll if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Do you know what those benchmarks are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Have you finalized that conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I would say, talking with our bookkeepers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| and we have bookkeepers in each court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| but particularly in civil sessions where we've seen the losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| that number is 1,500 to 1,700 new case filings per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and we can maintain at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| When you operate on just 12.5% of the fees that you bring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| and I hope this body understands that, and I believe that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| we bring in plenty of fees to support an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| We only get to keep 12.5% of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| So we work on a very close margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| We can manage with small fluctuations, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| We might get down to 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| We might get up to 2,000 new case filings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| 2,000 being really the high mark for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| But as a general rule, 20,000 case filings per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| You can see that we are significantly off that mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| and it just translates to less dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But that is our benchmark, if you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| That's where we can maintain, and we have good years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| and we have years that are not as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I've only been in the office since fiscal year 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| but it remains fairly steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| But when you have a once-in-100-year pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| things change pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And can people electronically file court filings now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Not in our court as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| When I took office, it remains in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| It remains something that we are continually working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Is that legislative, or is that budgetary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| We've been working with Clerk and Master Hogan on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| about changing our fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| and continually moving towards electronic filing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| But I think that's a Knox County issue with IT and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| We spent the first year and, I don't know, 10 months I've been in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| and been able to get, for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| circuit court records and civil session records online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| so that the legal community, the pro se community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| the public at large, has access to those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| You pay a subscription fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| That's been one way we've tried to increase revenues in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| So that was really our first goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Knox County needs to move into an electronic filing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| and so we are looking at ways to begin that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| and hopefully see that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| And, Charlie, I appreciate you and the staff work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| but I wish we had started with an overview of what it is the clerk office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| And I appreciate the circuit juvenile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and I think we need to civil session courts to just give people an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| of the work your office and personnel does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| so that we can have a broader understanding of what that is for the public's sake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| as we vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| because some of what you said may make a little more sense to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| if we had a broader view of what the work that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| and that your staff accomplishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Sure. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Let me just say this about the—our office serves three courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| and civil sessions court is known as small claims court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| typically lawsuits under $25,000, including personal injury, writs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| detainer warrants, you know, warrants to remove people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| that are unlawfully occupying a home, structures, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| property disputes, auto accidents, business disputes, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| So it's a small claims court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| It's not a court of record, so the volume is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Sometimes a docket will have 400 to 500 cases a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| 100 plus today, but it can be as high as—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| So you can imagine typically the general sessions judges hear cases three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| Because of this pandemic and because we want to give people better access to justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| we've gone to four days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| But it's a heavy volume court, and it moves fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| So you can imagine there's a great deal of paperwork to be processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| We are charged with staffing the courts with clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| We have any number of people in the office handling things such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| child support payments, garnishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We move our civil sessions court to live operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| I think for years it operated on an automated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I feel like the public likes to get a person on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| and we've had good success with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| So this court is, again, and we've got juvenile court and circuit court as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| but this court clicks along at a pretty heavy pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| and it pays the majority of our bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Would you just outline what that is so people in the public can know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| The fee generating structure and the amount that you do generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| The fee structure, majority of the fees collected are held for litigants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| or passed through to fund local and state government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| In the fiscal year 2019, our office collected over $13 million in fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| of which over just $2.5 million was distributed to Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| And we support the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| We support the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| We support the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Again, only 12.5% of collected fees remain available to service our courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Are we looking in the future to change that on a legislative level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| We feel it would be beneficial to our court to lobby the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| not necessarily to increase the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| I don't believe there's been a fee increase in this office since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| A fee increase for $2 in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| So we are talking about lobbying the legislature so that we might be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| keep a higher percentage of the fees that we work for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| that we pay our salaries with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| That would be beneficial to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| And so we've been talking with Clerk Hogan again on maybe changing some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| the ways we structure our fees, perhaps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| But, yes, we want to lobby our legislators to maybe change the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| what we've got coming in a little more of it stays with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And that's our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And we'll work to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Commissioner Jay and then Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Mr. Suzzano, you said 12.5% of your fees are kept internally to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Can you help us understand where the other 87 and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| you mentioned sheriff and library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| What's the breakdown of where the rest of those fees go to support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Let me see if I can give you a specific breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| You know, you've got, for example, and this is fiscal year 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| This is just, I believe, one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| This was June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| The fees went to library litigation tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| $39,000 plus the county litigation tax, judges retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| data processing, $35,000 to the sheriff, victim litigation tax, $7,800,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| jail security litigation tax, $39,000, school debt litigation tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| also $39,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Now, that total is about $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And you do that 12 months, you get about $2.1 million that's going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So, you know, when I say our office brings in plenty of fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| generates plenty of fees to more than pay for the adequate number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| people to serve the courts, to staff the courts and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| we've got a lot going out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| So that gets you to about $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| I believe another $400,000 or so, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Is that right, Sheila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Another $400,000 or so goes to state litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| So, you know, that's $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Now, the other monies, Commissioner Jay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| we are a pass-through in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| So we hold monies for litigants and heirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| so monies that are paid through our court and then are issued back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| those litigants and heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| And then one other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| what is the amount of excess fees paid back to Knox County above and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| beyond the budget for the last two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| I believe we made a payment this year of $25,000 and the year before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| that $20,000, so a total of $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Do I have that backwards or is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I've got it backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| So before COVID, the last two years have been evident that it pays for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| itself and then some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Yeah, and I think those are the first monies that have been returned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| the county in the form of excess fees since 2011, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| This question is for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2404)|
| 0:40:14| Chris, the last couple of years I've had the opportunity to meet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Deputy Commissioner for the Comptroller of the Treasury, Jason Munpower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| and we talk about other counties across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| what their financial condition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| and I've related some of those stories back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| Are you aware of any other county in Tennessee that's having the same kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| of situation, is doing the same kind of financial transaction as we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| getting ready to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| Blount County is doing the same sort of greater than one year tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| anticipation, no, but it's related to their hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| They have a county-ran hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| Other than that, I have not heard from any of my peers about this going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| so I've not heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I can't say that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| You know, I mentioned last month that I think some of our fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| when they get, you know, they have that three-month reserve that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| supposed to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| If not, it goes to excess fees, and some are falling below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| and so I guess there's an idea of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And so I think if you talk to maybe our other clerks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| you may hear a similar story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| But I have not heard from any of my colleagues about this across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| And, you know, one of the things that we have enjoyed is a good reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| with the Comptroller of the Treasury, not only for our financial situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| but just our good, clean audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Would this in any way affect our reputation at all because it is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| small amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I mean, if we have a reason that we're getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| I don't think that they're going to look negatively on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| because we're saying what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| You know, we've got to spell out a timeline of when that will be paid back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| so we want to stick to that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I just did not want to go to the Comptroller more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| for the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| And so I don't think we will be looked negatively on for requesting the TAN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| so long as we stick to what our guidelines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I would imagine they would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| I think you run into a bigger issue if you don't address the situation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| one of the four points that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Charlie, I've got a couple questions, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I hate to ask you this in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| but I think that things like this need to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| If things continue like they are and you need $30,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| $40,000 a month to make payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I'm assuming that any repayment would have to come from excess fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| We've not talked about the structure of the repayment plan as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| If it didn't, it would simply be taking money from the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| the Library Department, these other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| I think so those fees are by statute where they have to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| so you can't pull from those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| What has to happen, and that's the point that I was making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| is that they run on such thin margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I think we looked at it as like 93 percent to break even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| so they have to get above that break-even point to start to pay back a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| So I'm going to imagine that we'd be paying back the line of credit before we turn over excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| But I think the key is to get back to what whole is, and whole is 93 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| and then start to pay back whatever that line of credit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| and we'll book that June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| But it would come from basically excess fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| Instead of excess fees, it would be paying down the line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Right, but we're only showing $45,000 for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| That's enough to borrow for maybe two months against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I think to that point, we knew that going a year or less, that option was not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2696)|
| 0:45:08| There's no way that this office on those margins could pay that back in less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| So we'll have to come up with some sort of repayment schedule that we think is realistic and can be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| Okay, one more question for you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Commissioner, can I just real quick address your question a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| You know, it's a revenue model that we inherited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and I don't know that it's something that I think needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| I think lobbying the legislature perhaps for a greater amount of the fees, but it is the way things were set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2736)|
| 0:45:45| So we try to work within that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| We've tried to increase our revenues by the subscription service and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| and we certainly are looking for other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| I hope that our first reaction is not to say the first thing we should do is just lay off a bunch of people so we can save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2757)|
| 0:46:09| And the reason I say that is we have to look at the amount of time, the man hours, the training that we spend on our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2769)|
| 0:46:21| You know, they dedicate their lives to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| They are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| They are specialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| And, you know, I'm always going to look for ways before we have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| because I think you have to look at the cost on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Where those people go, they still have to put food on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| They can't wait around for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| So if we have to rehire, we start from point one, and that takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| That takes man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| That takes money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| So, you know, I always fight for my people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I always fight for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| But, you know, the revenue model I think needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Again, we bring in plenty of money in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| We just don't get to keep enough of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Charlie, how many of your people make over $45,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I know that the 15 people, Commissioner, that work in the Civil Sessions office make an average of about $34,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2836)|
| 0:47:28| I've got, including myself, our Chief Deputy, our Director at Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2848)|
| 0:47:38| I'd have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| You know, I've got it right here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| If you want me to tell you on the spot, I'll be glad to count them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| No, I was just wondering what percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| The reason why I'm asking is people that were furloughed from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| if they were making less than $45,000 with the CARES Act and unemployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| were actually making more than their day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Again, I ask you that question because you said you weren't able to furlough people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| but yet I read in an article where your staff worked one week on, one week off for about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| So you only needed half of them, half the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| This was when the courts were closed, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| So when the courts are open, we need our full staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Do you have a plan moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Because it doesn't seem that things are getting much better with the pandemic at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| Well, we have seen those revenue losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Now it's been over a short period of time, you know, really beginning in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| So, like I said before, we have begun to see an uptick in cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| We certainly hope we continue to see that uptick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Are they new cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Are they resurrected cases that, after a pause, are starting to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| These are new case filings, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I'm kind of worried moving forward that we've had this standstill period in our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| that there might not be as many suits coming because there wasn't as much activity during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I don't think – I would argue that that's not exactly how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| But I agree with you that, I mean, these are significant revenue losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| If they were continued, then that revenue model certainly has to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| And if, you know, we have to go be at less than full staff to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| then I suppose that's what we would have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| It's not something we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Would you be opposed to coming back monthly or every other month to give us a report on how things – how cases are going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| I wouldn't be opposed to anything you need, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I'd be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| And I really do appreciate the work you and your staff do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Are there any other questions from our fellow commissioners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| With this, this is – I'm going to look to the law director on this, but this is an item that we can put on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| or is this something we're going to need to send forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I'd send it without recommendation because it's like a bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| All right, just confirming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Yes, I had one last question for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Usually salaries are considered operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| Are we okay using fund balance for something that's not a one-time expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| In this case, it's considered a loan, and what he's using it for is – it could be recurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3019)|
| 0:50:28| but I think in this situation it's fine because we're considering it a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| I think I would point out, too, what we can do, and we can do this every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| is assuming county commission approves this vehicle payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| then what we will do is monthly work with Charlie's office to pay whatever he needs for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3044)|
| 0:50:55| So we're not going to give him a lump sum of $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| We'll pay what is needed every month, and then we can bring that amount to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| and then once we see us hitting what that ceiling is, we can let you know truly what the amount is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3065)|
| 0:51:13| and then we will work through what payback terms are and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| But ultimately, my expectation and my hope is this does not get to $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| and that we'll be at a number far less than that, and then we can bring that amount to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| Unfortunately, we do have to book something by next June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| And do you know what the interest will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Because I'm assuming this is coming out of a fund that we're collecting interest on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| So we did interest at 0% for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| We currently at BB&T are overnight rates, 100 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| I don't know what year this is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| So Charlie will draw some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| My biggest concern is just getting the loan paid back in whatever terms we put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3119)|
| 0:52:10| so we don't raise any red flags with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I believe Commissioner Jay had another question, and then I'll go back to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| We've talked about this, but I have to remind there the motion on the floor was actually made by Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker, and it is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| But back to Commissioner Jay and then over to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you. Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Other than perhaps some of the legal language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| how is this any different from the loan that this commission unanimously approved to support the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| which I think has a payback period of could be up to 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| It's viewed differently because from the state standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| if a fee office cannot support itself from a fee standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| then it technically can't be a fee office anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| and then it would have to be brought in under the county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| The other loan would be completely separate from us because they're a separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| I'm trying to find out why there's so much consternation over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| When we gave a $500,000 loan to an entity that based upon sales tax of motel and hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| that we don't know if it will come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and this is constitutionally mandated services to the community and juveniles and court systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| which are part of our structure of our government, and we're having heartburn over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| I think it should be done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| but I think we ought to support our team and ride it through as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| So thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I think ultimately my concern is that we don't put terms on the agreement that we can't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| That could cause an audit issue or an issue with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Back to you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Chris, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| We're just going to make sure we're on item 55, and it's 901, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| And the statement has been made from the podium that we don't have a payment plan set up yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| and it was zero interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| The wording in the document has 4% interest, and I may be reading too much into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| and the actual caption says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Making provision for the issuance, sale, and payment of these notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| establishing the terms thereof, and a disposition of proceeds therefrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| So if we haven't set those things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Let me check on that 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| That could have come from just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| It looks like it's from a copy-paste of a generic bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| It probably was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| We'll follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| We were going to go with zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Well, I think. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| It's zero up to 4%, so we could set it for whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| But we chose. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Chose zero, which is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Well, I think in going back to the discussion about the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| the zoo made catastrophic quick differences in how they laid off 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| I mean, there's a big difference in how these two operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| I mean, both of them are great operations, and I think the investments are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| but if you look at the terms of this deal and breakevens 93%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| I don't know that you'd book it before June if we continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I don't understand how we're going to roll and book it with audit until next June as it's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| That's the only concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I said earlier when I started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| I mean, if you look at the terms that are in this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| there's no way if he doesn't hit 105% of cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| or if he doesn't get up around 1,800, he can't pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| So then what do we do in June with the comptroller's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| So what's that step in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Yeah, so for us it would be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| We will watch and meet with them monthly to see how their filings are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| If we get to June and we're still not at that 93%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| then we'll have to make a determination, an estimate on what we want that loan amount to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3376)|
| 0:56:24| So we'll sit down with Charlie and we'll come up with an amount that that loan should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| finalize what we loan and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And then if it goes above that, we'd have to go back to the comptroller for a new loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| We'll have to make a decision on what amount we're going to book by June up to the 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3398)|
| 0:56:47| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Just to answer my question, because I think we alluded to 1.6 at one point in the conversation, but it is 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| It is 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| What I had mentioned was their salaries totaled 1.6 in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| So that's how we got to 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| All right, seeing no additional lights, to restate the motion that was made by Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| seconded by Commissioner Schoonmakers to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| If there are any other additional questions that have come up over this week, we'll be able to vet that out at next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| So all in favor of this motion, which is properly before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| We're back to page two, item number eight, Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| It's appointing or reappointing an individual for District 2 seat and District 5 seat to the Knox County Library Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3463)|
| 0:57:55| Okay, I think the motion is proper on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I've still got some open vacancies here, so do we want to send this one forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| or I'm going to look at John and Michelle and just say, you guys got any leads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| Do you think we might have something by next week, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Yeah, move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Motion is sent forward with no recommendations from the maker, with a second by Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| and we'll see if we can get those names filled in by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| All right, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| Number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Page 5, item number 25 is Resolution 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| It's approving a contract with Rouse Construction Company at an estimated cost of $19 million for the construction of a new Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Could I have a motion for approval on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Okay, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I believe that's Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| So, Russ, I'm the one who, frankly, pulled this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| And whenever you see a number that big, you know, it's probably best not to let it slide through on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| But just add how we were looking on cost, timeline, the contract on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| If you guys could just kind of give us an update on where you're forecasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| And is that pretty firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Are we all in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Is there a chance it could come in below it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| So just the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I guess, Commissioner, what I would like to say is this project and the project at item number 27 that we pulled as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| those are county-led projects, and we're in a support role on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| So I'd like to stand here and take credit for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| But I'd prefer to let Matt and Parks and Rec talk about those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Okay, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Matt Myers, Knott County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I believe the way this got on the school's consent is when we were given a green light to go, we're going to construct a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| We were sent it to the BOEs to get on their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Obviously, it flowed on over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| So it is a county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| I think the first question you had is the $19 million of firm price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Well, I'm not going to stand here and ask Mr. Caldwell for any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| So, yes, sir, that's a firm not to exceed price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| We have a lot of work to do in that $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| There's been a few changes in codes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| But we look forward to the challenge, and we'll certainly make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| This is a little different, but whenever we do this and we started planning this, does recode affect anything that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3632)|
| 1:00:41| I'm sorry, again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Has it affected any of the costs or anything like that that we might have to tweak or change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I'm sorry, I still didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| The city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| We haven't done any zoning yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| No, we don't plan on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Sorry about that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| All right, we've got two other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Does that answer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| So we've got Commissioner Guild and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| And you answered my initial question about the contractor and subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| making sure that we look to have a broader conversation with our community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| and partners under the Urban League and some of the minority subcontractors to be involved in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| And you answered my question about the school systems and AIA under Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| so I really appreciate the support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Could you talk to me about the timeframe associated with this, the number of students on a broader scale that will be in this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3705)|
| 1:01:56| Because we discussed 600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| Is that still the direction we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Well, I spoke with Mr. Oaks as I came in the door, and I think they ended the school year with about 450 in both schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| Lonsdale and Sammy Hill, and I don't necessarily want to speak for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| So we're looking roughly about 450 when the school opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Could be a little more, could be a little less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Looking at a timeframe, we're actually trying to get a meeting scheduled next Thursday to get this ball rolling and get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| We're looking at a couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Yes, and I still think the conversation to deal appropriately with the existing school of Lonsdale and Sammy Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| in the middle of a pandemic to provide an opportunity for families at Sammy Hill for free daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| as well as an expanded program for Head Start, because Head Start currently in that district is at the community center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3765)|
| 1:02:53| as well as at the CAC building on Western, to better provide additional supports for families in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| as well as looking at an appropriate response to the existing Lonsdale school for an entrepreneurial center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| a library, as well as a senior facility, because it doesn't exist in that part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| And I think we make decisions to build schools without dealing with the appropriate and existing infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| because once those schools are subtracted out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| we'll be in the process of trying to deal with how to serve the needs of those community members on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you. All right. Thanks, Mr. Gil. Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Stay there, please. Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| I'm going to make you walk all the way down here and then you may not even have a response to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| But I believe the last I may be wrong on this. The last elementary school we built might have been Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| The county built it, I believe. We've built some middle school since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Has there been any changes in codes for schools that are different from when we built that that may add to the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| And have you and procurement on the same page on what changes have been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| Doug Dillingham, 912 South K Street. Commissioner, yes, there have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| Probably the most significant change is when the county adopted the 2018 International Building Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| It now requires storm shelters in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| The required area in Knox County, the eastern border of that kind of bisects the county from northeast to southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3876)|
| 1:04:49| It's our intent and our stance that we can't put storm shelters in some of our buildings and not put them in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3889)|
| 1:04:59| We will be putting storm shelters in all of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Any idea what kind of cost run up that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| The only anecdotal information that I have is from Middle Tennessee down in the Mount Juliet area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| which was hit by tornadoes and they're in the process of rebuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| And we have some of our consulting engineers that have been involved in those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| And they're saying somewhere in the 10 to 12 percent additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3927)|
| 1:05:36| I kind of take that with a grain of salt because it's typically more expensive in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| The research I've done in the past, it could be anywhere from $10 to $20 a square foot more expensive down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| And we're talking about the Nashville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Is it also more about utility, your ability to utilize that space that's dedicated as a storm center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3953)|
| 1:06:03| We're here in the infancy of trying to figure all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| As a matter of fact, I have scheduled a roundtable for Thursday morning to talk to our designers about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3968)|
| 1:06:16| and to try to develop some program standards for Knox County Schools moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| so that we're looking at the same type thing everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| I thought at one time that it might be better if we had something like in a basement area that was better protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| but I'm slowly but surely changing my mind because I'm seeing where other areas are using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| like gymnasiums and cafeterias and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| So yes, they are used during the regular course of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| but you have to make certain concessions to be able to switch them over to emergency mode, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4012)|
| 1:07:02| Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| All right. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Who had the first and the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| All right. We had Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Biggs with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| It's properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| All right. The next item is, while I'm talking, I'll go ahead and jump in on this one, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| It's item 27, R-20-7-219,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| approving the request of Legacy Parks Foundation to construct a public access ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| and dock for Beaver Creek property on the location at Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Yes, as he had mentioned, that is more of a county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| I didn't pull it because of any financial concerns, but really, in terms of amenities for our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| we have been making a big focus on Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| I know Commissioner Jay has been really involved out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| When this came before us, I thought it would be a good time for just a brief update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| what this amenity is going to mean for the community out there and the timeline on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| First, I'll need a motion, which I see Commissioner Jay with a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Is there a second on this one for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| All right. So we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay and a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Who's going to handle the update on this? I'm seeing Mr. White out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Paul, if you could please step forward and give us a quick update on how things are moving out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| Paul White, 2447 Sutherland Avenue Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| We're excited to be in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Like you said, Commissioner Jay is heavily involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Legacy Parks is working on getting this kayak launch and dock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| In Beaver Creek, there's a lot of momentum and a lot of excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| It's going to be ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Our goal is to have it done and ready by August 29th for the flotilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| Also, the county and Parks and Rec, we will maintain that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| It also meets the mayor and all of your desire to have a Beaver Creek access from one end of the county to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4162)|
| 1:09:35| Our goal is that you can access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Eventually, we can have a water trail from Falls all the way to Mountain Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| Like a greenway on the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| A lot of people call them water trails or blueways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| We're really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| We feel like the Powell community has taken a really big part in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4194)|
| 1:10:03| We're really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| I see Commissioner Biggs and Commissioner Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| You made the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I'll call on you, and then I'm going to just go in the order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Commissioner Jay, then Commissioner Biggs, then Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| I just wanted to add a little bit more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| This boat ramp, the majority of funding for this came from a grant from TWRA, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and Legacy Parks, the two entities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4222)|
| 1:10:34| But TWRA really put a majority of the funding into it and made it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| It's been a big community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| It should, I hope, be the model for what put-ins and take-outs could look like down the road across all of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| It should be up here in just about four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Good reason to renew your hunting and fishing license to get some good revenue for TWRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| Back to you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| I was just going to basically say what Commissioner Jay said, and then also say Director White's done an amazing job out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4260)|
| 1:11:10| It's very heavily used, and whenever you guys went through and redid the bridge area by Broadacres and the Wiggles Farm, you guys have done such a great job out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4270)|
| 1:11:20| Kudos to you and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I know it's a lot of hard manual labor, but thank you for everything you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I do apologize for not recognizing Commissioner Jay and taking a big lead in the TWRA grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| He and Carol Evans at Legacy Park have done a really major job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| We are really proud to come alongside in the future and continue to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| The mayor has a specific plan for not only that area but the entire creek that we could really make it a premier area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4310)|
| 1:12:02| We really appreciate Commissioner Jay and everyone in there and Mayor Jacobs in their involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| Legacy Park's TWRA, like I said, the Beaver Creek Kayak Club, we have a lot of people to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| We really appreciate all your involvement and the people who have championed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| I just want to confirm that this was a motion to approve, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| Yes, that was a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| And that will place it on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Seeing no other lights, once again, the motion for approval came from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| It was seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Seeing no other discussion, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4367)|

| 1:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Could I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Is that you, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I thought we had 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Did I miss that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| 31 was to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| That one's been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Yeah, that one has been added, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| That was added, but not pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| So we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I'll make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Was that Commissioner Smith on the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Motion for approval on item 35 from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| This is second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| By the way, Jim, please come forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| I do want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| I'm the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| I pulled both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| They're not just that fact that, you know, they're fairly large numbers for our capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| budget, but, you know, that's one of our bigger projects happening in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| So whenever we've got an opportunity to get an update from you, both kind of on timelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| you know, this is the money we're appropriating, but it's for that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| But, you know, how many fiscal years is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| You know, what's the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Is that going to be this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| I think the public would have an interest in knowing how many years that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| be hitting timeline and update on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| So state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Then I'm going to go straight to Commissioner Anders, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Sure, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| As you noted, this is a very large project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| When me and Matt Myers talked about it, he thought it might be the biggest project they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| ever led as a single entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| So it's been accumulation of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I started buying the right-of-way on this project in 2003 as a newly hired project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| and got to know a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Over 200 tracks of land out there we acquired, so I'm glad to see it finally come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| This project is scheduled to take approximately three calendar years to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| It's four miles of four-lane roadway, has two bridges that cross CSX Railway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| so a pretty complicated project for the county and will require approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| about three years, so it will be spread out over multiple fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Chris Caldwell and I have discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| Right now we have about $32 million in the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| That money also pays for Phase 4, which is the section from Pleasant Ridge Road to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| So we will have to infuse a little more money into this account over the next couple of fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| but nothing of great significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| But it's our hope to get started on this this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and hopefully have the roadway complete within the next three years or the fall of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Is that an Alabama face mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| That is Atlanta Braves. Don't cuss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| Commissioner, you know, the Health Department does do eyeglass screenings as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| so we can kind of check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Yeah, I know. He is so smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I know that he wouldn't commit such poor judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Moving on to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Yeah, Jim, I just wanted to talk about Phase 4 a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| I know it's inside the $45 million, $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| When is it going to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Is it going to be concurrent a little bit, or is there going to be some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Don't we build a little bit of overlap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| We've started buying right-of-way right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| That's been slowed due to the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Obviously, a lot of people, you know, that right-of-way negotiation takes a lot of face-to-face interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| which some people aren't comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| But we are kind of got that started back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| We would anticipate starting construction of Phase 4 hopefully sometime next summer or next fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| So there will be a period of about 18 months, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| I guess in calendar year 22 that you see both ongoing at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| What about Cedardale to Lovell and to Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| What about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Is it going to be three-lane or four-lane all the way as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| It's going to be five-lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| That's the section that it's five-lane on the Lovell side, four-lane on the Middlebrook Pike side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| We went through the – we're actually still in the NEPA phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| We are, through the TPO, funding the local mites for that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| and we're managing it on behalf of TDOT to expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| So that project will probably – about the time these are complete, it will get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| It's a little bit slower-moving engine because of the TPO funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| So we'll have four lanes all the way from Clinton and Callaghan –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| or I mean 75 and Callaghan to Lovell and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| That's pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| In five years, we'll have all that, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| About a little over 13 miles for the whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| But, yeah, that's going to be exciting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| That's really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Commissioner Smith, your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Brad asked exactly what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Any additional lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| With the amount of that, I know the motion was for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| I'm just wondering if we've got any guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| I mean I would almost rather send forward with – no, we're talking $45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Is that something we can put on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| I'll look to you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I mean that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| It's like $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I mean I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| It's not a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| The motion is for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| And, Jim, just stay there because, frankly, I lumped the two of these together because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| they were related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| And it's item 37, which is R-27-406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4729)|

| 1:19:05| But we did get that contract, I believe, this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| So, all of you now have got a copy of the contract that was not available until this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4754)|

| 1:20:44| And I knew that – I kind of wanted to find out is this going to be our one-time kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| of reimbursement for some of the expenses we've already spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| I'm sure this is federal money that's passed through to the state that's coming out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| But also, what are you all hearing in terms of maybe any additional monies coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4859)|

| 1:21:07| This grant does allow us to backdate our expenses to March, potentially January, depending upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| And it goes through March of the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| They will allow us to roll any additional funding over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| It will take care of a majority of the costs that we have accumulated for the COVID response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| Also allow us to outsource some staffing to bring in to give our much-needed workers a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| break, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Well, and I saw there's – I didn't actually pull it, but since you brought it up, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| there was a – there's another agenda item on here related to a contract for some work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| I think, with the company over in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| So –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| There's actually four other additional contracts for outsourcing services, various staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| Well, this – you mentioned that some of this can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| Are there – any of you all's fixed costs that you made that have – where you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| have had a staff member that was doing this, and then when the pandemic hit, they immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| started focusing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| So will some of our prior fixed costs maybe that are now pandemic-focused be able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| covered by this, or is this just for incremental costs that have been above and beyond normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Above and beyond right now, there is the potential of future CARES money coming the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| way to cover something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| We filled out a survey probably about a month ago, Mr. Caldwell and Susan Corlew, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| did include some of our past costs, mostly all of our county-funded positions that immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| shifted to COVID response, and therefore weren't allowed to do what they typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| do inside the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| That would be a big win if –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Yeah, because those are – yeah, kind of fixed costs right there, not just incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| I guess a question for you or Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| There's a release that just come out that there's an extra $115 million from the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| Do you know anything about that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| I don't currently have any details about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| Mr. Caldwell, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Other than it's upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4988)|

| 1:23:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| I probably received the same email that you did, and so that's what we have so far, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| there's not really any details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| What we will do is Kevin will work with Susan Corlew and my department, who's handled all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| of our COVID-19 grant funding, and we'll get in touch with the state to figure out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| qualifies for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| They really not gave any parameters besides what's on that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Are there any other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I mean, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5027)|

| 1:23:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| One thing Dr. Buchanan brought up that she wanted me to clarify, this funding actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| comes from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| So it does not take away immediately from that $115 million that is potentially to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| allocated out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5045)|

| 1:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| That was 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| And then if I remember, we moved 55 to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| So we're number 56, resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| It's approving a contract with eGovernment Solutions LLC to provide an integrated SAAS-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| software platform to meet the tax and operational needs of the Knox County Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Commissioner Jay, I think were you the one who asked to have that one pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| So I'm going to go ahead and look to you for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Yeah, I think that was an item that you had pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| So I'll look to you for a motion and then we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| Is there any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| I'm going to look to Zach, I guess, to provide any extra insight on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| I don't know if anybody was here from the Trustee's Office or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| I know it's Trustee, but it's also computer rated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| By the way, I got a call today saying that they had no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| They couldn't track...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| They didn't even have me registered as having a computer, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Zach Webb, 400 Main Street, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Happy to field any questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I'm going to pull this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Happy to field any questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| This is a big step forward for the Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| We have an in-house software that's just over 20 years old currently in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| A lot of, let's just say, unique processes in place there to make the software work with our modern ERP financial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5148)|
| 1:25:57| So, this provides some integrated GL functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| Also, we'll provide a vendor-to-vendor tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| This is the same system that's in use in over 50 counties across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| We've demoed multiple systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| We were able to find and piggyback off of a Washington County contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| So, we've thoroughly researched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| The department has been through several other products, and this is the, in my opinion, the best product in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| And it's also a Knoxville-based company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| So, that's another plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Is there any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Commissioner Gill, your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Back to you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| And I commend the IT department because they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| And anytime we can upgrade our trustee's office or property assessor's office, it makes just the job so much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| And also, it's easy for the public now to be able to access some of that information that's online, and they do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| This is going to be a big step forward in that world, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| This is a fully cloud-hosted system, so it's going to be accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| We're going to be able to pull a lot of data that we can't do with our legacy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So, it's a big step forward, and we support the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| How soon will that be implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| So, it's still a little bit not fully locked and loaded on the go live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Roughly, we'll make it through this tax roll on the system that's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| We hope to have that in place in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Hey, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Item number 58, resolution 904, is to approve an appropriation in the amount of $100,000 from general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| non-departmental, or code to the Knox Education Foundation to provide internet access to students who do not currently have wired internet service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5274)|
| 1:28:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Could I get a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Deal with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| So, I know this came from the mayor's office originally reached out to me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| I've also heard from the chamber and a lot of really passionate folks in the community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| Mr. Caldwell, you're approaching if you wanted to speak to this on the perspective of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| I thought I saw Amy from the chamber here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| The mayor met with the chamber and the other parties involved, I guess, a couple of weeks ago about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5317)|
| 1:28:48| He is very supportive with the things that they have discussed and their path forward providing internet access to all kids in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5328)|
| 1:29:05| So, that's why the funding is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| I think there's going to be a match from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| And I think you all received the same handout that we had provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| And so, he is very supportive and was happy to sponsor this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| I think if you all wanted to co-sponsor, he wouldn't object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| But it's completely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| And I'll turn it over to Amy if she has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| Amy, you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| I'm wondering if all the commissioners want to sign on as co-sponsors on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| I know I helped bring it on there, but it's something that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| So, Madam Clerk and Drisilla, if you all could make sure that this, before it gets, when it gets passed, that it has all the county commissioners signed on as sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5386)|
| 1:29:55| And I'll go ahead and back to you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Could we ask Amy to come forward to just give a broad overview of this ENOX task force, the support for Knox County Schools for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5397)|
| 1:30:09| and what, looking at the issue of, especially the infrastructure in Knox County, by district that was contained on a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| I guess we don't have access to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Could we pull it up so that the public can see, by district, the level of deficiencies that are built into our infrastructure to help support students by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5420)|
| 1:30:33| so that they and their families can have access to the internet, and to talk about the findings and the recommendations and the budget and how we got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5433)|
| 1:30:45| I mean, I think we all are aware of COVID-19, but we need to speak specifically to issues of how we can address some of the needs in Knox County, there it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| by district and the infrastructure that will impact students and their families so that they can have access to educational opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5456)|
| 1:31:09| Sure. Amy Nolan, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| The ENOX task force was a group we put together, invited really a lot of folks to, probably in May, to look at what if, at that point we were hoping that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5472)|
| 1:31:26| what if we had to close schools at flu season, probably later in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| One of our challenges with coming up with any solutions is getting the data to find out where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| Providers have proprietary interest in that data, so they're not going to reveal, Comcast isn't going to tell you, hey, this is where we serve, this is not where we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5501)|
| 1:31:52| So in partnership with the Knox County Schools, actually did a telephone survey of households, and they came up with this aggregated data that we took a sample and extrapolated that from a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5512)|
| 1:32:09| One of the good things, big benefits of this, not only does this funding go towards short-term needs, emergency needs, but also will give us the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5529)|
| 1:32:20| because of Knox Education Foundation role, is to identify clusters, to identify problem areas, so we can create innovative infrastructure to address those needs better than we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5540)|
| 1:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| All right, good. Is Chris here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Is that, Chris, I thought I saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| If y'all don't mind, would you go ahead and bring Chris down and introduce him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| I'd like, for those of y'all who may not know, Chris is the new Executive Director and President of the Knoxville Education Foundation, which is a newly formed organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5567)|
| 1:32:57| It's sort of where our Great Schools Partnership has made a big step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| Chris is new to Knoxville. He's recently been hired as the new leader of the program and is making leaps and bounds, and we're very, very lucky to have him in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5582)|
| 1:33:14| Chris, while this is before us, I want to give you an opportunity, just if you don't mind, to take a few minutes to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about yourself, your background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5594)|
| 1:33:24| and where you see taking, out of the context of this particular appropriation, but just tell us a little bit about where you see yourself helping take the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5604)|
| 1:33:33| Well, thank you, sir, and thank you, Commissioner, for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| I'm beyond thankful and humbled to have the opportunity to come to Knox County and serve young people and to serve them well with our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5616)|
| 1:33:45| I'm from Tampa, via New York. I spent 25 years with Boys and Girls Clubs and saw how unique this opportunity was to work with an incredible team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5625)|
| 1:33:55| Jonathan Sunover is here tonight, who's really led a lot of these conversations, along with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| And my family and I wanted to come to Knoxville so we can raise our kids and give back and contribute, so we're excited that our 7- and 3-year-old will be Knox County students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| and that we're thrilled that we can work towards providing equity and innovation for every single student who attends our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| So, thank you for your support. We're eager to get to work and really excited about taking this long range and making sure that every student who needs a hand up gets that from us as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5656)|
| 1:34:27| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was wondering, when you all set this program up, did you all, about the e-learning, did you all ever go to Campbell County where the Tennessee K-12 did the whole state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5671)|
| 1:34:45| and what their programs were like up there to get their information on how you could do online learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| That I do not know. I can follow back up with the Commission and with you in particular, specifically, and get a history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| That would be good because they've been doing it for a number of years for students all across the state. It's called a K-12, I guess, is the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| And they had the director that set the whole thing up that lives in that county up there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| No, I think we at the Foundation will make sure we do that and see what other models are out there across the region and the country to make sure we're being efficient and effective in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5713)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| All right. Thank you. Good question, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Okay. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Madam Clerk, who made the first and the second on this, just to restate for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| All right. That was Commissioner Gill made the motion with the second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Okay. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Item number 60, Ordinance O-20-7-102, is amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2, Section 42-58, entitled Competitive Tests, List of Eligibles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5748)|
| 1:36:03| and Section 42-59, entitled Filling of Vacancies, to establish timeframes for administering employment candidate examinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-111, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Motion to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Okay. All right. We have a motion from Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Baylor to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| All right. Are there any representatives from the Merit Council here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| So if you could please go ahead and state your name and address for the record and kind of tell us more about what you've brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5796)|
| 1:36:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Missionaries, my name is Paula Taylor. I'm the Director of the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Basically, this is an amendment to the ordinance because currently it does not establish any timeframes as to when these exams should be administered before placement of the eligibility list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5810)|
| 1:37:02| By changing the ordinance as it is presented, it would allow the Merit Council to continue administering the psychological and physical exams after selection by the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5822)|
| 1:37:13| which will save thousands of dollars in doing so by having them complete after they're selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| as opposed to having to administer those exams to all of the candidates prior to selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| Maintaining this process will also allow the Merit Council staff to ensure all candidates successfully complete each of these requirements in order to be covered under Merit System Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5846)|
| 1:37:38| and to maintain fair and equitable process under the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| It's not actually changing any of the current practices that we've already done or have been administered for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| It's merely presenting the change in the language of the ordinance that will allow the current process for us to continue ensuring these candidates are administered the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5869)|
| 1:37:59| and successfully complete each requirement established by the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| And, sir, if you could introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| I'm not that bright, but I'm assuming y'all are together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Thank you. Jim Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| I'm a 2004 Tazewell Pike, and I am chair of the North County Sheriff Employees Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5894)|
| 1:38:25| There's a lot of misunderstanding about, you know, the sheriff, the sheriff with a lot of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| but we represent the employees, and the Merit Council was established in 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| There have been a lot of changes, and so when the sheriff needs his changes, he has to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5919)|
| 1:38:48| We are appointed by this commission, and so when there is a change, this has been doing a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5928)|
| 1:39:01| and it's saved $100,000 a year by doing it the way that Director Taylor's doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| and I, for one, you know, like saving money, and somebody figured this out a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| but through our law director, and he said that we need to put the verbiage up with what we're doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5957)|
| 1:39:27| and he didn't see any problem with the changes, my understanding, so I won't take your time up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| The last time I was down there, I think, was battling for deputies with a pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| so I appreciate the work that you guys and ladies do, and thanks for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| I hope you'll support Ms. Taylor and the council on this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Okay, thank you. Is there anybody from the Sheriff's Department here? Sheriff Spangler here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| He was going to be out of town, so I think that's probably appropriate that any action is deferred until the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| Yeah, until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| So, all right, the motion on this one has been to send, if you are at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| the way this works, tonight's the work session, so this is one of those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| and also, to be blunt, we've done a lot of things at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| Next week, we've worked through enough so that I'm thinking next week's meeting, bar anything unforeseen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| there's not going to be that many. We'll have Commissioner Beeler's item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| and then we can dedicate some more focused time to considering this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| I don't know that that many commissioners know all the ins and outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| I know that you all are busy and have a lot to do, but we meet once a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| We're required once a quarter, and would be happy if it's publicly noticed, open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| and we do a lot of things, and it's about the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6054)|
| 1:41:03| When administrations change, when I was a young man, I've been in Knox County a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| and sheriffs change, but this stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| Long-time deputies were required to raise money to keep a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| You get a promotion if you can raise a certain amount of cash, and so that's what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6079)|
| 1:41:27| and that's my only interest, that we do the best we can to make sure that employees are taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6087)|
| 1:41:39| and not knocked politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| 1970's a long time, and there are minor changes in there sometimes, but for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6102)|
| 1:41:50| the sheriff brings stuff over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| If there's a change made, then he has to justify these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| and we had questions last month in table, and they had to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6117)|
| 1:42:05| It was about a chain of command issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| and we're like, yo, we get our agenda real late in the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| and you don't have time, a lot of times, to do the research that you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Speaking just for myself, this is one of those things I'm sure we'll probably want to do a little bit of research on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| and I'm sure that just to make sure everybody is more intimately familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| especially when there's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Well, I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| I don't know why I usually don't work for nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| but it is important to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| and I appreciate the opportunity to serve in this capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| and if the employees come tomorrow and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| we don't think you're doing a good job representing the merit council, I'd resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| But that's all it's about for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| We take the employees, and not in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| I'll be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| We're going to have to talk sometime about some financial compensation for our police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6182)|
| 1:43:10| and our construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| I understand that's a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| It's a different day, and we handled it last month pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| So, Mr. James, I do have to move on to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I guess this is a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| I was fortunate enough to meet with Paula and Jim Wright, Jr., and also talk to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| During all this conversation, I've learned a lot about the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| and I'm going to learn a lot more between now and next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| but I'm surprised that this commission does not have a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| that's probably a non-voting member that's a part of this merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| I guess the number one question is, law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| can we have a representative from this commission that can come back and help report this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6228)|
| 1:43:56| Well, the merit council is established by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| even though we incorporate the plan with the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| I imagine you could probably include one in an ordinance somehow, but the actual members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| the sheriff has a non-voting member, I think, isn't it, Jim, on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| And I don't know that there's a commissioner in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Basically, the role of the merit council is to provide a way for officers to have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| or a grievance to be heard in case there's a conflict between employment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| with the sheriff and the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| This particular item here, and I think it was well presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| is dealing with the process whereby qualified candidates are sent to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| In this particular thing, the current law requires them to send a fully qualified candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6284)|
| 1:44:51| which means we have to shift this psychological evaluations in the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| over a lot of candidates that may or may not ever be selected by the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| And what the proposed change is right now is that we send them over qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| except for certain elements, some of the field stuff and the psychological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| because they're so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| So if you make the first tier cut, it will allow them to go back and take their psychological.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| If they pass the psychological, then the sheriff can hire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| So it's really a good financial move, trying to clarify really what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| And so, you know, I'm not on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| I can't make a recommendation, but I think it was well brought that it's an efficiency and it saves money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| We're going to have to have the psychological somewhere front end or back end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| and to line up the ordinance with procedure is what this ordinance is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6345)|
| 1:45:54| Yeah, I'm all for saving money, and like I said, I spoke with Paula and Jim right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| I like the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| Since this is an ordinance, do we have to have a public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| Is this a two reads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| This is the first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| It's a two read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| It's not a budgetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| I think it's mainly public hearings for zoning related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| So we don't have to have a public hearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify with Law Director Armstrong is this is codifying normal practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| That's the way to put it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Well, I want to encourage, as I said in the forum, for all of my fellow commissioners to do some follow-up calls with the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6396)|
| 1:46:43| learn some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| It's also one of those, you know, it takes two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| So this is one of those things that, you know, we can act on it this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| and then there's still going to be, you know, it's a multi-month deal here to see any change to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| and our commission is changing, you know, as well as we begin to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| So everybody do your homework between now and Monday, and we'll see where they are on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| But I think the proper step on this one is to go ahead and pass the motion that's properly before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| send it forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| So if there's any follow-up questions on Monday, some extra insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| and then we can begin to make a plan to learn more and move forward on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| And who made the motion in the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200720?start=6451)|
