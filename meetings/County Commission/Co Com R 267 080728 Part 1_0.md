| 0:01:30| you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Our first applicant, the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| This is a deferred application for Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTM's 7712 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| on premises formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Would you please state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Thomas Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| And Mr. Pitner, this matter has been before the board on several occasions, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| that the last time we deferred it in order to get the information from the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| office, and I'd just like to provide that information to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| Mr. Pitner's application initially came in in February, where he changed his mind as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| to the type of business he intended to run out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Correct me if I'm wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| And reapplied in March of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| At that time, there were some representations made, and the law director's office was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| look into your lease agreement as well as some of the history, criminal history, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| some of the people that were involved in the business or appeared to be involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Yeah, just one gentleman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| And that individual was Matthew Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| For the board, the information that the law director's office went through was that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| the initial March meeting, Mr. Pitner testified that he leased the property, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| it was on the initial application, from an HP Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| We've looked through the documentation, and it appears as if he actually sublets the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| from a Matthew Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Matthew Taylor was the individual who testified at that particular time, and there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| question about his criminal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| And we were asking for documentation concerning your sublet, what you had sublet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Yes, they wanted a notarized copy of the lease, and we did provide that, I think, about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| meetings back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Well, they were looking at the document itself is really not legally sufficient that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| provided to us, and based on that, we also pulled, we got a release from Mr. Taylor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| pull his criminal history to see if he had any particular felony or anything within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| He does have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| He does have a felony, but it's not within the 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| And he has other matters that are involved in his criminal record, but nothing that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| in the last 10-year period that would preclude him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| However, the question really remains, as we were looking at the lease agreement, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| testified before the Board that you had leased from Mr. Oxendine, and apparently you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| You leased from Matt Taylor, who sublets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| I think I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| I live in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| When this property become available, I had Matt Taylor require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| In addition, for him taking care of this for me, I said, well, I'll just let you have $1,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| a month for taking care of that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| He is a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I had planned on him maybe picking up a few days there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| He's a full-time student now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| If there's a problem with him working there, I don't need him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| He can just be the landlord of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| And I did mention something the last time, and it slipped my mind until after I had spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| The gentleman that had a beer license in there, Greg Turner, before I went in there, he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| not have a written lease, a notarized lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| He had a verbal month-to-month lease, and he also had a beer license to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| Well, the thing the law department was looking at, the issue that was before them, was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| whether or not your representations to the beer board were accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| And that's what they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| That's why they wanted a copy of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| After about six trips, you may say things, and sometimes people can say things where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| people can twist them into other things also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Well, I had gone back through, and we pulled the tapes, and we looked at the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| that you submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| In the March meeting, you stated that you leased from H.P. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| That's who is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| And there was also testimony from Matthew Taylor, indicating that his involvement was solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| on the basis of being a bartender a couple of days a week and said that you could fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Based on that, that is the information that the law director's office has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I do not know if anybody has any questions for Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| I do, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| I spoke with Mr. Pitner earlier today, and Mr. Seymour has been retained by Mr. Pitner to help him with this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=359)|
| 0:06:08| I did not know that until just five minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| In light of that, we all have talked with Mr. Seymour many times up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I think it might be in this board's best interest to give this 30 days more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=379)|
| 0:06:29| Let us all have a chance, if we want to, to speak with Mr. Seymour in order that we make sure we get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| So I would like to make a motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| I will still perhaps be on this board at that time, and if so, I can assure you that within that 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| I will have what information this board needs to know about regarding Mr. Pitner's operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| Mr. Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Yes, sir. I want to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Yes, a second, but I'd like to ask Arthur a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I was going to ask him, too. Go ahead, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Okay, Arthur, go ahead. Fill us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| All right. The beer application itself, the piece of paper-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| Arthur, if you will identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Oh, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| Let's start back with the original paper application that is filed that initiates the application for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=453)|
| 0:07:43| That application asked who is the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Mr. Pitner put down Mr. Oxidine, whom I do not know, but he is the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| according to the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I went back and watched the videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| I started in January, but actually this first came up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| So I watched February, March, April, May, and June that dealt with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Fun weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| But he, I think, really misstated, if you go back and look at that March meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| what the property ownership situation was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| that Oxidine is the owner. Is it Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Taylor has apparently got a lease from Oxidine and is leasing it to Mr. Pitner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| Now, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| The beer laws say that the property owner doesn't have to have a clean record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| The property owner can be anybody, and I, sure, given a little time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| I can come up with a number of people in this town who have less than clean records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| who own property that may have an establishment that sells beer or liquor on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| I have not taken that trouble yet, but that's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| He cannot have anybody have an ownership interest in the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| or a work in the business who has been convicted, one, a violation of the beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=555)|
| 0:09:24| or the laws regulating the service of alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| or have anybody who has an interest in the business who has been convicted of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| or of a felony involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| Now, our Supreme Court has said, what is a felony involving moral turpitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| They've ruled out two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| There's a sort of funny Supreme Court case from about 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| They said rolling dice for Coca-Cola is not a crime involving moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and violation of the game and fish laws is not a crime involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Other than that, they said the lawmakers ought not to use the term moral turpitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| in the ordinance in any laws that they pass in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| because it's not otherwise defined in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Now, I think Mr. Pitner, in looking at the videos of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| was simply confused when the questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Oxidine is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| He addressed that squarely in the application, both applications that are filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| Taylor, he will be renting from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Taylor came to a couple of the meetings and testified, yes, he had a lease from Oxidine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| and he was in turn leasing it to Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Now, there is no requirement in the beer laws that you have a formal written lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| that a lawyer such as me would draw to lease the property from Oxidine to Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| and Taylor to Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| I can charge him a goodly sum of money to draw such a lease, and a lot of people do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| but if you look at a lot of the property arrangements around town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| they're on handshakes, they're on the back of pieces of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| I had one up in Sevier County a number of years that was written in two languages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| English and Farsi, that involved a lease of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| and the court really had fun trying to interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| But you can get into all sorts of situations where people don't have any kind of written lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| That's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| A lease of property under Tennessee law for more than one year is unenforceable in the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| unless there is, as the statute says, a memorandum in writing of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| It doesn't say it has to be a formal legal document such as you all see quite frequently here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| when Knox County is involved in legal deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| It just has to be a writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And a writing can be something like what Mr. Pitner and Mr. Taylor and Mr. Oxidine have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| It can be something scratched out on a legal pad here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| As long as it's signed by the parties, that's all that Tennessee law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| It doesn't require that it come off a lawyer's word processor or out of his form file or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| In looking at this, it appears to me that Mr. Pitner is entitled to a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| He has complied with all the requirements of state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| and the county regulations that regulate the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| If I have told him and I have told Mr. Taylor that as long as there's a question about whether or not Mr. Taylor has a conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| he cannot work in the place or have any ownership interest in the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| And he understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| I have not met Mr. Taylor, but I did have a phone conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Was it Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| And he understands that and Mr. Pitner understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Mr. Pitner understands the beer laws probably more than he did in March when he first appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| or February when he first appeared before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| but will certainly comply with the laws of the state of Tennessee and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| And I submit he is at this time respectfully entitled to a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This has been going on since February or January when you first came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I just wanted to make sure I understood where we were on a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| When you first came to us, there was an issue as to whether or not there would be nudity involved at the club or the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| and you had said, no, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| And so the second thing was Mr. Taylor's involvement with regards to how he was going to interface with your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| So how will Mr. Taylor be involved in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| How will he interact with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| He's going to interact with me as a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| If he cannot be there selling alcohol, he will not have any involvement in alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| If there is any problem with him working in the building whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| he will not be in the building in a working capacity other as a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| Now, as I understand the law director to say that this issue was over 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| So if it's over 10 years old, then that's not something that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Is that correct, law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| If it's 10 years old, if it's over 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| He does have a felony that's in excess of 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| But according to the law, if it's in excess of 10 years, is that a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| So that's not really something for us to consider if it's over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| It was questioned to me about the way I answered his question about a crime involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| And we had had servers training for myself, Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and some other people that would possibly be selling beer there at the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| And he had to provide a background check and stuff at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| And they did give him his server's card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| I'm ready to give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I mean, you've been here since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And the law director now, I think, has brought before us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And I respect my colleague asking for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| And if that's what the body wishes, I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| But whether it's next month or this month, I'm prepared to vote to give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And I know at one time that I've lost track of the meetings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| But it was either the third meeting we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Everybody seemed to be for it and ready to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| except there was a lady who had to speak on something that everyone sitting up there at that time said was probably a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| And we resolved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| And, as a matter of fact, we were just pretty much looking to get our beer license that next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| and then the issue with the lease and so on and so forth until we're here to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| And I had to get Arthur to give me some advice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| Commissioner Norman, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I just wanted to ask Mr. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I gave a second for the delay, but I really don't understand why we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| So I just wanted to ask him what's going on with him about the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| Mr. Pitner, I spoke with you and Mr. Seymour down here earlier before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Could you describe to this board what you explained to me about the attire that your employees are dressed in during your business hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1010)|
| 0:17:02| I've been asked before by the board, do you have any dancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Well, I do not have any nude type of dancing whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| My girls, if you've ever been to a Hooters restaurant, you're looking at about the same type of attire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:18| Are these uniforms that you furnish for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Actually, we have talked to a costume designer about actually creating us a uniform right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| but I've sort of put that on hold until we see what we do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| because I figured after I get beer I might even go as far as trying to get a food menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| and get with the health department and do some things like serving a little menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| and have it sort of like a sports type atmosphere in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Mr. Chairman, I want to make a statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| I leave this seat in two months, maybe one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| This perhaps could be my last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| and I want to be positive and 100% sure that whatever I turn over to my successor is clean and above reproach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:13| And that's one reason, Commissioner Norman, that I really feel strongly that in 30 days I will know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| I realize it's been going on a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| but I just haven't had the opportunity to dig a little deeper and to know what I found out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| I want to be sure that we're being told the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Tonya, is that all for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I know that it says in here that any knowing false statement made either in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| or in testimony before the beer board shall result in automatic revocation of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| In addition, any person making such false statements should not be eligible to receive a beer permit for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Now, I understand that Mr. Seymour said that there was some confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and I could understand how there could be some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| I understand that we all want to be a thorn in somebody's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| and if they've done everything that they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| that we want to make sure that they have an opportunity for making their business prosper, especially in these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| What I would like to maybe throw out to all of you to consider is in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| Tennessee Code Annotated says that the beer board may issue temporary beer permits for periods not to exceed 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| but the applicant for such a permit must meet the same requirements as necessary for a permanent permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| No temporary permit shall allow the sale of beer on publicly held property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| So maybe we should consider using a temporary beer permit for 29 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| and allow this gentleman to move forward and in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| On our part, since we don't know whether we're going to be sitting here or not, this would not thwart his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| It would allow him to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| It would also allow our successors, if they're going to be in our place next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| to follow up on this and have him come back and actually see what he's done in about a month's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I'm going to go along with my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| This is your district, and if that's what you want to do, I'm going to go along with your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| But even if you're not here next year, you can still speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, you can still come to this body and tell us what you've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| So not knowing what's going to happen, you can still come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Madam Law Director, I'm not familiar with the code that Commissioner DeVries just quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Which one are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| She was talking about a temporary beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's the first time I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| There is a provision for that in your beer code, in your beer board procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Madam Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I also would like to inform you that on the March 24th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| his application was approved pending review of the law director's office, the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| So there was actually a voting on this on the March 24th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| It's not an application that's not been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| But as part of the board, you do have the right, pursuant to our guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| to withdraw that, rescind it, or modify it in any way that you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Go ahead, UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| In the 17 years that I've been here, we have not used a temporary permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| It's not in our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| It is in the state TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But in our beer laws, the city of Knoxville has got a temporary to use around Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| We never did use that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Are they thinking, UK, they're more like special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Is that what you're talking about around Calhoun's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Ball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Ball games and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Yes, this question is to Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| I'm having a hard time understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| You said you need a month to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| But if they're not open, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| He's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Are you open now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| We're not selling beer, but we have been open since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| He's selling Coca-Cola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Potato chips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Have a pool table, a video game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| When I was by there a while back, there was a sign at bring your own bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| I was by there Saturday night, and there was about seven cars in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| He didn't have a beer license, and I didn't go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| But, yes, he's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| He's never denied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| He's said that in three or four previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question for the beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| UK, just because Knox County has never utilized a temporary beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:26| what would be wrong with testing the waters and doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| And I'd like to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Commissioner, I don't have a problem with it if you all want to bring it up and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| The beer laws that we've got out, the beer board met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| and went over the beer laws that you'd use in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and that's what we've been going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=1431)|

| 0:34:07| Eighteen commissioners are present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:37| Before we get started on our devotion and pledge of allegiance to the flag, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| to have a short moment of silence for the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| I think we all know what happened yesterday, a sad event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Would you like to say anything, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Harmon, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| I just would like to thank this community on behalf of my congregation and remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| that a lot of healing will come in the next few days and months, and we'll need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| Hate entered our house of worship, but hate will not last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| The good people there will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I just hope that in whatever coverage we give of this today and in the near future, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| spend too much time on those who hate, but on the heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Robert Birdwell, Jamie Parkey, John Bostat, Greg McKendry especially, Brian Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| These people took children to safety, tackled a gunman, or in one case, took some shots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| that may have wiped out a row in which I was sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| They are all heroes, and I hope our concentration is on them as we do our moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2153)|
| 0:36:06| Our devotion today will be led by Commissioner Victoria DeFries and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag by Commissioner Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:16| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Yes, for the devotional today, I have invited Dr. Gary Weedman, who is the current president of Johnson Bible College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| So, Dr. Weedman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| I'm pleased to be here today in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Before today, all I knew about the Knox County Commission was what I read in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| I'm happy to see you firsthand, and I looked at your webpage today to find out more about what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| I saw an awesome agenda you have today, so I know my job is to be here and be gone in a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| I still don't know exactly what you do, but I do know that you are ambassadors for the citizens of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:08| And in some way, I suppose we all serve as ambassadors of one group or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| A few years ago, I learned a little bit about what it means to be an ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I, for the past 25 years or so, have traveled in Eastern Europe and for a time lived and worked there in Eastern Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| And before the fall of communism, I was going from Romania to Hungary, and I was detained for about 14 hours at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| It was a very difficult crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Before I left, I had, through the intervention of a U.S. senator, had a meeting with our U.S. ambassador to Romania at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:46| And when I left, he gave me his card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I finally got across the border into Hungary and found a straight and smooth road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| It was late. I was late for an appointment, and I was driving too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| I came into a village, and I jerked awake as I saw a man waving frantically with white sleeves on his arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| And I whizzed by him as he ran with his partner to their police car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| I knew I was in trouble if I didn't get back to where he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| So I made a fast U-turn, went back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| He marched over, quite irritated at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I handed him my car papers, my visa, and my passport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| He was rustling through them, chattering away in Hungarian at me, handed his partner my passport, and out fell Ambassador Green's card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:41| He picked it up and said to his angry partner, Ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And the man said, Ambassador?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| And he snapped to attention and saluted and put all my papers together and bowed and handed them to me and motioned for me to be on my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:59| And I was on my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| After I left, I realized I hadn't said one word during that whole encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| But then I realized I was an ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Not the kind he thought, but I was an ambassador for a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| And you are ambassadors, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And I know that you know that, and you act in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| In the Old Testament, it was Israel that was an ambassador of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| In whatever circumstances, Israel was not always treated with the deference that our ambassadors are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| In fact, Israel, as we know, was taken into captivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| But even when in captivity, Israel was told by one of her prophets to seek the peace and the prosperity of the city to which I have carried you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:54| Wherever you find yourself, this ambassador was told, seek the peace and the prosperity of the people around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| I think the classic advice to ambassadors is from another Old Testament prophet, this time Micah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| And Micah asks again of Israel, what does the Lord require of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| And then he answers his own question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| To act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| To act justly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| To treat those people who are in the lower parts of society with respect and with justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:39| In the first five chapters of the prophecy of Micah, he addresses the injustice done to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| Physical abuse, illegal confiscation of property, treating people inhumanely for financial benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:57| Our task in Knoxville is to find those people on the outskirts of our society and to make sure that they are treated justly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| To love mercy, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| The Hebrew word is hesed, and it describes a character of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| To love people even when they are unlovable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| To make a commitment to them that is irrevocable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| That's how God treats his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| And then to walk humbly with God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| I'm not sure how else we can walk with God other than humbly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| If we have a sense of his constant presence with us, we walk humbly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Someone has defined character as what one does when no one is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| We know that God is always watching and always with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I don't know a lot about your work, but I do know that you are ambassadors for our citizens in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| And as with any ambassador, your job is to seek the peace and the prosperity of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| To act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| Our hearts indeed do go out to those brave people who did act against evil yesterday at the Unitarian Universalist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:29| And our hearts indeed and our prayers on our campus have gone out for those who have been so tragically affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| And I want to pray for them and for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Sovereign God, of all the peoples of this earth, you have blessed us with an abundance that a majority of this earth's inhabitants could not even dream about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| And for this undeserved blessing, we give you thanks and accept the responsibility of being good stewards of what you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| I thank you for these men and women who have dedicated themselves to be ambassadors for the citizens of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| And I pray for them in their every deliberation and decision that they will reflect your character and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| We do lift up, O Lord, these brave people who acted in the face of evil and hatred so courageously and lovingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| extending your own loving kindness to those about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| And we pray at this time that they will find your own peace in their lives and in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:38| I ask all of this in your holy name and to your eternal glory. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:56| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:19| I have a quick announcement for the people in this audience and also on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080728-part-1?start=2659)|
