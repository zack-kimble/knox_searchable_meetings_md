| 0:01:11| Sorry. Oh, here you go. Sorry. I was wondering if we can move public forum before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| discussion. I don't see why not. That's fine with me. So is everybody cool with moving public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| up before the discussion? Okay. Let's move public forum up to number three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| number after number three. So I need a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=89)|

| 0:01:50| the last couple weeks. I had COVID. I want to thank Commissioner Smith for running the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| ship while I was gone. I also would like to address real quickly, I have added what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| being called 3B, further redistricting plan. We got a letter, an open letter from the NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| and we had a lot of people reach out to us from the first district and I thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| appropriate that we at least try to find a solution to have a minority majority plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| So I was able to talk to planning the next day and we found a solution which is bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| forward as 3B so we at least have one option on the table for everybody tonight for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| that has a minority majority and actually increases the amount of minority majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| there is from what is currently in first district. So just so everybody is aware of that, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| is public speaking, that that plan is one of the plans that we're going to be reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| tonight. So we have to approve the agenda for tonight, don't we? Just a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=171)|
| 0:03:05| the agenda? Motion to approve. Second? All in favor? Aye. Thank you. I'm going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| to public forum with somebody that has anything to say. Mr. Jay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| You referenced an open letter? Yes, sir. Is that a, were we sent a copy of that? I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| not sent a copy, I was made aware of it. I've never received it. So you may have a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| of what you're referring to? I was not, I've not received the letter, it was just made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| aware to me and I saw it on the media and the news and that's all I have. Okay, so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| no letter? I've asked for one, I haven't seen it yet. Unless somebody has a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| it tonight. Okay. He's got the copy? Thank you, sir. Can you bring it up so we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=225)|
| 0:03:58| it part of the record, sir? I'll submit that as part of the record for tonight, the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=238)|
| 0:04:12| from the NAACP. Do we have any other questions before we move on to public forum? Okay. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| first on my list for public forum is Jay Schmid. Mr. Schmid? Sir, I need your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=258)|

| 0:05:03| Sequoia Bearden area, and I was hoping that Sam McKenzie was going to be here first, but I'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| ahead and speak. I'm involved with the Kingston Black Sequoia Hills Association, which is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| voluntary neighborhood association, and I just wanted to say that we sent a letter in, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=319)|
| 0:05:29| it's hopefully to all the commissioners you receive that and be part of the record, but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| got a print copy if you'd like to... Can you give it to the clerk when you're done, sir, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| make it part of the record as well. Okay, thank you. I just wanted to say that we had seen the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=337)|

| 0:05:52| ideas that we would like Sequoia to hopefully remain in the fourth district and that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=352)|
| 0:06:04| not really be in favor of the idea to dilute the minority majority part of the current first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=364)|
| 0:06:15| district for county commissioners and school board. We've always been the West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| community and we think it should remain that way. So that's really all. I'll be happy to give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| to the clerk to put for the record. Yes, sir. Thank you. Be careful of the cords, sir. Next on my list is Sam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=389)|

| 0:11:31| to serve your community. First and foremost, let me say that I've lived in seven states. I've viewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| the political process since I was 18 years old on a number of different levels. Since moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=699)|

| 0:17:38| key to protecting our community's interest and also making sure that the commission like Norwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1058)|

| 0:18:58| keep this district 70 W in the present district that it's in. And I believe on your map that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| probably include keeping us in five, but it's been a while since I've seen the map. But so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1147)|

| 0:27:23| their plans or edit them? Mr. Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Because we took Plan 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| and then with the support of the 6th District, the 1st District, and the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| we modified it to 3A. So I'd like to withdraw Plan 3 then from consideration. But if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1657)|
| 0:27:46| there's no interest in considering 3A, then I guess really it would be, I need to hear some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1666)|
| 0:27:58| input from the other commissioners who altered 3 to 3A if they want to go ahead and pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| Do the other commissioners, Commissioner Lundy and Commissioner Durrett, are you also okay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker retracting 3A? I'm okay with it. Thank you. Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| If that's what you... Commissioner Hill? She was involved in that as well. Are you also okay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| that? Okay, then we'll pull Plan... I'm sorry, did you have a question? I'm just trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| out which ones have been withdrawn. Okay, three. One has been withdrawn, three has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And then now I'll make a... I'll move that we withdraw 3A then from consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| So currently I have Proposal Number 5 and Proposal Number 3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1722)|
| 0:29:07| I believe 4 is still in play. We haven't taken 4 off the boards. We have those three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1747)|
| 0:29:17| Is everybody okay with that? On the same page with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| So for voting, we're going to do ranked voting. Mr. Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| Help me understand how... I think our concern from one of our audience members is valid, that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1769)|
| 0:29:38| a deadline so we had time to consider it. But the last one is we haven't really had time to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| it and we're going to move right into voting. So how does that... how did we get to that and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1784)|
| 0:29:52| does it go forward if we're changing the rules midstream? Sure. Would you like to request a delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| in the vote? I'm just asking for some clarification and just... Sure. I think I explained a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| earlier why I submitted one more plan. I have not been here and then out of the outreach from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| first district, I think it was only right for our minority community that we try to do the best job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| by them by finding a minority majority map that would work. I was up to three o'clock in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| morning on Monday or Tuesday morning, I guess it was, and then I spent, what, two hours, three hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| with you guys and planning, trying to find a solution there. So this, I think to the fairness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| all our citizens, I wanted to submit this. That's why it's late because I have not been around. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| been out for three weeks. But if you would like to request a delay in the vote, I would hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| that and see what the rest of the commissioners feel about it. Well, I think it's... I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| how I feel about that in particular. I guess one of the questions I would just have us relate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| specifically to 3B, and again, I don't have a lot of time to process it, but I think one of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| goals of this committee was to move as few people as possible. Sure. And this is who moves the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| people as possible. So how does it coincide with one of the goals of this committee? If you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| want to vote for that plan that's minority majority, you do not have to vote for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| That's your call, sir. So I can't force you to vote for that plan. There are two other options you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| can vote for, but I thought this would be the best solution to what I thought would serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| most people in the county. But this commission, this committee, has 11, 12, 13 voters, so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| not vote for it, sir, if you don't want to. Do I have any other questions before we start voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| or does anybody want to delay the vote? Commissioner Skinner. Well, I was just going to say maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| if we could kind of move the order a little bit. In other words, plan number four is the oldest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| and the author of that plan is not here tonight. So I guess, you know, should we go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| consider four first being the oldest, and then go to five, and then go back to 3B? My plan was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| vote, and then whatever the lowest voting would drop off, and then we'd vote again. Just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| we do for... Yeah, just like when we nominate people and such. So just so I clarify for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| audience and for all the commissioners, we're going to do a roll call vote. The two maps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| get the highest two votes will stay. The bottom third, the third one, will drop off. We'll then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| do another roll call vote for the top two, and whichever one from the top two will be forwarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| on to commission, so the audience is aware this is not the final. This goes then to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| Commission then has the choice if they want to edit that map. They could in theory, but it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| be then two more votes to then pass it. So after this, it would go to commission, and then after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| it would be two votes at commission, so two separate votes for it to be passed on and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| sent to be official. Could I... Yes, ma'am. Thank you. And I appreciate your order in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1978)|
| 0:33:11| in the elimination. I would kind of like to hear from our commission 1 and 2 representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=1991)|
| 0:33:23| their plan as opposed to the 3B plan, and how you... What is your take on this now that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| heard from some of your residents, as well as for my first time today hearing from some of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| through email, and the two of you that showed up to speak, I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| Commissioner Lundy or Commissioner Durrett, which one of you would like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. 3B, so our proposal, again, the main goal was to make that minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| majority a possibility. Currently, it is a minority majority by four people, so it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2042)|
| 0:34:11| incredibly hard task to try to complete. As you can see in proposal 5 and ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2051)|
| 0:34:21| we didn't necessarily get it to a minority majority. We got it as close as we thought we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2061)|
| 0:34:31| and also in taking into consideration some other proposals, like Commissioner Hill, yours from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| District 1, this is... District 6 is how it was for your proposal. Excuse me, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| From your proposal, it stayed the same. We also took into consideration where schools were located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| We took into consideration all the comments that have been made previously by other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| and that sort of thing. So, I mean, I cannot dispute the fact that 3B does actually create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2100)|
| 0:35:10| a minority majority. I understand the issue, however, of splitting up the Oakwood-Lincoln| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2110)|
| 0:35:20| Park neighborhood as far as one being in District 2 and one being in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| So, I'm still kind of mulling that over a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| And I agree with Commissioner Durick. Yes, it's very difficult. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| Town Hall East and know how involved they are in pushing District 1 forward. I have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| David Lee for a long time, very... Contributes a lot to District 1, and then I know Deborah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2149)|
| 0:36:01| from District 2, and that's something, you know, when I looked at the map of 3B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| I was worried about splitting that neighborhood, you know, and I should be for 3B because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| been fussing the whole time where I need my minority. But it just makes it really difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| honestly, you know, because I want to think about everybody else, too. I know the whole issue came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| from 24Q being added to District 1, and it seemed like everybody was just pretty disturbed about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| that. So, I know 24Q should not be in Sequoia Hills. I mean, honestly, I'm in a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2195)|
| 0:36:46| District, I mean, Solution 5 moves less people, and it seems like it gives communities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| staying together, and people are staying where they want to be for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| 3B does split a community, and then it takes away one of my active precincts, Precinct 31. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2220)|
| 0:37:12| how do I choose? Is it more important for me to have more minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| or keep neighborhoods together? And I'm really frustrated because sometimes I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2240)|
| 0:37:29| I feel like we forget that we are here to serve humans, people, and I wish we didn't have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2249)|
| 0:37:39| through this Democratic, Republican, black and white stuff. But the reason why we have policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| in place, like the NAACP pointed out, is because people continue to be treated unfairly and voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| not being heard. Whatever happens today, I hope we move forward. I hope that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| can get past this and still work together as a community, regardless of how we vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| Whatever happens, I'm just going to go with the flow. I love serving people, regardless of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| color, or regardless of their political party. And I'm just going to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Are there any questions or comments before we go to voting tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| I have to say I have a lot of heartburn on this because my constituents are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| And initially, people asked and I said I would surrender that precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2315)|
| 0:38:48| but it was in the interest of helping the east side and your numbers because I knew I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| to have to lose something. So, Daisha, I feel your frustration very, very much in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2334)|
| 0:39:05| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I'd like to hear from, I mean, District 8 changes considerably, District 3. I mean, I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2349)|
| 0:39:18| I'd like to hear from the other commissioners that are either going to lose or add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| because as it relates to neighborhoods, if they're willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| Would you like to go first, Mr. Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, obviously, District 8, it looks like in every proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| that's before us, District 8 loses precincts 77 and 78 to the 9th. And this is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| I've known this from the beginning. Look, the 9th definitely has to gain people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And if you look at the areas that are adjacent to the 9th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| all of them are across the river in some form or another. The 77th and 78 probably have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| similarity to the 9th District demographically than any other adjacent precincts. If you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| at the 87th, Thorn Grove, you can't move it into the 9th because they would have no access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2401)|

| 0:40:10| District because there's no bridge there. So I've known from the beginning that 77 and 78| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| would probably have to leave the 8th. I guess if I look at, as I look at solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| 4, which I don't have in front of me, but I see it, Commissioner Jay has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| My problem with solution 4 is it further elongates what's already a massive district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| in District 8 because now you would be going from Thorn Grove all the way to I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2436)|
| 0:40:45| It already goes to Norris Freeway and it would be going into yet another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| another high school zone, going all the way to I-75. So that bothers me in solution 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2450)|
| 0:40:59| That's not the only thing. And then in solution 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| I like a lot of elements of solution 5. I agree with Commissioner Lundy that solution 5 does seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| to keep communities together. However, that's not always going to be an achievable goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| in redistricting. And one of the problems I have with this solution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| District 6 remains one of the three largest districts. And if we pass a solution where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| District 6 is among the two or three largest districts, we're going to be moving a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| people in 10 years than we're moving this time because that is a fast-growing district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| So I wish there were a way that 31 could remain in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| It's 2,000 people and I know that might upset the majority-minority numbers a little bit. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2511)|
| 0:42:00| haven't looked at what the demographic is in precinct 31. I guess it's in front of me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| It's obviously only, is that 30%? I don't see very well. I'm sorry. 30% minority. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| if we're looking at the black community, if I'm not mistaken, there's a larger percentage in 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| than maybe in 18 or we put 18? Okay, no, I'm incorrect. So yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2543)|
| 0:42:37| I mean, I understand what the gentleman's saying though. It's a city precinct, definitely is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| important precinct in District 1. So I wish there were a way it could stay. And then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| the 17-18 thing is not ideal either. In the end, this is redistricting. This is about numbers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2568)|
| 0:42:57| if we don't do this, somebody's going to do it for us. Commissioner Smith, would you like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| any comments? Yes, Mr. Chair, thank you. As I said in the very beginning, this process is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| very difficult process because it's like dominoes. With all the growth out west and low growth in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| east and the south, you have to find your way to the growth to make the numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| And for District 3, a district I've lived in pretty much my whole life, even as the district's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| changed in its geographic shape, I've seemed to have moved with it. District 3 will be losing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2608)|
| 0:43:38| in most of these plans, if not all of them, Norwood and West Haven. Norwood's a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| that's been split, was split last time around, the north and south Norwood. West Haven is split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| Those are city districts, city precincts, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| In the plans that I see that bring in 70 west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| I feel it gives a balance to the third district in taking in some more county residents and less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| city residents. I think one of the problems we have when we sit on county commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| we tend to think of our city residents are different, but we represent all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| It's county-wide. City has priorities, county has priorities, and when you sit on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| you're there for the residents, whether they're the city or the county, for their county position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| So I think it's a good ideal to bring in some city actual residents into the eighth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| I think it's a good ideal to have some of these districts that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and the way we're set up, one and two, it's going to be very hard to ever get much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| county reach into the residents. You know, this is tough. We've had people come here and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| you know, don't move me, because people have to move. And unfortunately, 3B does move the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| most people. It moves, I think, pretty close to exactly the number of people we grew by in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| last decade. But it does something very, very important, and it keeps that minority majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| And I think that's a very important thing, both legally, politically, and culturally. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| like I said, this is a tough process. We have to do it every 10 years. Nobody here is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| to leave here completely happy. Thank you. Are there any other comments from any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| commissioners? Commissioner Hill. What it looks like we've come down to on these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| forgive me for assuming, I'm not addressing Plan 4. I'm talking about 3B and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| Excuse me. What it comes down to is looking like the advantage of 3B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2757)|
| 0:46:10| at least for our larger districts, is that it does size it down considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| And that is, in 5 and 6 both, that is an issue that we have to look at, and it does protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| the minority district advantages. The real disadvantage is it divides neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2784)|
| 0:46:37| in three districts. Do I understand our charge is the size and the minority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2797)|
| 0:46:48| And that makes me sick to say because I'm one that's going to be hit with a divided neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| If that happens to be the one that passes. So I'm just talking out loud, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| Do I have any other comments? Commissioner Durrett, please. Mr. Davis, would you care to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| offer up what it would look like with a divided neighborhood being one, it's a cohesive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| neighborhood, but they are in two different districts. What does that look like when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| voting day, election day comes? You're going to have to be a little more specific in terms of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| give me a... Oakwood-Lincoln Park. Let's say Lincoln Park, it will become District 1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Oakwood is District 2. Well, from a voting perspective, Precinct 17 is a standalone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| precinct, and Precinct 18 is a standalone precinct, and granted they're only about a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| away, give or take, as the crow flies. From a strictly administrative perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| I don't see that being a big hindrance. I'm certainly not minimizing anybody's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| I just want to be clear, as I currently see it, the administration of the election I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| would be an issue for that particular, for those particular two precincts or one precinct if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| asking about 18. Do voting locations change or anything like that? I would not anticipate it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Would it be like that? Go ahead. I may know some, there may be something that comes up in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| don't hold me to that, but as I currently understand things, no. Certainly not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| I wouldn't advocate for that, and I see no reason to, frankly. And I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| just as a general rule, I've told a lot of people this, at some point after this, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2906)|

| 0:48:41| as I say this, and I'm going to recommend in consultation with NPC some changes to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| precincts to split some up. That does not necessarily mean I'm going to change voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| precincts. That is something that I don't enjoy doing. We did that in 2016 with a number of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| particularly, where is Commissioner Schoonmaker? He's up here somewhere. I heard from quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2934)|

| 0:49:09| happen, but I think that splitting up a neighborhood, frankly, I think it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| depend on the actual neighborhood you split up, maybe, and where those are impacted. One place I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| could possibly see that being an issue is maybe 40-41, depending on, currently 40 and 41 are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2961)|

| 0:49:37| the election, we're used to doing that anyway, because I think currently one of them is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| third and one of them is in the sixth, if memory serves. That's correct. Okay, and so maybe we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| moving them instead to one and two, if you follow a certain plan, for instance. It's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| voters are used to going in there and having to look for one of two different ballots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| so we're going to work with our workers as we always do to train them as such. However, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| where your confusion is going to lie is they're going to be used to maybe seeing so and so on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| ballot, and they don't see so and so on the ballot. We run into that frequently. We run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| that when we're not doing redistricting, that we have a voter who, in fact, I will tell you just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3009)|

| 0:50:26| district. They were angry with me. I had to pull out a map and explain to them you're 150 yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| from the boundary, so that stuff's going to happen, but from the administration of the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| you know, it's going to depend on precinct by precinct, but I don't see anything that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| from an administrative perspective, that bothers me with those. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| Yes. Commissioner Hill. So, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3045)|

| 0:51:45| maybe Beard Middle has precincts 45 and 55. It may not be in either one of those precincts. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| may be right on the line there as an example, but when I'm looking at a place like 70 W,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| that is the type of place, given the large number of voters, that we may end up having to move some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| voters from one polling place to another polling place, and of course, my big challenge is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| to be finding a polling place. It's that type of thing, so no guarantees, but you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3124)|

| 0:52:14| Let me just clarify one real thing real quick. I do have one of my bosses in the crowd, so I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| to say that ultimately the election commission would be making that decision. I would just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| making the recommendations. I'll leave it there. Do I have any questions or comments from any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| other commissioners? I'm not seeing any. We'll start the vote, so the three options that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| will have are 4, 5, and 3B will be the three options that you have, and we'll do a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3156)|
| 0:52:45| vote, and the top two will move on to the next round. We will then do another roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| and the winning one will go to commission, and then commission will vote on it in the coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3171)|

| 0:55:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| For 3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3322)|

| 0:55:44| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| I believe if one received a majority of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Is it not to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| I thought we were going to do the lowest vote receiving would fall off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| and then we would go down to the top two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Considering that one didn't get voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3365)|
| 0:56:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| If you were doing it the same way that you were doing elections in front of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| then if one commissioner gets a majority out of three votes or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| then you don't have to go back and do it all over again because that majority has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| I don't recall what the majority is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| I guess it's 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| So 7-4 would, that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| so because it's 7-4, that would be the majority, so it moved forward automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| So from the law director's advice, it's 7-4 right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| so it has the majority to move forward to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Does anybody want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Have you called for the final vote yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| That's what I'm asking for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Does anybody want to change their votes or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| The vote is 7-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| This is very confusing because you did say we were doing a process of elimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| Let's do one more round then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Mr. Chairman, I thought we would probably take at least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Are we just going to take one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| If we're taking one, yeah, I'll change my mind to 3-B, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Let's do the second round since I said we're going to do two rounds anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| So let's do it right and let's go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| this round you have option 5 and option 3-B are the two you can pick from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So we'll do one more roll call vote and 3-B and 5 will be this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| So that will be the only one that goes to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| So 4 dropped off of the last voting and whichever one comes out of this voting will go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| So your two options are option 5 and option 3-B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| and whichever one gets the most will go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| So the actual commission on, vote on commission will just be yay or nay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| No, we can work on it at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| This is just a recommendation from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| So once it goes to commission, we can work on it at commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| With only one option in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Well, we could take whichever one, 5 or 3 would win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| this one would go to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| then at commission we could adjust it further if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| You mean adjust the one map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Adjust the one map, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| You can create a holding proposal if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| This is just a recommendation from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I believe when this goes to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| we will refer to it as whatever solution it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| and then we will make amendments to it if we wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| Is everybody clear or does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So we're going to do one more roll call vote between 3-B and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Whichever one has the most votes will go to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and then at commission we can adjust further if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| I will now start in the second commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211006-redistricting?start=3542)|
