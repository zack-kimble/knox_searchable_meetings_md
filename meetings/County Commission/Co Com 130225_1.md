| 2:52:24| There's been a couple of folks who have said that there would be a random, you know, look at our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| And what I've proposed to the Board of Education and what they've authorized us to move forward on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| is actually more than just a random look at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| What they have, what I propose is a two-phased approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| The first phase, which would be a random selection of 27 schools that would actually include Powell Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| and Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| And for the contractor, who's a very well-respected contractor with great expertise, Simplex Cornell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10371)|
| 2:52:58| to look at three things, to look at our video, excuse me, to start with, our security alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| They would conduct an inspection of each of the security alarm system panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| and the components in each of our alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10390)|
| 2:53:13| They would do, in terms of video camera systems, Simplex Cornell would inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10393)|
| 2:53:17| and assess the video monitoring systems in each of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| They would assess the functionality of each camera and each video recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10399)|
| 2:53:23| and that would include an evaluation of the focus, point of view, and mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| That's the pan, tilt, zoom functionality were available for each camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| And then third, they would inspect and test each of our keypad or proximity card readers for our keyless entry systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10412)|
| 2:53:39| They would start with 27 schools randomly selected over the next month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| between now and when the TCAP window begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| They have to do it at night on weekends because when you inspect the security panel and components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| you actually set off the alarm, and so you can't be doing it during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| So they do 27 schools over the next several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| and then the board has authorized us to do the other 61 schools over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10437)|
| 2:54:05| I think there's an opportunity for us to, because Simplex Cornell is our current contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10445)|
| 2:54:10| and because inspection and tests of systems are in their contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| it gives us an opportunity to do, in a very short time frame, 27 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| And I guess I would say, let's do that, and let's see what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| and let's see if there are any issues that are identified through that first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| And if there are, I think that's an opportunity to have another conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| But the Board of Education has not said we should stop at a randomly selected 27 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| They said, let's do all 88 of our schools and look at those three components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| the security alarm systems, the video camera systems, and the keyless entry systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| and do an inspection, review, and test of all of those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| And that's what Simplex Cornell is prepared to do, and they're prepared to do it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| And I think that was, yeah, that's where I wanted to reassure you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10494)|
| 2:55:01| Okay, thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10501)|
| 2:55:02| Hold on, don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| Ms. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| I don't have any questions for you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| You can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| What I do have to say addresses some of us up here and some people who are out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10512)|
| 2:55:20| Something I want us all to remember is that Dr. McIntyre has children in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10520)|
| 2:55:27| Several members of the school board have children in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| And I think we need to be very careful about accusations we're leveling about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| whether or not they are really taking the safety and security of our children seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10535)|
| 2:55:41| because you're addressing them not only as public servants, but also you're talking about them as parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| And, Tony, that would be like somebody saying that you weren't taking the protection of our waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10548)|
| 2:55:53| and ridgetops seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| So I think we all need to be careful about how we're addressing each other with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| I have children in the public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| I don't give a damn about lawsuits or about public perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| All I care about is the safety of my children when they're at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| Now, I know that, of course, the school board is being excessively defensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| Tony, you would be excessively defensive if they were challenging you about something that's near and dear to your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10579)|
| 2:56:27| I'm really and I'm very irritated with people making sweeping statements like a gunman walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| Now, I've been a victim in a mass shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| I've been targeted for my political and religious beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| And I'm telling you, unless you've got a metal detector in the doorway, a gunman can walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10600)|
| 2:56:50| A camera is not going to stop that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| And from the shootings we've had at our schools, the one that happened at Inskip in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10613)|
| 2:56:58| was a teacher who went out and got a gun and came back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| No camera focused at a door was going to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| So I am getting really irate at the individuals who are trying to score political points for their side over an issue as important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10627)|
| 2:57:18| and should be as important to everyone else as our children's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| So let's get off the publicity, pointing fingers, scoring political points for what you think is best for your side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10642)|
| 2:57:31| and get down to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| I'm over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| Now, when is this meeting taking place tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| Is it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10658)|
| 2:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| I would like to know where and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| I know it's not sunshine, but you better believe I'm going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10666)|
| 2:57:59| It's the meeting that I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| And what I have said to the press when I've been asked that question, my priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10681)|
| 2:58:08| what I want to happen is I want these people at the table to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10688)|
| 2:58:14| I have no problem with the press being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| It does not have to be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| There are no two members of any one body together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| So I have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| But if it will hinder discussion at the table, and if there is anybody at that table that objects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| my priority is to have these people talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| I'm not there to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| I'm there to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| No, but my understanding is it does not have to be an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| Well, like I said, I know that school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| and our superintendent have children in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| Ed has a child in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| I have children in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10735)|
| 2:58:58| And I'm confident that they're doing what they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| When they say it's their number one priority, I believe them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| And this is someone who has been on a security kick at Vine Middle School for this entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10747)|
| 2:59:16| So I just want people to focus on what's important and stop trying to score points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10756)|
| 2:59:21| and stop trying to, as Karen said, cover their own butts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10761)|
| 2:59:26| Let's get busy and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Well, I'd like to take a little tension out of the air if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| You know, at the beginning I turned my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| And what I wanted to reiterate was the people that are looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10782)|
| 2:59:47| And we as commissioners have to respond to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| But meetings have been had between the sheriff and the chief and the mayor and Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10792)|
| 2:59:59| And all those things have already taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| There has been some discussion on which route do we go, what officers go where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| and who's going to deploy what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| But, you know, we're making this as much as a public issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| And we're creating this animosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| Everybody, you know, it was handled bad from day one, PR-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10819)|
| 3:00:24| And so everybody went on defense, started pointing fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| Let's just let, you know, like Karen said, there are separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| And I asked last week that we, and Dr. McIntyre and I have already begun our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| about reevaluating the school security division from top to bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| to make sure that we're using best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| and make sure that we're doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| and make sure that we've got an environment of total security at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10849)|
| 3:00:55| We've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| But this type of debate right here is not going to solve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10857)|
| 3:01:01| We're sitting up here bantering for attention and we're doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| There's experts locally and there's experts nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| that have already begun to handle the discussion on where we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| It's not like nothing has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| We've just decided to get in a circle and point fingers at everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| And until we can sit down at a table with no animosity between anybody sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| which has already taken place to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| and, you know, tomorrow's meeting already has tension from this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10890)|
| 3:01:34| And so let the process work itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| Changes have already been made in deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| Things have already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| And we're, in the law enforcement community, are keenly aware of what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10902)|
| 3:01:47| And we're trying to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| And it's not going to happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| It's going to be expensive at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| And so let's just, this animosity and finger pointing, we're not going to accomplish anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10912)|
| 3:01:58| because all we're going to do is point the finger and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| look what I did or look what they didn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| So let's just take a minute, breathe, and let things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10924)|
| 3:02:09| Because progress is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| It's just not as public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| Security issues can't be made as public as we'd like for them to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| You know, the parent from Coryton Elementary, you know, there's deficiencies at that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10938)|
| 3:02:24| She pointed them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| So now they're more public than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| And so we're defeating our own purpose by being so outwardly antagonistic about this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| I wish we as a commission would just offer a helping hand instead of being part of the finger pointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10955)|
| 3:02:44| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| I second what Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| I totally agree that we need to let the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10974)|
| 3:02:57| And I, for one, I'm hoping that tomorrow's meeting is not public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10977)|
| 3:03:01| I would hope that no two commissioners, no two board members would show up for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| Because they've got work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| And if we've got a representative in that meeting, we're going to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10988)|
| 3:03:12| I mean, you know, in this day and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| But there's sometimes you've got to roll up your sleeves and have a heart-to-heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| And I hope everyone in that meeting leave their feelings at the door and have a frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| honest discussion about what the problem is and move forward from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| So I, for one, if that doesn't happen, if the press shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| it immediately is going to go into what Commissioner Anders is urging us or urging you all to move away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11012)|
| 3:03:43| So, you know, but with that said, I do like the fact that we've had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11023)|
| 3:03:49| So thank you, Ms. Hammond, for having this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| Because it is, we have to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| And I know we've gotten, you know, no less than, you know, dozens of questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11035)|
| 3:04:01| I mean, it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| And coming on the heels of Connecticut shooting, it should be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| So, you know, if that's why we're elected here, that's why you all are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11047)|
| 3:04:15| compensated to deal with these big issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| But I want to talk about one sliver of this that I heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11057)|
| 3:04:23| Again, I'm not, you know, I do agree they're different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| But, Dale, could you help me understand what you said about the bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11068)|
| 3:04:39| Could you go over that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| Are you indicating, was this piece pulled out of the bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11080)|
| 3:04:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11088)|
| 3:04:49| That's what I thought you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| I think I need to clarify a little farther because there are a few folks out there that make accusations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11090)|
| 3:04:57| What we did, and were asked to do, was to use the school's term contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11097)|
| 3:05:06| That was what PSCD technically would be called, is a term contractor or a term vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11106)|
| 3:05:15| They were used by us after they had been selected as the school district's term contractor in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11115)|
| 3:05:26| I don't know exactly when in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| So what you've got is a legally selected firm by Knox County slash the school district that we were asked to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11128)|
| 3:05:40| And that type of thing is not untypical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11140)|
| 3:05:43| It's certainly not illegal because I'm not doing anything illegal for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11143)|
| 3:05:48| And it's not unethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| And it's actually fairly commonplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| If you talk to your own finance department, I think you'd find that they do like we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11155)|
| 3:06:03| If I'm buying laptop computers, I buy them from my organization off the state bid list because I only buy five or six a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11163)|
| 3:06:12| If you put a bid out for that, you wouldn't even probably get a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| But I mentioned earlier to Mr. Hammond's question, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| there were some cases where we were asked to use the term contractor that we declined and did bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| But in this case, we agreed to use PSCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| And I guess the reason, because we have similar where I work, basic order and agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| You have companies that can go in, architectural firm, excavation firm, that can do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11196)|
| 3:06:41| But that's in my end, with my dealing with it, it's more for not necessarily for price or cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| but more so for being able to respond quickly to an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| If you have a window company out there under this term contract, that's what it's generally for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11212)|
| 3:06:58| Is that the way you deal with it with PBA or with the school system, or do I have that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11218)|
| 3:07:04| Do term contractors normally get involved in construction projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| No, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| What happens is it sounds like our uses are similar in that I have a whole set of term contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11230)|
| 3:07:18| from plumbers to electricians, that do work for my property management department, like work in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11238)|
| 3:07:26| where we select those firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| We have a selection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| It's a very formal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11250)|
| 3:07:31| But normally I select multiple firms in any given trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11251)|
| 3:07:38| In Jeff's department for project management, he also has electrical engineering firms, architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11258)|
| 3:07:45| firms like that, that are selected on a term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| But usually, you're right, you use those for either immediate response or relatively small jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11269)|
| 3:07:57| On the project management side, the side of my house that Mr. Gallion runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11277)|
| 3:08:03| our practice is to use a construction manager and to bid all the pieces of that job through the construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11283)|
| 3:08:12| That's our typical process, and that's what, in fact, Mr. Gallion was beginning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11292)|
| 3:08:20| The reason I rejected the four other uses of term vendors but agreed to use PSCD, and, of course, in hindsight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11300)|
| 3:08:33| I'd like a redo, but you don't get redos in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11313)|
| 3:08:39| So in any event, we used that firm, but it was not speed or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11319)|
| 3:08:46| It was issues of would the entire security system at Hardin Valley and at Powell communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11326)|
| 3:08:55| and I mean that in the most technical sense, with the master system of the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11335)|
| 3:09:01| And that is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| I mean, there are, in some cases, proprietary equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11343)|
| 3:09:08| One proprietary box won't talk to the other proprietary box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| And so that was, I believe, the basis on which we were asked to use PSCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11352)|
| 3:09:19| And, you know, I've got a couple of hundred cameras of my own, and those issues can be real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| I've got to be sure the transit center cameras will talk to my communications center downstairs seamlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11365)|
| 3:09:33| and transfer video and data seamlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11379)|
| 3:09:40| And just a quick question for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11380)|
| 3:09:42| And that's about your, it's projects office, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11382)|
| 3:09:50| I'm sure you call it something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11390)|
| 3:09:52| Yeah, we call it facilities management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| Facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11394)|
| 3:09:55| How large of an office division is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| Yeah, it's actually relatively modest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| and I think that the numbers that Mr. Smith mentioned are probably high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11401)|
| 3:10:07| And I think that's, we did have a conversation about it back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11407)|
| 3:10:11| and I think part of the reason that, you know, we decided not to go in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11411)|
| 3:10:17| is because it's actually a fairly modest operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| I believe we have three professionals and one clerical FTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| full-time equivalent position in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| I'd have to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| So it might be closer to half of what, you know, the numbers that was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11426)|
| 3:10:31| I think it's probably closer to $250,000 or $300,000 rather than $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| But I can certainly, you know, provide those numbers to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| and the commission for your, you know, for you to understand those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11440)|
| 3:10:46| But that was part of what we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11446)|
| 3:10:48| And then the other question as part of the conversation we had in 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11448)|
| 3:10:53| around that, our facilities management area, was really around capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11453)|
| 3:10:58| And it is one of those things where if you outsource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11458)|
| 3:11:04| it would be hard to ever bring it back in-house again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| because you lose capacity and institutional structure that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11467)|
| 3:11:14| is difficult to build back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| And so that was the other part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| or the other part of the consideration when we had that conversation back in 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| and ultimately why we decided to stay with the structure that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| Okay, Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| Dr. McIntyre, just go ahead and state it if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| Just number one, I want to let you know that I'm behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| In fact, I think you're going to get a windfall off of this when all the dust settles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| I think that what's always been said and the concern and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| I think it's going to be a windfall for the schools and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11507)|
| 3:11:52| I want to try to be like what Brad is saying there, be in the helping hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11512)|
| 3:11:56| Here's just an observation that I have seen just from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| I'm just going to offer a suggestion to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| I've already been going to schools in my district and outside my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| And you've mentioned the three things that Simplex is going to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11526)|
| 3:12:11| To me, the fourth one, this is what the principals keep telling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| and it becomes obvious, if you go like what Karen says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| if you look at the cameras and stuff, they're going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| They're going to show your halls and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| But the areas that all the principals tell me that we're lacking in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| and if your survey could do this, is it does not cover the areas, all the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| They're saying, yeah, we've got 16 cameras, but Larry, I need 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| So if we're doing all this and if you feel you need upgrades somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| because otherwise when your survey comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| it's going to give us a false sense of security showing, oh, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| our cameras are working okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| but it doesn't show the areas that we're not getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| Commissioner, I think that's a great point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| and that's part of what the school board has really called for is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| what is our standard or what should our standard be around things like resolution of the cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| in terms of the functionality, in terms of mobility, the tilt, pan, zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| in terms of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| How many cameras should you have in an elementary school that is a rough number of square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| Those types of standards, I think, are something that we really need to take a close look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11595)|
| 3:13:20| And, by the way, some of what has been said today is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11600)|
| 3:13:24| We do not have a video camera system at every single school right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| But I think you know what I have called for and will recommend to the board is that we have a current generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11607)|
| 3:13:34| video camera system in every single school, that we have a school access control strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11614)|
| 3:13:40| which is a locked door with a camera buzzer system or a card reader system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11620)|
| 3:13:44| or a secure vestibule in every single school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| and that we have an armed school resource officer or school security officer in every single school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11627)|
| 3:13:54| What you have in the schools, the school administration, from what I've talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| they're comfortable with what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| They just need more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11640)|
| 3:14:01| Give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11641)|
| 3:14:02| You know, we had the shooting at Central High School, and where the gentleman was shot right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| just because, you know, and it's not the administration or the principal's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| He just needs more cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11651)|
| 3:14:12| He said where that individual was shot, that area is still not covered yet today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11652)|
| 3:14:16| So, you know, and we just need more cameras to cover, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| so that the principal administrations can see all the areas that they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| And, of course, better resolution would help too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| But I think when it's all said and done, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| we're going to be doing something major with the security system and we'll be secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| And I'm behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| If I can help you, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11675)|
| 3:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11677)|
| 3:14:38| Mr. Smith, I've got a few questions just to finish this up and we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| Certainly, I guess my intent of bringing us back in here is not to foment discontent with the system that's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11685)|
| 3:15:01| But certainly after I heard your board speak on the audio file, I thought that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11701)|
| 3:15:10| here's some people that have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| they're very unhappy with the way this security breach is being portrayed in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11712)|
| 3:15:20| And so I consider it an important issue, not just to say, I'd like to say everything's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11720)|
| 3:15:29| and we're going to be okay and we're going to address this, but I'd also not like to be on CNN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11729)|
| 3:15:39| And we have deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11739)|
| 3:15:42| We have serious deficiencies that have been outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| and have been known about for a long period of time through that Stancil Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11745)|
| 3:15:51| and through your obvious contact with officials in central management for a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11751)|
| 3:15:59| That's the reason why we have a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11762)|
| 3:16:03| Am I saying anything out of line right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| If I am, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11769)|
| 3:16:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Now, and another aspect of your board meeting was that there are within the legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11771)|
| 3:16:20| your legal advisors for the lawsuit, there are discussions about criminal charges and fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11780)|
| 3:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| So if we've got civil action being considered, possibly criminal actions being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11790)|
| 3:16:37| and words like fraud being used, we can't sing kumbaya about this and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11797)|
| 3:16:46| I just do not think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| Now, you are alluding the thing that sticks with me the most, Mr. McKenzie just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11809)|
| 3:16:56| and that's procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| Because if I have an issue on the, you know, something that has bugged me for a long time as a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11819)|
| 3:17:08| was how much money goes into the business side of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11828)|
| 3:17:13| because I know how pinched the academic side gets from a teacher's standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11833)|
| 3:17:20| When you said that in 08, and that is, first of all, before I even go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11840)|
| 3:17:31| how long has PSCD worked for the county school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11851)|
| 3:17:37| I don't, I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11857)|
| 3:17:40| I know that they were working as early as 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| I don't know, Jim, were they working earlier than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11863)|
| 3:17:49| My understanding is that that contract went to PSCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11869)|
| 3:17:56| And, again, this is well before my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| but my understanding is that there was a contractor who had the contract for video camera systems sometime in the early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11878)|
| 3:18:09| That company basically either was sold or changed or morphed into PSCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11889)|
| 3:18:16| That contract went with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11896)|
| 3:18:17| And that was sometime around 2003 is what I'm told and what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11897)|
| 3:18:21| And then I understand there was, as Mr. Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11901)|
| 3:18:25| there was a procurement process that happened in 2006 when PSCD was awarded that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11905)|
| 3:18:32| And then there was another in 2011 when Simplex, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11912)|
| 3:18:37| when we went through a process for looking at a new vendor for the security alarm systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11917)|
| 3:18:45| which was Simplex Grinnell, and we currently use a company called Systems Integration for video camera systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11925)|
| 3:18:53| But, nevertheless, I mean, PSCD has been in the business of doing security for Knox County schools for at least six years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11933)|
| 3:19:00| We could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| My understanding is from somewhere around 2003 to sometime in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11941)|
| 3:19:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11945)|
| 3:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| And back to you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| If that's, you know, one of the things that troubles me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11950)|
| 3:19:13| the Stancil report was so condemning about the quality of work, the type of materials that were used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11953)|
| 3:19:19| the equipment that was used, the wiring, total incompatibility on a technical side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11959)|
| 3:19:26| And we have to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| I don't know why we, you know, there's obviously members of this board that are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11968)|
| 3:19:35| I don't think they've read the report or they don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| And for us to think that PSCD has been in the business for this period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11979)|
| 3:19:47| and they've been doing work in 88 schools or thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| and to think that they only did this kind of deficient work in Powell Middle and Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=11992)|
| 3:20:02| I think that would be a real stretch to believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| Now, some of us are wanting to trust and believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12006)|
| 3:20:09| And I like, you know, I like to trust and believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| But I also like to be realistic about the types of work that I think are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12012)|
| 3:20:18| This will come out and the suit will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| And, unfortunately, with the suit, and correct me again, Mr. Smith, if I misstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12021)|
| 3:20:29| if this had been addressed back in 2006, we would not be on this beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12029)|
| 3:20:35| be beyond this statute of limitations, statute of repose or whatever for recovery of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12035)|
| 3:20:42| Is it likely that we will ever recover funds from PSCD in this instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12042)|
| 3:20:50| In regard to our suit, we certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| It was timely filed in regards to the statute of repose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12054)|
| 3:21:01| There usually, with this type of claim, and Mr. Armstrong, please correct me if you think I'm incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12061)|
| 3:21:11| because I'm not an attorney, is a four-year window from completion of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12071)|
| 3:21:18| And so if we identify other deficiencies by PSCD, say from mid-summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12078)|
| 3:21:28| you can basically look back about four years from completion dates of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12088)|
| 3:21:35| And you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| And, in fact, that is why we were discussing reviewing the other schools was exactly because of what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12097)|
| 3:21:46| It seemed to defy logic that they would do the job they did at Hardin Valley and Powell Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12106)|
| 3:21:53| and that would do everything else perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| But I'd like to add, too, that the way this started for both the school district and me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12117)|
| 3:22:08| was stuff that happened four or five years ago fell out of the sky about two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12128)|
| 3:22:15| in the sense that the Stancil report was leaked into the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12135)|
| 3:22:22| And it's been my experience because I've dealt with the media a lot of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12142)|
| 3:22:29| is that when something starts out like that, it usually gets really ugly and messy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12149)|
| 3:22:36| and emotions get high and you start engaging in rhetoric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12156)|
| 3:22:42| including some of my own rhetoric at my own board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| arguably that unnecessarily gets everybody's excitement levels up or concern levels up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12166)|
| 3:22:57| It's my opinion that hopefully coming out in a very near future that really the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12177)|
| 3:23:10| would be able to identify the appropriate company and the appropriate approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12190)|
| 3:23:16| and the appropriate benchmarks by which we can look at all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12196)|
| 3:23:23| Look at them against the kind of standards Dr. McIntyre is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| Because, frankly, it doesn't really help us to have people like me, people like Ms. Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12207)|
| 3:23:36| a principal of a school, declare a camera functional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12216)|
| 3:23:42| because there's very clear industry standards and very industry grading for these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12222)|
| 3:23:49| So if I heard what you're saying right, to be honest, my board's reaction Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12229)|
| 3:24:02| and of course I had just two hours earlier walked out of your commission workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12242)|
| 3:24:07| where Dr. McIntyre and Ms. Carson were speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| my board's reaction was unusually lively, would be the best term to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12252)|
| 3:24:20| because they felt they were in a position of having just been informed that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12260)|
| 3:24:28| Hardin Valley Academy and Powell Middle have not been corrected beyond the firewall penetrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| The Stancil Report is very clear of what's wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12274)|
| 3:24:42| and is alarming in some of its deficiencies when you read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12282)|
| 3:24:48| So the combination of those two things, I think, made them feel like they had been misled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12288)|
| 3:24:57| I had three or four board members that absolutely believed that all the stuff in the Stancil Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| had already been remedied, you know what I mean, until Mr. Kaiser and I told them otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12303)|
| 3:25:09| And so that was part of the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12309)|
| 3:25:16| But I think that the point I believe you made a minute ago was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12316)|
| 3:25:23| I do not think it's a good idea to alarm the public or alarm the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| and have this particular conversation as public and as sloppy and as messy as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12327)|
| 3:25:35| or has been so far, because we're really dealing in techno-geek land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12335)|
| 3:25:43| I mean, the things that are wrong with those systems, you and I wouldn't necessarily be able to identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12343)|
| 3:25:48| but that doesn't mean there aren't deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12348)|
| 3:25:52| And so I think that getting at the answer to what exactly those deficiencies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12352)|
| 3:25:59| where they are, and what really needs to be remedied does need to be done, I think will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12359)|
| 3:26:07| You've offered and the mayor's offered to help that be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12367)|
| 3:26:12| And to be honest, the back end of that discovery, exploratory process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12372)|
| 3:26:19| will probably be a recommendation that is seriously expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12379)|
| 3:26:25| But I also, somebody mentioned earlier, this is kind of a national conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12385)|
| 3:26:33| And I think just from a cost, from a fiduciary responsibility standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12393)|
| 3:26:42| it's important, I think, to see what the national dialogue brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12402)|
| 3:26:47| in terms of the kind of things that Mr. Anders was talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12407)|
| 3:26:51| How many officers should you have at a school of X size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12411)|
| 3:26:56| How many cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| What kind of redundancies do you need to have in your system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12418)|
| 3:27:02| You know, no camera's ever taken out somebody who's been doing bad stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12422)|
| 3:27:08| I mean, so you can overinvest in cameras just like you can underinvest in cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12428)|
| 3:27:15| But I think that for the best, for the good of this community, I think it's a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12435)|
| 3:27:24| and this meeting tomorrow hopefully will be a good start, to simply get down to business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12444)|
| 3:27:31| figure out what we need to do to find the facts, not people's opinion, the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12451)|
| 3:27:37| and then bring those conclusions back to bodies like this and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12457)|
| 3:27:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12464)|
| 3:27:45| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12465)|
| 3:27:46| Not even close to answer what you were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| Well, certainly I was alluding to one thing before I got off on PSCD quite so much on their time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12468)|
| 3:28:00| But this procurement, the procurement issue is not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| When you mentioned it and, by the way, how many items in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12486)|
| 3:28:12| You mentioned several items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| There were several items that were desirable to not bid according to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12494)|
| 3:28:23| There were three, I think, or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| There were four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| The fourth is minutiae, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| And I don't want to go there and beat that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| But we have one investigative reporter that's hot on this story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12513)|
| 3:28:37| Ms. Satterfield is hot on this story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| And she is ‑‑I don't know what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| I think that I feel like the county, if she is finding things in that realm, in project management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12525)|
| 3:28:55| construction management realm, capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12535)|
| 3:29:00| certainly if this is taking place at Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12540)|
| 3:29:05| and there is significant money that is being wasted, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| because the school system wants to choose a certain vendor because they're a preferred vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12549)|
| 3:29:15| we need to investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| And we need to not only investigate that right now, we need to go backwards and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| How often has this occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12563)|
| 3:29:24| How prevalent is it at practice within the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| And so because of that, I mean, that's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| I think Mr. Griffin is going to be the scapegoat for everything here, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12572)|
| 3:29:37| That's just the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| But there are some other connections throughout this central management team that are not being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12579)|
| 3:29:44| And I'm going to ask, I'm certainly going to have a meeting with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12584)|
| 3:29:50| and the mayor, probably finance director, and see if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12590)|
| 3:29:55| And I can be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| I'm not, you know, I don't have perfect vision here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12597)|
| 3:30:01| but I have a different perspective, obviously, from a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12601)|
| 3:30:06| And so when I go there, they'll correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| And if I need to be, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12609)|
| 3:30:14| But I'm certainly led to do that, not because I enjoy controversy, because I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12614)|
| 3:30:22| But I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| And I think Dr. McIntyre has something else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12624)|
| 3:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| I just wanted to say this, that we don't have preferred vendors in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12632)|
| 3:30:38| We have vendors that have gone through a legal procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| and have been designated through that process in the purchasing office as the vendor for those goods or services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12642)|
| 3:30:49| I mean, so, you know, again, I just want to make sure that the perception is clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12649)|
| 3:30:54| because the reality, I believe, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| I think the other thing that's important to note is, you know, Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12657)|
| 3:31:02| and the work that has or has not been done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| And, again, you know, I don't want to get into too much detail because there's litigation ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12666)|
| 3:31:11| But, you know, what I said the other day is certainly we address the life safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| and that's essentially the firewall intrusions that were identified in the Stancer report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12676)|
| 3:31:22| But we also did do an inspection and test of the security panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12682)|
| 3:31:27| and the security alarm systems at Hardin Valley Academy and at Powell by Simplex Grinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12687)|
| 3:31:33| We have had inspections of the fire protection systems at Hardin Valley Academy and at Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12693)|
| 3:31:42| And we have the keyless entry systems at Powell Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| and at Hardin Valley Academy were identified in the Stancer report as having, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| keypads that were on the wall but not hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| All of the keyless entry keypads at both of those schools are functioning at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| And we've done, you know, maintenance and minor repairs and things like that along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| So I don't want people to get the impression that the Stancer report came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| and that all we did was address the firewall intrusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12731)|
| 3:32:16| We certainly have done what we need to do to make sure that we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| and make sure that our systems are functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12740)|
| 3:32:24| And, again, based on all of those tests and inspections and reviews, I can tell you that those systems are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12744)|
| 3:32:32| And as myself and the sheriff and the deputy chief said the other day, those systems are working and our schools are secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12752)|
| 3:32:39| We have those systems that are doing what they need to do to help us keep our kids safe and our schools secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12759)|
| 3:32:47| And certainly, you know, I'm looking forward to the meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12767)|
| 3:32:50| I'm looking forward to the ongoing conversation about how we make our schools safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| because I think there are important things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| And I've outlined three, I think, really critical strategies that we need to put in place to make sure that our schools are even safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12777)|
| 3:33:03| But I am confident that our security alarm systems, our fire protection systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12783)|
| 3:33:08| and our video camera systems are working properly and operating appropriately across Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12788)|
| 3:33:18| based on all of the work and reviews and inspections that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12798)|
| 3:33:21| I think it's important that we go through this review that the Board of Education has called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12801)|
| 3:33:26| because I think we need to affirm that, and I think we need to reassure our stakeholders and the public that that is, in fact, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12806)|
| 3:33:32| But I'm confident that we'll find that to be the case when we go through this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12816)|
| 3:33:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12817)|
| 3:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12818)|
| 3:33:39| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12819)|
| 3:33:40| I'll just respectfully disagree with parts of that, and we'll be at the meeting tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12820)|
| 3:33:46| and hopefully things will start to get better because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12826)|
| 3:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12831)|
| 3:33:52| Any other items here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| Let's go to the ñ are we done with discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12834)|
| 3:33:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12838)|
| 3:34:00| We've got to go to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| Let's move into ñ is that okay with the body if we move into zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| Mr. Chairman, I can take just 60 seconds on the arena use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12851)|
| 3:34:12| That was a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12852)|
| 3:34:13| We'll get it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12853)|
| 3:34:14| The Thompson Bowling Arena, twice a year, they do a report to the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12854)|
| 3:34:18| because we have put money into the Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| They were telling us that, once again, over one million people went into Thompson Bowling Arena over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12861)|
| 3:34:28| which is very ñ when you think about it, a million people going through that facility is very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12868)|
| 3:34:33| They were telling us that, when the NBA is not playing, that Thompson Bowling Arena is the most ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12873)|
| 3:34:38| is the busiest arena in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12878)|
| 3:34:41| When you think of men's basketball, women's basketball, and if they have an event that weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| such as a rodeo or, like they did this past weekend, a bull riding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| they said that they are probably the most active arena in the country outside the NBA when the NBA is not playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12889)|
| 3:34:56| They did identify for us some things that they need to work on, and that is some structural improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12896)|
| 3:35:00| The building was built in the early 80s, so it's approaching 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12900)|
| 3:35:03| So there are some things that they need to do to upgrade facilities, restrooms, roofing, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12903)|
| 3:35:08| But, basically, they're taking care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12908)|
| 3:35:11| and they just wanted us to know that the Thompson Bowling Arena is thriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| and it is alive and well and doing a lot of great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12915)|
| 3:35:18| And so I just wanted to report that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12920)|
| 3:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12921)|
| 3:35:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12922)|
| 3:35:24| Do we need another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12924)|
| 3:35:25| Do we need a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12925)|
| 3:35:26| Do we want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| What do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12927)|
| 3:35:28| Well, you had talked about the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| I think we can dispose of that fairly quickly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| The moving, the date, that discussion item was April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12934)|
| 3:35:40| Our April calendar, we have five Mondays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| and we have some folks on the pension board that would like to possibly move the April commission meeting back to the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12944)|
| 3:35:52| April 29th, instead of, what, the 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| 15th and 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12960)|
| 3:36:01| Third and fifth Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| Third and fifth Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12963)|
| 3:36:04| Would that cause problems calendar-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12964)|
| 3:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| If not, then could we, do we need to make a motion to do that and take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12971)|
| 3:36:19| That's a mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12979)|
| 3:36:20| That's a mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12980)|
| 3:36:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12981)|
| 3:36:22| Then seeing no objection, we're going to stick that on the calendar now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12982)|
| 3:36:27| Jolie's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12987)|
| 3:36:28| It's in law if Jolie's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12988)|
| 3:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12990)|
| 3:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12991)|
| 3:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12995)|
| 3:36:36| We need to check the room availability on that, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12996)|
| 3:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=12999)|
| 3:36:40| Double check that and then kick anybody out who's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| You say five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13005)|
| 3:36:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13006)|
| 3:36:49| We need to take another break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13009)|
| 3:36:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13010)|
| 3:36:54| Let's take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13014)|
| 3:36:55| Five minutes and we'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| Start back and we're going to start with 904 on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13019)|
| 3:37:14| Okay, Madam Clerk, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13034)|
| 3:37:17| Requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13037)|
| 3:37:21| based on the framework set forth on Exhibit A to provide for an incentive program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13041)|
| 3:37:26| to reduce the number of off-premises advertising signs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13046)|
| 3:37:33| Okay, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13053)|
| 3:37:34| I believe this would be the wording in this would really be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13054)|
| 3:37:41| needs to wait until the second reading of that ordinance, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| because it could be a mute point or it could be changed based on the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13064)|
| 3:37:49| the second reading of Ordinance 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| Do you want to just do that one first and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| Or do it after Ordinance 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| Do it right after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13076)|
| 3:37:57| This could totally change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13077)|
| 3:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13078)|
| 3:37:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| Ordinance 13-1-103 to amend Article II and Article III of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13084)|
| 3:38:11| Appendix A of the Knox County Code to prohibit the conversion of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13091)|
| 3:38:15| and other advertising signs to electronic advertising signs or electronic message centers in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13095)|
| 3:38:22| Ordinance No. 099-130 adopted 9-10-90 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13102)|
| 3:38:29| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13112)|
| 3:38:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13114)|
| 3:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13116)|
| 3:38:37| Dr. Briggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| Well, really, I don't want to take up a lot of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| We've had months and months and months of discussions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13121)|
| 3:38:46| The way this is proposed now is a compromise because we did drop the ban on the new conventional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13126)|
| 3:38:53| We did drop the ban on the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13133)|
| 3:38:56| I think that was a very substantial concession both to the smaller advertiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13136)|
| 3:39:02| and to the businesses that claim that they need these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| And I think that was very fair for us to go ahead and drop these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| What this is now is a very clear, and I really do want to make it clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13150)|
| 3:39:17| because I think that the final ordinance right here may have some confusing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13157)|
| 3:39:23| But one of the things I would like the law director to share with us is that the original ordinance just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13163)|
| 3:39:31| the conversion of conventional billboards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13171)|
| 3:39:35| And the one that we're considering tonight, we want to add on there new digital billboards also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13175)|
| 3:39:43| just to make that absolutely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| And I think this is a clear, concise, and unambiguous ordinance that simply says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13186)|
| 3:39:55| we don't want any more digital billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13195)|
| 3:39:58| I really don't want to complicate it with anything else, dealing with fluttering signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13198)|
| 3:40:03| or dealing with, you know, three-sided signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| But, first of all, get an opinion from the law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| Can we add new, a ban on new digital billboards and have that not be a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13209)|
| 3:40:17| I believe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13217)|
| 3:40:20| However, the motion on the floor, if I'm not mistaken, is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13220)|
| 3:40:26| So we'd need to make a motion for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13226)|
| 3:40:28| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13228)|
| 3:40:29| To add to that the ban on all new digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| And just to kind of get a sense of what the commission wants, last time we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13233)|
| 3:40:40| the commission wanted to ban new digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| that you would prohibit construction or conversion of digital billboards in the county in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13243)|
| 3:40:49| So that's what I've passed out to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| It makes minor revisions to the language of the conversion ordinance that MPC proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13254)|
| 3:41:02| that adds, you know, the construction or conversion language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13262)|
| 3:41:07| so that you wouldn't have future digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| And if I just may, when Metropolitan Planning Commission initially proposed these amendments to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13271)|
| 3:41:20| they gave us three companion ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13280)|
| 3:41:23| One was for a total ban on all billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| The second one was to prohibit the conversion of those existing billboards to electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13287)|
| 3:41:34| And the third thing was regulation of electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13294)|
| 3:41:42| When you look at those ordinances, they were companions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| They referred to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| The language meshed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13307)|
| 3:41:50| What commission has done is sent the first and the third thing back to Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13310)|
| 3:41:54| so what's left is the conversion of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| And because the ban and the prohibition on conversion would have effectively prohibited electronic billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13320)|
| 3:42:12| and I think it's a substantial revision to amend this language, as I've handed out here on this exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| to prohibit new digital billboards and conversions of regular billboards to electronic billboards or digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13338)|
| 3:42:27| So that's what you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13347)|
| 3:42:31| That was the sense I got from you last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13351)|
| 3:42:35| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13355)|
| 3:42:40| It's not a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13360)|
| 3:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13362)|
| 3:42:43| So it's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13363)|
| 3:42:47| The amendment or the addition of banning new digital billboards is not a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13367)|
| 3:42:55| I don't believe so because those three things that came with the initial proposal would have effectively done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13375)|
| 3:43:03| And I've consulted with Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| They don't think that their recommendation would have changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13386)|
| 3:43:09| had commission only requested this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13389)|
| 3:43:14| Is it just me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13394)|
| 3:43:15| Do you all understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| I don't think we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13400)|
| 3:43:21| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Can we add an amendment to ban new digital billboards to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13403)|
| 3:43:29| I believe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13410)|
| 3:43:31| So rather than approve a motion to approve, we need a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13411)|
| 3:43:35| I would accept that as an amendment to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13415)|
| 3:43:39| And I'll second that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| In the form that's given here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| And I'll mark this as Exhibit A and hand it to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13425)|
| 3:43:48| And just to make this just as clean and as clear as we can is that we're talking about digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13428)|
| 3:43:55| We're not talking about the electronic on-premise electronic message signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13435)|
| 3:44:01| We're not talking about conventional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| We're not talking about the static off-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13443)|
| 3:44:10| It's just real clear is that what we're voting on is to ban new digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13450)|
| 3:44:17| and to ban the conversion of the conventional billboards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13457)|
| 3:44:24| Is that clear to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13464)|
| 3:44:25| It's clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13465)|
| 3:44:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13468)|
| 3:44:29| Anything else, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| Well, I wanted to make an argument for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13473)|
| 3:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13474)|
| 3:44:35| For just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| And, you know, I respect, you know, what Commissioner Andrews is trying to do with his compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13476)|
| 3:44:42| but the e-mails that I've received from people in the outdoor advertising business that deals really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13482)|
| 3:44:50| with this compromise that you propose is a lot of them feel that that will advantage one company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13490)|
| 3:44:57| and it could very well put some of these companies out of business that are in business right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13497)|
| 3:45:03| because of the advantages they would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13503)|
| 3:45:06| I think, and I don't think he'll mind me quoting him if he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13506)|
| 3:45:09| is Gary Douglas has been down here almost at every meeting arguing against these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13509)|
| 3:45:14| He sent me a very long, and I don't know if you all received it either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13514)|
| 3:45:17| a very long e-mail as to why this would be very bad for his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13517)|
| 3:45:21| I was talking to some of our other, some of the other businessmen that's been down here for every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13521)|
| 3:45:27| and they feel that the compromise would very much harm them and would help one company and one company alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13527)|
| 3:45:34| And if we are considering voting this down to look at that other compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13534)|
| 3:45:41| just be aware that we're hurting a lot of small businesses in Knox County by doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| and we're doing it to the favor of one company that's an out-of-state company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| And, you know, if it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| If we want to ignore all the people that have come down here all these times, all the e-mails, you know, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13556)|
| 3:46:02| But I think at some point we have to take public opinion in the defense of our own small businessmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13562)|
| 3:46:10| and the businesses that advertise with these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13570)|
| 3:46:14| And I think this levels the playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13574)|
| 3:46:18| It allows everybody to compete fairly and whether they're big or small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13578)|
| 3:46:23| And to me it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| And then also I think there is a lot of public support for this ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13585)|
| 3:46:29| And, you know, I'm ready to vote on it tonight and let it be what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13589)|
| 3:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13595)|
| 3:46:36| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13596)|
| 3:46:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13597)|
| 3:46:38| Mr. Ammons came up to us before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13598)|
| 3:46:41| Mr. Ammons, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| Would you like to approach or do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13603)|
| 3:46:48| Did you get your answer from the law director's office about whether or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| And then Russ Ammons, 7920 Ewing Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| And then I asked Dr. Briggs about it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| And, Mr. Law Director, you know, my concern about this was we've always talked about digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13618)|
| 3:47:06| And we've addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13626)|
| 3:47:08| But the way that I see it is electronic billboards, you're encompassing all billboards that have moving parts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13628)|
| 3:47:14| And there are three-sided billboards that, you know, do not have any additional lights or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13634)|
| 3:47:19| which apparently many people oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| And I just didn't want this to encompass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13641)|
| 3:47:24| And then after we're talking with Dr. Briggs, he says, no, that's not what his intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13644)|
| 3:47:29| So how do we negotiate that or how do we see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13649)|
| 3:47:37| The definition of electronic advertising sign reads that an advertising sign utilizing a mechanical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13657)|
| 3:47:43| or electronic means to formal or alter the announcement direction or advertisement appearing on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13663)|
| 3:47:52| That would include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13672)|
| 3:47:54| Does it double-sided or tri-sided, which is what the little guy's on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13674)|
| 3:47:57| A sign that has moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13678)|
| 3:47:59| And according to Dr. Briggs, that's not his intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| Are we talking about those that flutter, you know, where the flip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| They flip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| Every nine to ten seconds, they turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| So they're three-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| There's no additional lighting on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13691)|
| 3:48:13| All they do is turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13693)|
| 3:48:17| You know, we could get into a discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13697)|
| 3:48:20| You know, I think right now what I would prefer to do is to address that at another, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13700)|
| 3:48:26| at another session if we have to and just restrict this to the electronic means of changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13706)|
| 3:48:32| In other words, the pure digital billboards, because I think that's what people are opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13712)|
| 3:48:41| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13721)|
| 3:48:42| I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13722)|
| 3:48:43| I mean, it's the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13725)|
| 3:48:46| And I completely agree with your discussion and your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13726)|
| 3:48:49| But this also could, by, you know, codes enforcement, we pass this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13729)|
| 3:48:58| Codes enforcement takes that away from the ability for the little guys that have double-sided, tri-sided signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13738)|
| 3:49:04| It takes them away from them to convert their static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| The little guys, the hometown guys that can't do digital but can do rotating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13746)|
| 3:49:11| it takes Mr. Ammon's ability away to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13751)|
| 3:49:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13754)|
| 3:49:15| Maybe I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13755)|
| 3:49:16| What I would do, I would strike the word mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13756)|
| 3:49:18| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13758)|
| 3:49:19| It's electronic advertising signs definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| Legal definition says anything that uses mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13761)|
| 3:49:25| We can make any definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| I didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| The law director's office did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| We make the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| I mean, we make the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13771)|
| 3:49:32| What I'm saying is that we can ban what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| We can do what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13774)|
| 3:49:36| And if we want to change what an electronic advertising sign is, we can change it to a digital sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13776)|
| 3:49:43| I mean, I think when people say digital billboards, they know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13783)|
| 3:49:50| I mean, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13790)|
| 3:49:51| I don't mean to speak out of order, but could we, it's a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| but could we exclude this mechanically rotating thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| Could we specifically exclude that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| That way, I mean, if that's not what we want to say, we should say we're not talking about X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13801)|
| 3:50:08| It seems to me that we can define what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13808)|
| 3:50:11| If we want to say a digital billboard is, and I'm just going to change this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13811)|
| 3:50:15| is what we're talking about is banning digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| said advertising sign utilizing electronic means to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13817)|
| 3:50:22| or advertisement appearing on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13822)|
| 3:50:25| I mean, that's what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13825)|
| 3:50:26| We've been talking about digital billboards from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13826)|
| 3:50:29| Now, all of a sudden, we've got electronic advertising sign, which, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13829)|
| 3:50:33| this is the first time I've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13833)|
| 3:50:39| This definition came from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13839)|
| 3:50:42| when they initially proposed all three ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13842)|
| 3:50:48| So we've had this on the agenda for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| However, I believe that the commission could strike the word mechanical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13852)|
| 3:50:56| or so that the definition read an advertising sign utilizing electronic means to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13856)|
| 3:51:04| or alter the announcement direction or advertisement appearing on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13864)|
| 3:51:07| One of the considerations when a court looks at it and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13867)|
| 3:51:12| is this a substantial change, is whether it harms the persons that oppose the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13872)|
| 3:51:21| And if you were to narrow the definition of electronic sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13881)|
| 3:51:26| then that would, in fact, give more latitude to the people who operate billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13886)|
| 3:51:32| and it would be less imposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13892)|
| 3:51:34| Well, I think it causes less harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13894)|
| 3:51:35| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13895)|
| 3:51:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13896)|
| 3:51:37| It causes less harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13897)|
| 3:51:38| So I think by striking that, we're making it less restrictive and less harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13898)|
| 3:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| So you're saying just keep it the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13913)|
| 3:51:54| We're going to strike the word mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13914)|
| 3:51:57| You would be allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13919)|
| 3:52:00| So if I was to go to Bill Pierce and ask for one of these, he wouldn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13920)|
| 3:52:04| He would issue me a permit for a turning sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| As long as it doesn't have an electric or electronic means to alter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13927)|
| 3:52:15| By that, we're talking about the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| The mechanicals have to be changed electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| They don't just automatically do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13939)|
| 3:52:23| Yeah, but see, we're striking the word mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| See, we're striking the word mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13947)|
| 3:52:31| Well, a three-sided sign is mechanical because it's turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13954)|
| 3:52:35| We're striking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13955)|
| 3:52:36| But it's electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13956)|
| 3:52:38| Well, everything's got electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13958)|
| 3:52:39| I mean, they've got lights on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13961)|
| 3:52:42| I just don't want this broad scope taking it in when it's not your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13962)|
| 3:52:47| So, I mean, what we say here is great, but what happens in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13967)|
| 3:52:51| or whenever I go make a permit and Bill says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13971)|
| 3:52:54| well, no, I can't do this because the law director says I can't do this and it wasn't your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13974)|
| 3:52:58| I just want that clarified, if you would, somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13978)|
| 3:53:01| I actually think that's really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| I mean, it's a mechanical sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| It turns mechanically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| I mean, of course, I know you're not hiring a guy or a girl to turn it every eight to ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13988)|
| 3:53:14| So, that is a mechanical sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13994)|
| 3:53:16| As long as the law director and everybody knows intent, I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=13996)|
| 3:53:20| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14000)|
| 3:53:28| Getting loud over here, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14008)|
| 3:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14012)|
| 3:53:33| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| It's been amazing to me to watch the evolution of billboards in our community over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| because I work for a company that was a heavy user of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14020)|
| 3:53:43| And I can remember when we used to put glitter on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14023)|
| 3:53:46| And because the sun would hit the glitter, it would blind people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| and so they outlawed glitter and we couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| And then I remember we had a helicopter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| and we used to have the top of the helicopter that would turn when the wind would blow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| and then we couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| And then we had an airplane and we had the propeller that would turn when the wind would blow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| and we couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| And then we had our van where we would have our lights flashing and we couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14045)|
| 3:54:10| So, you know, these things are always coming up and these things always evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| And so now we're at the digital stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14054)|
| 3:54:17| I'd like to address Mr. Anders if I could just directly say, Brad, this compromise that you have proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14057)|
| 3:54:23| what exactly does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| What is different from what we have before us on this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14065)|
| 3:54:29| In other words, what language would be there that's not there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14069)|
| 3:54:32| Well, what the framework does is necessary, I think, whether or not digital is in that framework or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14072)|
| 3:54:38| because last month we put MPC in a bind, in a corner they didn't want to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14078)|
| 3:54:44| if I'm speaking correctly, about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| Is that right, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14089)|
| 3:54:50| So, you know, one side wants to eliminate or at least no new billboards ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14090)|
| 3:55:02| And they would love to see as many disappear as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14102)|
| 3:55:06| Whether or not they would want them all gone or not, I can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14106)|
| 3:55:12| And the framework was established, I spoke with Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14112)|
| 3:55:16| and the framework was established that if billboard, if digital, whether or not digital is a part of it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14116)|
| 3:55:22| you know, any new billboard would require, if we did the swap and trade and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14122)|
| 3:55:29| the goal of eliminating or reducing the number of billboards cannot be accomplished under what we presented last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14129)|
| 3:55:39| because that's just dealing with new billboards where their zoning requirements have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14139)|
| 3:55:45| And so the framework that's in that resolution would provide MPC guidelines to come back to see if we need to strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14145)|
| 3:55:55| our ordinances or strengthen our zoning or do overlays and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| And so that's all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| My framework is a request for MPC to look at everything all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14161)|
| 3:56:07| and gives them framework where last month we put them in a corner that they didn't want to be in with use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14167)|
| 3:56:13| So, Mark, what are your thoughts about, are you in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14173)|
| 3:56:17| I'm not going to ask you if you're in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14179)|
| 3:56:20| But your thoughts on what Mr. Anders has proposed, because you addressed this last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14180)|
| 3:56:25| and your comment was that you felt like we had thrown you under a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14185)|
| 3:56:29| And I've thought about that comment since you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| And I'd like for you to just kind of reiterate that again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14191)|
| 3:56:34| Well, not me personally, but the planning commission would, under the instructions received last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14194)|
| 3:56:41| we were to consider the approval of new billboards and electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14201)|
| 3:56:47| as uses permitted on review so that with every controversial application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14207)|
| 3:56:53| the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the 15 members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| would be faced with the decision of saying yay or nay on every new billboard or every new electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14217)|
| 3:57:06| I think it is a much better approach to establish regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14226)|
| 3:57:09| and allow permits to be issued if they meet those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14229)|
| 3:57:15| There aren't enough criteria that we could put in place to remove the discretion that is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14235)|
| 3:57:22| under the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14242)|
| 3:57:25| So that's the throwing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| My impression of Commissioner Anders' framework is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14249)|
| 3:57:33| kind of given that the commission was headed towards a cap on the total number of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14253)|
| 3:57:40| we've heard that there are nearly 500 in the city and about 400 outside of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14260)|
| 3:57:48| so a total of 900 billboards in Knox County, that, you know, that might be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14268)|
| 3:57:55| I think that a cap-and-trade, in quotes, program starts with a cap, a prohibition on new boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14275)|
| 3:58:04| but allows trading at a rate of removal of old billboards in exchange for either the relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14284)|
| 3:58:14| of existing billboards or, at that time, we were still talking about the potential conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14294)|
| 3:58:19| of a billboard to a digital or electronic billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14299)|
| 3:58:26| And my mind was only to send them a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14306)|
| 3:58:30| They have to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14310)|
| 3:58:31| They have to approve it and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| And so it would kind of keep the process going, but it takes them from the they don't like the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14313)|
| 3:58:40| They're going to have to have guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| If this matter fails or if this matter passes of banning digital, they still need framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14322)|
| 3:58:47| So this framework is, it included digital, but if digital is not a part of it, they still need framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14327)|
| 3:58:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14337)|
| 3:58:58| The so-called cap-and-trade program could apply to existing static billboards as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14338)|
| 3:59:06| by capping the number of boards at the number that we have now, creating a program to allow for the relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14346)|
| 3:59:13| of a legal billboard on the premise that they're going to take down a number of other billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14353)|
| 3:59:25| So it satisfies, from the discussion that we heard at the public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14365)|
| 3:59:31| the industry is very interested in the flexibility to follow development wherever it might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14371)|
| 3:59:38| And the opponents of billboards, I think, really want to reduce the number of billboards from that current level of 900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14378)|
| 3:59:48| at a rate greater than the attrition rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14388)|
| 3:59:52| So this kind of a program could achieve both of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14392)|
| 3:59:58| So the language that Mr. Anders is suggesting you said would achieve both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14398)|
| 4:00:03| A program that we've been calling cap-and-trade could do, could achieve both of those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14403)|
| 4:00:10| It could allow flexibility to move existing billboards once they've been capped at a certain number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14410)|
| 4:00:17| And in doing so, it would require the removal of a certain number of other billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14417)|
| 4:00:24| thereby reducing the total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14424)|
| 4:00:26| But even so, I mean, if it comes back, MPC's proposal comes back to be harmful to local small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14426)|
| 4:00:33| then we don't have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| It just has to, I mean, they need framework to begin the process of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14435)|
| 4:00:39| getting it out of use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14439)|
| 4:00:44| I'm at a disadvantage here because I was not educated in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14444)|
| 4:00:48| I was educated in Hawkins County, so I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| So you need to help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14452)|
| 4:00:55| If we say, or let me say, if I say yes to the ordinance that is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14455)|
| 4:01:04| then we're basically saying no more billboards, no more digitals, but the mechanicals are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14464)|
| 4:01:11| I kind of view them like the blinds on your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14471)|
| 4:01:14| You know, your blinds go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14474)|
| 4:01:15| You have different messages on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| So those are going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| But it's the digital Las Vegas type things we're talking about, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14479)|
| 4:01:23| where you have the lights and the flashing, and they're there for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14483)|
| 4:01:26| and it's not the mechanical blinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14486)|
| 4:01:29| So the mechanical would be okay, digital not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14489)|
| 4:01:33| Except the ones we have now, they would be grandfathered in, or they have to go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14493)|
| 4:01:39| the digital billboards that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| Electronic advertising signs would be registered and then established as legal, non-conforming structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14501)|
| 4:01:52| Yes, they would be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14512)|
| 4:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14514)|
| 4:01:55| So Mr. Anders has come up with some language that I understand you're saying that even if we pass Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14515)|
| 4:02:03| Briggs' ordinance here, that you're going to need some additional framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14523)|
| 4:02:07| You're going to need some additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14527)|
| 4:02:10| Am I reading this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14530)|
| 4:02:11| This is what I'm trying to get at is, do we also need to incorporate, as part of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14531)|
| 4:02:17| some of Commissioner Anders' language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| Does this need to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14539)|
| 4:02:20| Does it need to be a separate ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14540)|
| 4:02:23| What you're dealing with right now is only the last of three recommended ordinances that we put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14543)|
| 4:02:35| The two previous ones were dealing with all billboards, prohibiting all billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14555)|
| 4:02:40| and regulating and or prohibiting electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14560)|
| 4:02:46| You've put off the decision on those, and you're dealing only now with the electronic advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14566)|
| 4:02:54| Those other two are still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14574)|
| 4:02:57| You haven't killed them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14577)|
| 4:02:59| You haven't acted on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14579)|
| 4:03:02| There was discussion about sending them back to the Planning Commission to consider allowing them as uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14582)|
| 4:03:09| This would augment that to consider some sort of an incentive program to deal with the existing billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14589)|
| 4:03:17| and electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| Those are kind of two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14599)|
| 4:03:23| So if we are in favor of a cap-and-trade type of thing, like you've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14603)|
| 4:03:29| then we couldn't say we couldn't pass electronic advertising that would need to be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14609)|
| 4:03:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| These are two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| This right now, what we're dealing with, what this vote is right now, is do you or do you not want to allow conversion to digital billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14619)|
| 4:03:47| And new digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| And new digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14629)|
| 4:03:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14630)|
| 4:03:51| I just say no more digital billboards, whether they're new or converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14631)|
| 4:03:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14635)|
| 4:03:56| That's what we're dealing with on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14636)|
| 4:03:57| So this vote is, do you want to allow the industry to convert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14637)|
| 4:04:03| And if we do or if we don't, then we'll have to still have to do the framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14643)|
| 4:04:08| It would be slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14648)|
| 4:04:10| But if we do want the industry to convert, then we would vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14654)|
| 4:04:15| This is what I'm trying to get at is exactly what I'm going to be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| So I have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| Now, and if we come back and say, okay, no, we feel like that there should be an opportunity to convert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14659)|
| 4:04:25| then we'll work on the framework of how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14665)|
| 4:04:28| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14668)|
| 4:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14669)|
| 4:04:30| Thank you for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14670)|
| 4:04:32| I needed to fully understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14672)|
| 4:04:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14674)|
| 4:04:37| Ms. Burwells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| Come on, Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14680)|
| 4:04:43| She's not going to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| I'm just going to state the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14685)|
| 4:04:48| These people are here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| They've said over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that they don't want digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14690)|
| 4:04:55| Our constituents have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| They've spoken clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14697)|
| 4:04:58| They've spoken as a large group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14698)|
| 4:05:01| So I don't even see why we're continuing to go back and forth on the whole digital thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14701)|
| 4:05:05| I'm okay with whatever you want to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14705)|
| 4:05:10| I know they're not happy about cap and trade either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14710)|
| 4:05:14| I'm concerned about our small business owners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| But the big thing is no digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14717)|
| 4:05:22| Off to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14724)|
| 4:05:25| Just a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| We're almost there, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14727)|
| 4:05:28| I just want to make a comment because never has it been said by me or anyone here that we wanted to reduce the number of billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14728)|
| 4:05:37| We've not ever said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| That's never been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14739)|
| 4:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14744)|
| 4:05:45| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14745)|
| 4:05:46| And would you, I think if we don't have anything else, would you restate the wording that's before us on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14746)|
| 4:05:55| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| If I remember correctly, we've had a motion to approve this Exhibit A that we've handed the clerk that you all have a copy of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14757)|
| 4:06:04| But as it stands, it includes the mechanical language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14764)|
| 4:06:08| There would need to be an amendment to the motion in a second that would remove the mechanical verb or the mechanical adjective there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14768)|
| 4:06:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14779)|
| 4:06:20| The second agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14780)|
| 4:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14781)|
| 4:06:22| That was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14782)|
| 4:06:25| That was the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14787)|
| 4:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14788)|
| 4:06:29| So, this is an ordinance to amend Article 2, Section 2.20 by adding the following definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14789)|

| 4:06:59| An owner of any advertising sign or advertising sign, business sign, electronic advertising or electronic advertising sign legally existing at the time of the adoption of this amendment shall have the right to continue such nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14819)|
| 4:07:17| An owner of any electronic advertising sign legally existing at the time of the adoption of this amendment shall have until a date and that date will need to be added by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14837)|
| 4:07:33| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14853)|
| 4:07:34| We'll have to make one more amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14854)|
| 4:07:41| What do you recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14861)|
| 4:07:42| Is 90 days enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14862)|
| 4:07:43| Six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14863)|
| 4:07:44| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14864)|
| 4:07:45| Well, originally it was July 1, 2013, and we didn't know whether that was going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14865)|
| 4:07:53| So, June, July, August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14873)|
| 4:07:57| If it passes today, that's roughly 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| It's a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| I guess that's four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| I don't think that date is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14883)|
| 4:08:11| It shouldn't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14891)|
| 4:08:12| August 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14892)|
| 4:08:13| There's only 11 of them, and they're all owned by one company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14893)|
| 4:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14898)|
| 4:08:19| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14899)|
| 4:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14900)|
| 4:08:21| You're okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14901)|
| 4:08:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14902)|
| 4:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14903)|
| 4:08:24| Any other comments before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14904)|
| 4:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14908)|
| 4:08:29| The date is July 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14909)|
| 4:08:30| July 1, and I'll continue with there are two more subsections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14910)|
| 4:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14913)|
| 4:08:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14914)|
| 4:08:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14915)|
| 4:08:36| Subsection C, after July 1, 2013, no person shall construct any electronic advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14916)|
| 4:08:42| sign or convert any existing advertising sign to an electronic advertising sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14922)|
| 4:08:49| And in subsection D, after July 1, 2013, any non-conforming electronic advertising sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14929)|
| 4:08:57| not registered shall be considered an illegal sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| The codes administrator shall notify or make a reasonable effort to notify the owner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14940)|
| 4:09:05| the sign of such condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14945)|
| 4:09:07| If, after 30 days of such notification, the sign has not been removed by the owner, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14947)|
| 4:09:12| county, its officials, or its employees shall have authority to enter onto the private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14952)|
| 4:09:18| on which the sign is located to remove such sign and or institute appropriate action to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14958)|
| 4:09:23| have the sign removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14963)|
| 4:09:24| The county is further authorized to place a lien in the amount of the removal cost against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14964)|
| 4:09:28| the property upon which the illegal non-conforming sign is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14968)|
| 4:09:32| What date did you put under C there after what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14972)|
| 4:09:35| July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14975)|
| 4:09:36| July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14976)|
| 4:09:37| Well, then, so then they would have, that needs to be today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14977)|
| 4:09:40| That would be the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14980)|
| 4:09:43| But would they be permitted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14983)|
| 4:09:46| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14986)|
| 4:09:47| Well, I mean, if they went out, they could get out and get 100 permits today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14987)|
| 4:09:50| That date needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14990)|
| 4:09:53| Upon signing of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14993)|
| 4:09:54| Yeah, upon signing of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| Signing of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14996)|
| 4:09:57| But they wouldn't be able to get a permit while this is moving through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=14997)|
| 4:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| So the date doesn't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| I mean, they're not going to be, they would not be permitted to get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15005)|
| 4:10:08| No, not if you vote this affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15008)|
| 4:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15014)|
| 4:10:15| Just so we don't all of a sudden get out and get enough permits to cover it the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15015)|
| 4:10:19| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15019)|
| 4:10:20| As long as this, if the commission votes this up and it moves through the process and becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15020)|
| 4:10:25| effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15025)|
| 4:10:26| That wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15026)|
| 4:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15027)|
| 4:10:28| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15028)|
| 4:10:29| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15029)|
| 4:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15030)|
| 4:10:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15031)|
| 4:10:34| Advertising sign electronic, what you read in bold print to begin with there, Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15034)|
| 4:10:41| Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15041)|
| 4:10:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15042)|
| 4:10:43| Did you read utilizing mechanical or did you strike that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15043)|
| 4:10:47| We struck mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15047)|
| 4:10:48| Struck that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| And advertising sign, read to me again how it reads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15049)|
| 4:10:56| How it should read as we're voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15056)|
| 4:11:00| Advertising sign electronic, an advertising sign utilizing electronic means to form or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15060)|
| 4:11:07| alter the announcement direction or advertisement appearing on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15067)|
| 4:11:13| And then the verbiage that we received from MPC, we're taking that mechanical out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15073)|
| 4:11:21| also, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15081)|
| 4:11:24| That is the definition that came as a recommendation from MPC and you've struck that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15084)|
| 4:11:29| That's the current motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15089)|
| 4:11:35| In last month's meeting, after the meeting was over, someone came up here and asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15095)|
| 4:11:43| why I did not vote to ban billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15103)|
| 4:11:48| And my answer was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15108)|
| 4:11:51| It was in the form of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| I asked what was the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15113)|
| 4:11:57| The motion that was before us was to send it back to MPC, that particular one, for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15117)|
| 4:12:05| A month later, we get the results of that and my no vote was correct because we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15125)|
| 4:12:14| should not have been sending it back to MPC for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15134)|
| 4:12:22| Today, when I read this last paragraph, which we, I don't think, discussed last month, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15142)|
| 4:12:30| fairly strict upon county officials entering private property, no matter maybe what the cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15150)|
| 4:12:40| if there is something that could be pending, I'm uncomfortable with that last paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15160)|
| 4:12:50| I believe that I best say up front this time why I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15170)|
| 4:12:57| I think that electronic billboards in Knox County probably need to be regulated and maybe regulated out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15177)|
| 4:13:07| But they need to be regulated, not prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15187)|
| 4:13:11| And I'll go one step further in my logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| If you go up 75, you could be in Larry Smith's district or you could be in the next county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15194)|
| 4:13:22| On one side of that line, people might be making fairly good tax contributions to Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15202)|
| 4:13:30| while on the Knox County side, which may or may not be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15210)|
| 4:13:35| there might be people that would like to have a billboard there to advertise or do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15215)|
| 4:13:41| So, anyway, I believe I've brought up enough points in my mind to think that really what's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15221)|
| 4:13:47| I'll have to vote against because I think billboards need to be regulated, not banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15227)|
| 4:14:02| Okay, we don't have any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15242)|
| 4:14:04| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15244)|
| 4:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15247)|
| 4:14:08| I think we're going to have to roll call this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15248)|
| 4:14:12| Mr. Shouse, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15252)|

| 4:16:42| and he has requested that we defer until the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15402)|

| 4:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15414)|

| 4:17:01| Mr. Chairman, if it's not necessary, or do you have to defer the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15421)|
| 4:17:08| Yeah, just the same thing for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15428)|

| 4:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15594)|
| 4:19:56| I'd like to make a motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15596)|
| 4:19:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15599)|
| 4:20:00| Motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15600)|
| 4:20:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15602)|
| 4:20:03| Okay, we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15603)|
| 4:20:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15604)|
| 4:20:07| Okay, I've got a few questions right here, Mr. Biddle, and for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15607)|
| 4:20:11| Because this is a slope protection area, of course, I've got to dig a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15611)|
| 4:20:18| You're not allowed to dig on slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15618)|
| 4:20:23| Touche, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15623)|
| 4:20:27| First, I guess, for Mark and Buzz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15627)|
| 4:20:30| could you give a discussion about the density changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15630)|
| 4:20:34| And just in regards to the map, I've got the documents from KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15634)|
| 4:20:41| There's a creek that runs through one part of the parcel, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15641)|
| 4:20:47| Hickory Creek runs through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| Not Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15649)|
| 4:20:50| The creek that shows on the GIS system is a wet weather conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15650)|
| 4:20:57| It's a ditch that runs with water whenever it rains, but it doesn't continue flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15657)|
| 4:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15663)|
| 4:21:07| The area that was designated as the hillside protection area, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15667)|
| 4:21:15| just give a discussion of density and how you – the staff recommendations were 1.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15675)|
| 4:21:22| and we changed to 2.8 that was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15682)|
| 4:21:28| So would you just give a discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15688)|
| 4:21:31| Yeah, and that discussion takes us back to the growth policy plan as a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15691)|
| 4:21:36| This particular property is located in what we call the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15696)|
| 4:21:42| as designated in the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15702)|
| 4:21:44| and there is a current policy that density should not be greater than two units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15704)|
| 4:21:51| When we ran the calculations based on the metrics in the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15711)|
| 4:21:59| the first number that came out was 1.8 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15719)|
| 4:22:04| After discussions with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15724)|
| 4:22:06| they were agreeable to setting aside the most tree-covered part of the hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15726)|
| 4:22:13| which would have qualified them for up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15733)|
| 4:22:18| But the planning commission decided to go against the growth policy plan recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15738)|
| 4:22:25| and recommend 2.8 units based on the current extension of wastewater system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15745)|
| 4:22:34| out to covered bridge subdivision, which is half a mile from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15754)|
| 4:22:44| And with the understanding that the original rural area was determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15764)|
| 4:22:54| using the gravity flow wastewater system as the determinant of that boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15774)|
| 4:23:03| the covered bridge will extend that wastewater treatment area out to this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15783)|
| 4:23:13| thereby opening up to more of the planned growth type scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15793)|
| 4:23:19| So after that discussion, they determined that 2.8 would be the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15799)|
| 4:23:25| and made that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| We have since worked with the applicant on coming up with a land plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15807)|
| 4:23:33| that takes advantage of the incentives that were created by the recommendations of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15813)|
| 4:23:38| and ridgetop protection plan and adopted into our subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15818)|
| 4:23:45| which allow for skinnier streets, narrower right-of-way, elimination of curb and gutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15825)|
| 4:23:53| so that they are much more flexible in planning lots within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15833)|
| 4:24:00| And we feel that we can, based on the preliminary sketch plans that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15840)|
| 4:24:06| can save the most heavily forested areas in the hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15846)|
| 4:24:12| while still accommodating the 2.8 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15852)|
| 4:24:18| and still doing connectivity to adjacent undeveloped properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15858)|
| 4:24:26| So we've really the preliminary concept plan is getting away from the idea of cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15866)|
| 4:24:33| It's a very connected street pattern, which in making its recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15873)|
| 4:24:39| the planning commission kind of challenged them to do this in a very good suburban style of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15879)|
| 4:24:46| since they were getting that kind of density based on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15886)|
| 4:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15893)|
| 4:24:54| So what I'm hearing is that the staffers are comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15894)|
| 4:24:59| or they have a level of comfort with the way these plans are conforming to the intent of the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15899)|
| 4:25:08| Given that 2.8 is going to be the number, I think we've got to come up with a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15908)|
| 4:25:14| that achieves the principles of the hillside plan by preserving the most heavily forested areas of the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15914)|
| 4:25:28| And this particular piece of land, there is a fairly significant part of the property that's within the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15928)|
| 4:25:37| and ridgetop protection area that has no trees on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15937)|
| 4:25:41| So they will be developing within that area but preserving the most heavily forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15941)|
| 4:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15948)|
| 4:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| That sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15954)|
| 4:25:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15955)|
| 4:25:57| So I'm just wanting to feel good about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| Looking at one of your drawings, it shows this tract of land, which is a big square, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15960)|
| 4:26:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15966)|
| 4:26:07| It's 50-some acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15967)|
| 4:26:10| And we're going to protect, actually going to place an easement on some of it to leave it alone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15970)|
| 4:26:19| Covenantly restrict it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| We haven't gone that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15981)|
| 4:26:23| Yeah, but that's what we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15983)|
| 4:26:25| If they come in with the concept plan that we've talked about, there probably is no need to put an easement on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15985)|
| 4:26:35| We've been trying to allow for space for a greenway up along Hickory Creek Road rather than up on the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=15995)|
| 4:26:44| which is really a collection of hummocks rather than a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16004)|
| 4:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16007)|
| 4:26:48| So then the 2.8 per acre, 50 acres worth, is then going to be sort of bunched up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16008)|
| 4:26:58| Yeah, the plan that we have been talking about has the greatest density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16018)|
| 4:27:04| the smallest lots down on the flat part of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16024)|
| 4:27:07| And as the development proceeds up the slope, the lots get bigger and the streets get skinnier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16027)|
| 4:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16033)|
| 4:27:14| So what has happened is that we've taken something that was envisioned to be advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16034)|
| 4:27:21| and between MPC and the, I'll say, property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16041)|
| 4:27:26| come up with a development that fits two people working together, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16046)|
| 4:27:33| I just wanted to make sure I was understanding what was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16053)|
| 4:27:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16059)|
| 4:27:40| And thank you also, Mr. Biddle, for being willing to hear a significant theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16060)|
| 4:27:50| that we have within the community about development of hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16070)|
| 4:27:54| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16074)|
| 4:27:55| Do you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16075)|
| 4:27:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16076)|
| 4:27:57| I would just like to thank these guys for working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16077)|
| 4:28:00| They actually presented some things to us that were very helpful for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16080)|
| 4:28:04| So we really appreciate their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16084)|
| 4:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16086)|
| 4:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16088)|
| 4:28:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16089)|
| 4:28:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16090)|
| 4:28:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16091)|

| 4:28:14| Thank you, Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16094)|

| 4:28:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16122)|
| 4:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16125)|
| 4:28:46| We're back to a few of our we still had a few discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16126)|
| 4:28:51| Mr. Hammond said that it was not necessary to talk about PRONOVA and the Blounton County thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16131)|
| 4:28:58| No, we'll do that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16138)|
| 4:29:00| We'll do that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16140)|
| 4:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16141)|
| 4:29:02| So we can shed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16142)|
| 4:29:06| Audit Committee report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16146)|
| 4:29:09| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16149)|
| 4:29:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16150)|
| 4:29:11| The Audit Committee met last Wednesday, and we had, I guess, roughly a three-and-a-half-hour meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16151)|
| 4:29:16| And the purpose of the meeting was to interview potential outside vendors to move this outsourcing situation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16156)|
| 4:29:27| Internal Audit Committee to see if we wanted to go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16167)|
| 4:29:32| KPMG, a big international company, used to audit the county's books up until about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16172)|
| 4:29:39| Pew & Company, who does it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16179)|
| 4:29:44| Ackward & Williams, a company out of the Tri-Cities area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16184)|
| 4:29:48| They have a much smaller shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16188)|
| 4:29:50| They audit Greenville, and the biggest customer they have is Washington County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16190)|
| 4:29:56| which would be roughly a pair of hours, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16196)|
| 4:29:59| Much smaller, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16199)|
| 4:30:01| And Richard Walls, also, he is the fourth candidate he interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16201)|
| 4:30:06| Of course, he's interviewing to replace himself, I guess, for lack of a better terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16206)|
| 4:30:14| But it was just an informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16214)|
| 4:30:19| We interviewed these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16219)|
| 4:30:20| We did not evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16220)|
| 4:30:22| That will be done on March the 5th, and I welcome any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16222)|
| 4:30:26| Commissioner Wright, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16226)|
| 4:30:28| I didn't favor one over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16228)|
| 4:30:30| We just had them walk in, and all of them were very qualified, as, of course, Richard is very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16230)|
| 4:30:38| Mr. Chairman, thank you, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16238)|
| 4:30:41| The bids from three people for this internal auditing, which is performed right now by the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16241)|
| 4:30:51| or county employee, some of the stuff that was brought up may not lend itself to us having an internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16251)|
| 4:31:02| done by an external firm, especially the external firm that does the annual external audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16262)|
| 4:31:15| In other words, would it be a conflict of interest for the external auditor to also be the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16275)|
| 4:31:24| And there's a way of describing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16284)|
| 4:31:27| I think Mr. Shouse and I probably agree that it's just a level of trust, but it may not be something that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16287)|
| 4:31:37| One of the other groups that bid on the contract is from Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16297)|
| 4:31:41| And when we, all of a sudden, commission, decide to charge the audit committee to go do some kind of internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16301)|
| 4:31:52| we may need a little bit better response and organizational knowledge than a firm that's in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16312)|
| 4:32:00| And that was a huge firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16320)|
| 4:32:03| The third bidding party was from Upper East Tennessee, a smaller firm, but engaged in a lot of governmental audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16323)|
| 4:32:15| But still, yet, they're a little bit removed from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| And I don't know that I got a good feel from them that they really knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16338)|
| 4:32:23| They described more external auditing of the county than they described internal auditing of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16343)|
| 4:32:33| The only reason I ran around that tree is for this very fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16353)|
| 4:32:38| We occasionally asked the internal auditor to go do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16358)|
| 4:32:45| We just need to make sure that we commission, charge the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16365)|
| 4:32:49| with a little bit more specificity in what it is we'd like to have looked at so that we can retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16369)|
| 4:32:55| and maintain a little bit of financial responsibility within the organization that we've got set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16375)|
| 4:33:03| In other words, I think that ever how many thousand dollars we're spending right now, probably well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16383)|
| 4:33:10| We probably would be spending more money if we went outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16390)|
| 4:33:15| But if we look at what we audit internally, we may be fairly well off where we reside right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16395)|
| 4:33:22| I'm not saying that in earshot of Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16402)|
| 4:33:27| I'm just saying that we met about it, had a review of those bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16407)|
| 4:33:32| and I don't know where those bids are going to be left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16412)|
| 4:33:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16415)|
| 4:33:37| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16417)|
| 4:33:39| Just for so everybody will know the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16419)|
| 4:33:42| it's a slightly over a quarter of a million dollar shop that Mr. Walls operates, 265 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16422)|
| 4:33:49| And bottom line, if we could feel comfortable thinking we got that same productivity for less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16429)|
| 4:33:56| or additional productivity for the same money, then maybe we should look in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16436)|
| 4:34:01| But I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16441)|
| 4:34:03| There are lots of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16443)|
| 4:34:06| KPMG being in Atlanta, I think they do have some people here, but he's right, they're based in Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16446)|
| 4:34:11| so they couldn't react quickly possibly as we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16451)|
| 4:34:15| There's a lot of other things for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16455)|
| 4:34:17| And, of course, if the audit committee were to recommend it, then it would come to this body to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16457)|
| 4:34:24| There's several steps that have to happen before we would fully outsource that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16464)|
| 4:34:31| A good point he made about Mr. Walls presented some documents that they were editorialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16471)|
| 4:34:40| They weren't factual, but they were editorializations by accounting manuals that should be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16480)|
| 4:34:50| that said the external auditor shouldn't be the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16490)|
| 4:34:54| That was a very good point he brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16494)|
| 4:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16497)|
| 4:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16498)|
| 4:34:59| Ms. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16499)|
| 4:35:00| I don't have anything on this, but I have an announcement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16503)|
| 4:35:04| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16504)|
| 4:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16506)|
| 4:35:07| Go ahead, Ms. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16507)|
| 4:35:08| I just wanted to remind everybody that tomorrow night J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16508)|
| 4:35:11| and I are having a meeting about the potential safety center at six o'clock at the auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16511)|
| 4:35:18| at the health department on Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16518)|
| 4:35:20| And I would appreciate as many of you coming as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16520)|
| 4:35:25| I hope it will be a good discussion among community members there in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16525)|
| 4:35:32| And, hopefully, I think also some of our city council counterparts are planning to be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16532)|
| 4:35:38| So, hopefully, it will be a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16538)|
| 4:35:40| And I would appreciate as many of you as possible coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16540)|
| 4:35:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16546)|
| 4:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16547)|
| 4:35:48| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16548)|
| 4:35:49| Run for the schools, 5K, at Chilhowee Park, Saturday morning, 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16549)|
| 4:35:54| It's a challenging course and everyone that supports the schools ought to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16554)|
| 4:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16562)|
| 4:36:03| Any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16563)|
| 4:36:04| Seeing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=16564)|
