| 1:58:02| I would much rather see this be C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| And, you know, it will be on the agenda in two weeks, and we can reconsider it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| And I think we should reconsider it with some clarity from Mr. Donaldson about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| I'm willing to go ahead and make the move then, I guess, probably in favor of it now, especially after what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7096)|
| 1:58:24| And it sounds like we're going to be able to work it out down the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| But I was a little concerned about some folks' positions on the C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| And if we came back here in two weeks, you know, we are in a bad spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| But, you know, I sense that maybe we're going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| So in order to move it along so that you can go ahead and move along, I'm going to probably change and go with the C-6 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| With my objection, with my points I stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I'll second that motion, but with great reservation, because I think I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| For the record, that's not actually my intention to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| She's supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| Let her do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Mark is just saying he's changed his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| The motion was already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| I was thinking, Vice Mayor Brown was making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| But, you know, I expressed earlier the position that Mr. Newbert in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| And I'm also, like Vice Mayor Brown, very uncomfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| And I just want to remind everyone of the situation that we've kind of created by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| And I'll go along with that in good faith, but I'm looking you all right in the eyeballs now and saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| we have put this gentleman and this council in a very unusual position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| We'll vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| We'll go back to roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7181)|

| 2:00:03| Mr. Newbert, I think what you heard as a council, it very much sympathizes with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| but it's also concerned about long-term implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| That's just a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| Now we need to vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7210)|

| 2:00:21| We're sorry for everybody for taking so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| but I think what you hear is people worried about 25 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7223)|

| 2:03:33| Mr. Boyce McCall is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7413)|
| 2:03:47| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you, Mayor Ashe and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| I'm Boyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| I live at 4710 Washington Park here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| I've lived here for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| I come for one reason and then another one developed when you began to discuss the storm water system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7440)|
| 2:04:09| you're going to sue the county and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| But my problem is that I have been renting you my property for the last, well, since April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7452)|
| 2:04:25| I've been sending you invoices for using my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| and the sum is a connection fee to my storm water sewer system of $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7471)|
| 2:04:42| Then I have been charging you $1,500 a month since April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7482)|
| 2:04:51| which brings into account April, May, June, July, August, and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| And now we're going into October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| And I want you to pay this bill because you're using my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| You owe me for being on my property using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| And I would like for you to put that on a workshop or do whatever you have to do to prevent us from having to go to court again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7512)|
| 2:05:22| Now, this past August 30th, the court rendered an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7522)|
| 2:05:30| And I might read to you the last section of the court's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| The court has issued or is in the process of issuing you an injunction, which he clearly states here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7538)|
| 2:05:49| The court will enter a judgment restraining and enjoining the city of Knoxville accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7549)|
| 2:05:57| from flooding the property of Boyce McCall and Joella McCall at Johnston Street at three different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7557)|
| 2:06:08| Now, today I got inundated with more water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| Sewer is in my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| I hear you talking to these Russians and these other people about justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| You get awards for what you do in Lonsdale, but you don't fix the sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| I would be ashamed if I were any one of you council people for putting your, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7588)|
| 2:06:39| into the streets and the streams of this city and especially in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| Now, this court order is going to be enforced against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| And I don't care whether you appeal it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| There's not a whole lot to appeal from because he's been very specific on all the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| He has condemned you people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| You are guilty of violating not only my property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| but you're guilty of violating a Tennessee statute which prohibits you from dispensing your sewer into my basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7626)|
| 2:07:17| and into my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| Now, you can make light of it, but the next step is I'm going to take some action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7640)|
| 2:07:30| not only to collect this money you owe me, but to get you probably in contempt of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| Now, the law director sitting through this trial, he knows we proved our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| And, Ms. Pelo, I'll never forget what you indicated when I asked you to keep that sewer out of my yard where my grandbabies had to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7664)|
| 2:07:54| I met with you and some of you others and Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7674)|
| 2:08:00| I sued each one of you, and you beat me in sessions course, which wasn't very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| But when you got downtown to the chancellery court, you lost big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| And I want you to know that we don't appreciate being treated like third world people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7693)|
| 2:08:25| the way that you people conduct this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| We're entitled to have a clean environment, even though we're in Lonsdale trying to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7709)|
| 2:08:37| And each one of you can go home tonight and know you're convicted already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| You're convicted of violating the rights of not only my family but the people of Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7722)|
| 2:08:50| by not allowing them to have a clean environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| You spend all this money up here on a Tennessee theater, and the mayor spends $2 million up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7734)|
| 2:09:01| trying to have a nice place to go watch a movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| When you're flooding Lonsdale with sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| 30 more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| That's the end of it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Mr. Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7753)|
| 2:09:23| You helping, Mr. Anderson? You helping flood the general property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| Well, sure I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| Alonzo Montgomery, Nantzville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Mr. Mayor, I just want to remind you all, you got re-elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| I'm still waiting on Harrison and Louise to get their sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| It's only been 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| During your re-election bid, engineers got with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| Man, they was ready to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| I mean, since you got re-elected, they done slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| I want to make sure that he's not going to get some of that sidewalk money before it all gets gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| So I hope that you don't forget about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| And then I have a question for Ms. Madeline over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| But I also want to know who got the paperwork on the sale of five points at Village Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Will City of Ricarda's office be having that paperwork since it really wasn't Leroy Thompson's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| It was city taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| Or will it be community development so I know where to get the transactions so I can read it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| And then I also want to know what y'all really plan on doing with the land down there on State Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| when y'all get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| I was sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| I've been being low-key since I always do that during election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| But I was sitting there thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| I said, man, we can't even fill the bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| I know all of you say, Mr. Mayor, that convention center, you're never going to gain money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| It was never built for a big profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| So what's the big problem about getting a 100-bed hotel or suite down there on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| when we're not filling all the beds in the city in the hotels that we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| You know, I don't understand it, but I'm sure you'll figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| But I really want to know about where I can get that information on that five-point project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| I definitely want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| I don't like dealing with your secretary, point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| You know, I don't mind coming up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| And I'm coming because I also want to know about what's going on with Tarrant Key 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| We didn't say it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Before they just turn that property over to that church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I think every resident that lives in that community ought to be notified that y'all plan to make this transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7885)|
| 2:11:33| No one's being notified, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| And then I want to know what happened to that big screen TV that was up there in that doggone building, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| I want to know who got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I know who got it, but I want them to come forth and tell me they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| You know, so that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| I know your back hurts, Mr. Mayor, but I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Y'all have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| I want to know, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Before we adjourn, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Mr. Montgomery, property transactions are recorded in the Knox County Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| You can see Nick McBride, Sherry Wood, or Steve Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| Depending on what day it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| Thank you, and we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7928)|
