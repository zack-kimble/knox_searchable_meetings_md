| 0:00:21| And, Commissioner Hammond, I think it's your turn today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=21)|

| 0:00:44| Okay, Commissioners, you've had your minutes that were sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Do I hear a motion that we approve the December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| First from Commissioner Strickland and Hammond second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| I would like to, we don't have it on our agenda today, but I'd like to have some discussion on the handout that I left at each one of your desks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=61)|
| 0:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| The Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| After the conclusion of our applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| We should have time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| Anything else need to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| Law Director, we'll go ahead and do our swearing in for those that are going to testify today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| For everyone who's going to testify, please stand, raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Each of you swear or affirm that the testimony you give in this matter today be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Our first application, Ora Mae Cotter, if you want to, at Anne's Choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Clerk, if you want to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| This is for Anne's Choice at 8310 Asheville Highway for off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| I don't think she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Ora Mae Cotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| There's been a motion to postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Do you know what the deal is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| I think her mother is the applicant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| I was up there the day before yesterday, and she said that she was going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| It's the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| From what I've found, I guess we ought to probably, if she don't show up before it's over, not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=161)|
| 0:02:58| Did you make a motion to defer it, Tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| I said defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| We'll take action probably when we're done with that one, I guess, UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| Item number six, read for the record, and then we'll explain that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Clerk, I'll explain what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| This is item 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| It's an application for Doogee Enterprise at RNA Shells, 6730 Clinton Highway, off-premises formerly Shell Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| Commissioner, we have found after the application, or after the agenda was done, this was within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| so this is a city applicant, and the money has already been refunded to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| so it's one that we don't have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Do we need to take any action on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Just verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| The next 6B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| This is a request for Fox Express Inc. at 1116 Harvey Road for off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| Sir, would you state your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Robert Seals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Mr. Seals, before we jump into this, let me ask you a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| It looks like that you are zoned PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Has there been a business here before that sold beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Your zoning concerns me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:46| Your zoning concerns me a little bit because of the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=286)|
| 0:05:03| How many acres do you have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| Give me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| You know, what I read in our zoning code is that you can have a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| which is what this would be in a PR zone so long as you have 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:49| Is this the only business that you have located on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Tell me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| I mean, is it something that you've just built, you just constructed, or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| When we applied for a building permit, it was my understanding that county code allowed for one acre of commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| to be placed at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| We're doing a convenience store, gas station, Godfather's Pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:41| You know, currently in a PR zone, you can have a planned unit development occupying not less than 20 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:52| where one acre of commercial use is permitted for each 100 units in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| provided that 25% of the total units proposed shall be ready for occupancy, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=418)|
| 0:07:07| I can't find where this is permitted in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:36| In order to build your facility there, did you go through MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Did they give you a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Of course, he's not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Right, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| Yeah, see, I think you're going to need to have it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| You know, currently, even in a general business zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| you can't have an establishment that sells beer, at least for consumption on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| We don't have that regulation for one that is for off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| But if you were going to sell it on-premise, you couldn't be located within 500 feet of any residential or agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:36| There is no on-premise consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Right, it's all off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| You know, before we can get into this today, but before we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| we need to find out if you're properly zoned, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And I have a real serious question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| We need to get with MPC and see what all it is that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| I see that through our Knox County Codes Enforcement, as of December 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| they didn't find that there was a zoning conflict with your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| but I have a serious question about that because it doesn't appear to be a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| Bruce, can you enlighten me on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| As of December 17, when Kim took a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| she didn't find that there was a conflict with the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| It doesn't look like that this is a use that's permitted for one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| If I'm not mistaken, I think the Planning Commission does have the authority to approve limited commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| in conjunction with a planned residential zone, but it would have had to have been on a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| So what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Was there a use-on-review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| That's what we need to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| And I think Kim Ayler, I know she's out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| we'll just need to check and see if a use-on-review is actually approved for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| If he actually pulled a building permit for the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| I can imagine us not following through and making sure a use-on-review is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I move we postpone this for 30 days, pending this new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| We're going to need to postpone it until the next meeting so we can check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| That way we're all not spinning our wheels and you're not wasting your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Mr. Law Director, what are his options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| He would need to get the land rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| If it has not gone through the use-on-review procedure, and we don't know that because the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| they would have done a report and noticed it and all that and voted on it at their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| and we don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| But he would need to go through those steps, and they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| He indicates that they've gone through MPC, but I haven't seen any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| So basically I guess I'm asking, he does have some options if indeed the zoning is not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| So he could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| So you do have some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| He does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So, John, when you find out, will you call him or he needs to call MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| I'll talk with MPC and see what it is that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| So we'll be ready for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| And you may want to do the same and get copies of their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you, Mr. Seals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| You might want to bring the owner with you, too, next time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| It would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Let me ask, and then Commissioner Strickland will get with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| While we're on this, do we need, Mr. Law Director, do we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| would it help us to have, then, maps, then, of these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| You know, we could have seen that on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Well, what we need to see is what went before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| and to make sure that he did go, that they did go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| He believes that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And, you know, each time one of these comes up and it's a zone that's questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| we just need to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| But if you would, sir, check on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| And you can call my office and ask for me, John Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| And my number is 215-2327.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| What about just having maps just so we know, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| Kingston Park is a long street, Manowar Highway is a long street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Asheville Highway is long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Is that too much trouble for who prepares, the clerk's office or who prepares for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| Oh, a map of the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Just the MPC mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Mr. Chairman, I have one in hand if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| Well, I'm talking about for everything in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| that when we're looking we can sort of put landmarks together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| because like I say, Kingston Park is such a long street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Kim says they're submitted to codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| The applications and all that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| We can work on getting at least a map for the board to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| That way you'll be able to see where this location is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Commissioner Strickland, I think you had an item you wanted to bring before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Bruce, have you got a report on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I just went ahead and called Kim Ehler, who's the codes inspector that was working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| She said she has checked with the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| and as far as zoning is concerned, he's in total compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| If that's the case, you know, why don't we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| you want to go ahead and act on it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Let me go ahead and take this gentleman through the series of testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| and then go ahead and act on it, and then it will be subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| I would ask that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| That way you might not have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| State your name again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Robert Seals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Mr. Seals, have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Beer has not been sold here before, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| There's no outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| This is for off-premise consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| No, I'm a general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| You're a general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Two owners, Manpreet Singh and Mark Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And so the business name is Fox Express, and you're the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Do you rent from those persons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Tell us the arrangement that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I handle all their management aspects as far as hiring employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| doing this kind of paperwork to get the establishment started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So Mr. Singh and the others, they own Fox Express, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| You're going to be the person operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| And are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| and do you agree to conduct this business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=928)|

| 0:15:32| I have made arrangements to attend a class on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=932)|

| 0:15:40| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Sheriff's department report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Beer board inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| I've got no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Bruce, we've got the letter from Kim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| and Bruce just stated that it has gone through the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=954)|

| 0:16:17| I'll make a motion we approve pending the reports from the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=977)|

| 0:16:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And we're waiting on your aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| That'll save you a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| That's good then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| And, UK, you've got something you want to talk about too, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Commissioner Strickland, you had an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I'll put before you the Tennessee's Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| I guess before I get started, I must disclose that I am on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| I represent the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I'm not on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I represent him on the legislative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| and also the executive committee of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| The Tennessee's Responsible Vendors Act, which I know a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| but Katherine Brunson is here to guide us through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| What it is, it's a sunset law that the state of Tennessee is getting ready to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| I don't know, Mr. Law Director, if we decide to act on this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| would it take the full body of the commission just for a recommendation from the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| The beer board can certainly make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| but it would be up to the commission then to pass a resolution recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| what you're wanting to do is to recommend that the law not sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I'd like to give the rest of my time to Katherine Brunson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| I think we spoke a little bit last year about the Tennessee's Responsible Vendors Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| when it went into effect, and it was only provided for one year to take a look at it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| I think the question came up, and we've discussed it in our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| and they're going to be discussing it at the next city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| is that there are concerns by, I don't think the Tennessee Municipal League has taken a full stance yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| but there are concerns locally that it ties your hands a little bit in what you're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| And so I think what Commissioner Strickland was asking about is in our last board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| we had some policy discussions on issues that we might like to address on behalf of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| and we're trying to get some input from city council and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| as to whether or not you had issues with the Tennessee Responsible Vendors Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I think based upon the feedback we got from city council is they were a little hesitant to have it reauthorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1136)|
| 0:19:06| in its current form, and I believe are going to be sending a resolution asking that it not be reauthorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| I think at this time Senator McNally and Representative Dean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| although the legislation was getting ready to be reauthorized, have put it on hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| because of concerns they're hearing around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And so I think what we were asking is just if I can answer any questions regarding the Responsible Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| if you have any concerns amongst yourself, if it's passed in the same form that it is in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| I think the question that really stands out right now is we have no certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| and I have to be careful how I say this, we don't have anyone certified as a Responsible Vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I don't want to say we don't have Responsible Vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| We don't have anyone certified as a Responsible Vendor in East Tennessee at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| What, eight, nine months into the program and there's still not anyone certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| which leaves a lot of question marks in gray area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| We don't know exactly how it's going to act out until it's tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| But I think the concern at this time is if you're someone that does have one and two violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| that you can pay your little fee and you do have a lesser sentencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| if you get another underage drinking violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| I think our concern is it's removed from your hands what you can deal out as a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| or revocation or administrative fine locally once they become Responsible Vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| Answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| It would be up to the vendor to become the Responsible Vendor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| They pay a fee and go through a training and then they're certified as Responsible Vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| So as far as punishment goes, it's really to their advantage to become a Responsible Vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| but yet none have taken advantage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| At this time, I don't want to speak for the ABC, but it is my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| it hasn't been offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| They've not had the capacity to offer the training in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| It's just now starting in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| It's taking a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I know we sent letters notifying, oh, gosh, every establishment in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| I think they're just now getting their agents trained to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| How many people do we have that sell beer in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| 253.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| 253?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| People that sell beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Less than 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Is it less than 200 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I thought it was around 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I've got a question for both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| I may be misunderstanding this, and if I am, please correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| It looks to me like, now, if a person becomes a responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| do they pay the fee to Knox County or to the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| To the ABC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| $35 fee, I think it is, and the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and then if you get sanctioned on one, two, or three violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| it's a much softer outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| This, it doesn't sound like a very good idea for Knox County to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| because it sounds almost like if they'll pay a fee to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| that it limits their ability to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| limits the amount of fines that we can charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| It just doesn't seem like a good idea to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Does anybody else see it the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| You think it's a good thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| We discussed it in the Metropolitan Drug Commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Well, see, I haven't seen the, is the education program that comes with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| is it going to reduce violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| My understanding, it's going to be a little bit like your tips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| or your ask server training type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:22| So the question really I think that we were posing was to get a gauge of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| or not you wanted to see it reauthorized, and if so, in the same form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| I don't know enough about it, and I would concede to Mr. Strickland's wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| but just knee jerk, it just looked to me like that if it limited the amount of fines that we could collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| and we weren't the ones that were collecting the money for the Responsible Vendors Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| it just looked like it wasn't a good economic proposition for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| But if you tell me that the education programs that come with it are worth giving up the ability to set our own fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:09| then like I said, I'll trust you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| I can economically say, you're right, that's less money in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| I cannot speak to the validity of the education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I have not seen it, nor has anyone in East Tennessee at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| I don't think it gives up the ability for us to levy fines, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Not to levy fines, but they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| You will be limited by the state as imposed what those fines will be once they're a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| And so you can't supersede the state legislation, which will impose a smaller fine than what you currently charge in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:46| I mean, that's what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| But if they've got such a good program that it's going to help keep alcohol out of the hands of minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| and possibly save lives, then, you know, I'm all for saving lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| But just on the surface, my knee jerk reaction is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| it looks like the state gets the money for the responsible vendor program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| and then the state limits us, you know, on the amount of fines that we can charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| And I guess what I'm saying is that from where I'm sitting, of course, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| I do realize this is not my field of expertise, but from where I'm sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| it looks like we're letting the state collect these monies, and then it limits their monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| In fact, it reminds me of buying a penance under the medieval Catholic church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| But like I said, I may be totally off base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It's our feeling when I say our, the Metropolitan Drug Commission and some partners in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| is our feeling that it weakens our efforts to combat underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| So would you say that this is not a good proposition for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| I'm not real thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Well, I mean, that's the way it looks to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| You know, there have been two instances in the last year that there's been such egregious acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| that city council went above what they normally do and at two times said, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| we've got to take these folks out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| That's not a choice for you anymore under this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Is there anything that we can do to, so basically what we need to do or what would be best for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| is if we ask our legislative, our legislators on the state level to let this sunset and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:47| I believe, I don't want to speak on behalf of the city, but I believe that is what the city is going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Well, that sounds like what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Do you need more time to research it yourself to feel comfortable with it or are you satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| If I can answer questions, I mean, you know, I have to just speak on behalf of my organization when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| we're not real thrilled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I don't ever like limiting local power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| You know, you just need to take things on a case-by-case example, I think, in a court of law or anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| And when it limits that, you know, I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I cannot speak on behalf of the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I do not know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I guess that's what I was looking for is I was looking for a compelling reason to think that the Responsible Vendor Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| was a good thing, and for lack of a compelling reason, it looks to me like it limits our power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| and looks like something that Knox County would be better off if this were not renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| And I'll certainly be making some calls, and anything you guys want to do as a body, if we want to send a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| or send it before a full commission, I'll, you know, I'd definitely support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Catherine, what we voted on in the Metropolitan Drug Commission was to let we want it to sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1692)|

| 0:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| I need you to respond to these questions, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| You might need to push the mic in front of you where you can talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1940)|

| 0:32:57| Having a little hard time communicating today, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=1977)|

| 0:33:25| Ms. Haynes, are you the daughter or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| If you would sit down, please, and let me talk to your mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:40| Okay, Ms. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2020)|

| 0:33:50| Well, no, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Me and her, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| Ms. Haynes, so the two of you own the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Does anybody else have an interest in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Who is it that's going to operate the business, your daughter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Now, you know that your daughter has been convicted of, as I take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:36| laws against possession, sale, and manufacture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| or transportation of intoxicating liquor, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| What was your daughter convicted of a couple of years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Drinking, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I don't know, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| If the answer is that she has been convicted of these crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| then she would not be able to be a participant in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| And what you're telling me is that you and your daughter are co-owners of the business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Ms. Haynes, do you want to come back up to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:28| Ms. Haynes, tell us what it was that you were convicted for and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| I don't remember the date exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I think it was in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| September of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| September of 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I can't really remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| I think it was about two and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I can't really remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| That's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Sheriff's Department, do you have any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| Her name wasn't on the application and I only ran information on a background check on her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| because Ms. Haynes' name wasn't on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| It sounds like Ms. Haynes' name has been left off the application and it needs to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| It's not part of my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| She don't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| It's her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I help her with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| She don't understand what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Well, I don't understand what your answers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I'm just trying to ask straightforward questions and get straightforward answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| I don't have any money in it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I just help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Beer Board Inspector, do you have any information in addition to what's been said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| Yes, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| We answered a complaint called, Lieutenant and myself, in October the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| This lady was behind the counter with a city beer license hanging on the wall and two beer cases full of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2213)|
| 0:37:05| You're talking about Ms. Haynes or Ms. Cotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Ms. Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| And when I asked her, she says, well, what's wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| I'm not violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I've got a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| And I told her it was the city's beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| And we took the beer license down, called the city, and they come and got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:33| We made her lock the beer up, and then she applied for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| When I got the application, I checked with Mr. Bill Fox that owns the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| and he said Ms. Haynes is the one that rented the property from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| And I've done that on November the 27th at 10 a.m. in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2274)|
| 0:38:06| Ms. Haynes, do you rent the property from Mr. Fox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I'm the one that called Mr. Fox because I was at work the day that someone told me about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| My mother had had a heart attack after we got the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| And we moved from there to the other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| But I hadn't sold no beer to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I still had the city beer license still in the same frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| But I hadn't sold no beer because I had called the beer people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| They told me I could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| We had to apply for another license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| And I think the competition up the road is the one that's trying to put us out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| I don't know anything about your competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| I'm just trying to figure out who's applying for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| All right, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Yes, I would like to have an opportunity to run Ms. Haynes as a background check owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| because if she's been convicted of an alcohol-related charge in the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| we couldn't approve a license for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| And, I mean, what I'm hearing is, and, you know, the board can tell me if we need to ask any further questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| but what I'm hearing is that Ms. Haynes is certainly involved with the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| Ms. Cotter says that she and her daughter run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I'm not sure what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| We're going to need to see, I would think, some documentation which shows who really owns the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| who rents it, your lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| We need to see some documentation of who it is that really needs to apply for this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| In addition to that, the Sheriff's Department needs to run a check on Ms. Haynes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| since she apparently is very involved with the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| So my recommendation would be to defer it until the next meeting to give the Sheriff's Department the opportunity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| and to give Ms. Haynes and Ms. Cotter the opportunity to prove who it is that owns and leases the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:25| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Commissioner Law Director, could we deny this and let them start from scratch with the other lady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| I think based upon the record that you have before you, denial would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:48| We don't really have clear testimony as to who really owns the business, as to who's running it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| as to really who is seeking the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| I just think from what I've heard today, I'm going to move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| I believe that the application was incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| It should have contained both names, and if we deny it, then you're welcome to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| That wouldn't keep them from starting all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| They can start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Then start all over again, put both of your names on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| I feel like the staff here has practiced due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| They've checked the name that was on the application when, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| there's actually two names that should have been on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| So I'm moving that we deny this and start from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and I hope you'll put the correct information on the next application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| There's been a motion for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Ms. Haynes, just try again next month if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| Staff, we appreciate you all, your due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Anything else come before us at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Law Director, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| There's been a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Clerk, if you'll go ahead and call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:47| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Okay, we have all members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Clerk, you can go to the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Mr. Chairman, members, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:27| Items, one is item 12D07SP and 12J07RZ on my agenda, the preliminary agenda, that would be at page 22 and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:46| It's a request to Dutch Town Land Partners for sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| We would request a postponement to the next meeting of county commission on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| Okay, does anybody have an objection to postponing that to our next meeting, those two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Could you repeat the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It's 12D07SP and 12J07RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| And then I have one other item that's coming around to me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| I thought I had another item, but I find that last month we postponed it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| All right, can you go over those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I still hear some people trying to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| Page 22, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| The bottom one on page 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| That's the request of Dutch Town for sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| And the first one on page 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| The first one at the top of page 23, which are the ones that I discussed with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| Yeah, there's some, that whole area, that Dutch Town, there's some sinkholes that is natural drainage for that entire Cedar Bluff area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:08| and we need to make sure that whatever happens out that way, we're very careful not to disturb those sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| although we've been in a drought for the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| When it does rain, it has a tendency to flood, and sometimes flood very heavily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and we have to close Cedar Bluff Road, and we have to close Dutch Town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| And so we need to be very careful out there before we approve anything along Dutch Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| After I talked to Commissioner Leuthold, I attempted to contact the engineer so we could get some more engineering detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| and data on it so we could respond to his concerns or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| and haven't yet had that opportunity to fully explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Thirty days will give us that chance so we can get back to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| If we don't have any objections, we'll defer these to our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:06| I think we're on the top of page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Request that the Fuller Group for a northwest county sector plan amendment from A-RR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Agricultural Rural Residential, to LDR, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| Property located on the southeast side of Hickory Creek Road, southeast of West Gallagher Ferry Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Arthur Seymour, Jr., on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| This one and the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2792)|

| 0:49:58| Yes, I have a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| And if you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| My name is Waneser Rugebi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I am 4909 War Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| The question is about the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| What type of accommodations do you have for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Well, we just right now we are rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| When we have a site plan, we will try to work with the county engineer and fulfill all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Buzz, do you have some comments about that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| Do you have a description of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Commissioner, what we've recommended for approval is maintenance of the slope protection area on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| and then approval of the General Business District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| This gives an indication to those that will review the site plans that the slope protection area needs to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| And hopefully that will be done at the plan review stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| The CA General Business Zone is already prevalent along that stretch of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| So from that standpoint, it was deemed to be an appropriate land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| The size of the property doesn't really make it suitable for any kind of plan zone that you could possibly put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| It's a little more than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| So we feel comfortable that the slope that is there is going to be protected through the site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| What percent slope are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Give me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Let's see if I can indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| And how much excavation of that said slope is going to be necessary for your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| The lot is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| It's probably about four feet higher than the Hardin Valley road right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:55| Commissioner, as I recall, even though this is deemed a slope protection area, that designation is pretty general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| And what we do when we have a situation like that is take a look at a more specific slope analysis map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| And as I recall, it didn't appear that their slope really that it was that significant on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| even though we showed it in a general fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| We show that to make sure that we understand when site plans do come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| or when rezonings are requested that we may have an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| As I recall in this case, and we would have included a slope protection map if a substantial part of the site was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:40| in detail affected by steep or moderate slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3163)|

| 0:54:23| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Request of Forest Brook Development for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| Property located on the north side of Badgett Road, east side of Tools Bend Road in the fourth commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| That's going to be the fourth district, but we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Motion made by Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Seconded by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Seconded by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| I note in the record of this that there is some neighborhood opposition, a reference to slope problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| and also a reference to site distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Could we address each of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Because that could stand in the way of a successful thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| I'll try to address those in sort of a summary fashion, if I may, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| I think those are perhaps two issues at least among those questions raised at the time of meeting at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| Subsequent to that MPC meeting, my client had occasion to meet with a number of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| In addition to that, he has submitted a concept plan in use on review to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| that shows how the developments occur that dealt with a number of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| That matter was taken up at MPC earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| There was no opposition, and that development plan was approved on the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| So I think really all their issues got pretty much addressed through the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| and the concept plan that got submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| There were an additional couple of points about leaving a fence that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| making sure that we left it there, et cetera, which we agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Specifically the concerns by Mr. Luke Webber, Mr. Evans, have they been satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| I know they're not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| As far as I know, the answer to that would be yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| based on the fact that they didn't appear, didn't have any questions with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| and they haven't appeared here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I haven't personally talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| But I know that my client has talked to a number of the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| I'm just not sure who all he talked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:54| Commissioner Harmon, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Yes, I am, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Request of Butler Homes and Construction LLC for a southwest county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| from LDR low density residential and SLPA slope protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| to MDR medium density residential and slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| Property located on the northwest side of Gleason Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| northeast of Ebenezer Road in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| And the next one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| This is also for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And the property is also located on the northwest side of Gleason Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| northeast of Ebenezer Road in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Mr. Chairman, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Briar Glen Subdivision contacted me the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| They would like a postponement, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Mr. King and I have talked briefly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I don't think we're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Well, ordinarily, you know, it's hard to oppose postponements perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| but we would really like to go forward on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Before this rezoning got started, my client had sent an e-mail to the officer of the homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:35| inviting them to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| He expressed interest in appearing at any meeting that the association might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| He really didn't get a response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| As you well know, we went forward at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| Until now, there hasn't been a suggestion that there's any purpose for a delay or further matters to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3531)|
| 0:59:01| Lastly, I would observe that what we're asking for is to rezone this property to a planned residential classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| And a lot of issues or questions that the people in the neighborhood may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| can certainly be addressed through that continuing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| In other words, we're going to have to be back in front of MPC with a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| use on review approval process, et cetera, and ultimately, at somebody's behest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| maybe an appearance before the Board of Zoning Appeals of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| I would think that that would afford sufficient opportunity to discuss any of the issues that are related to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:49| We would much prefer it to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I think all of us recognize that delays in projects at this point in time is a dangerous step in view of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3592)|
| 1:00:03| We have all sorts of dynamics going on in the building industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| and the tightening of credit and the cost of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| We would really prefer to go forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:22| Fifth District, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| I'll be happy to let the gentleman speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| If you'll go ahead and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Yes, my name is Larry Liverman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I live in Briar Glen Subdivision, 8748 Heathwood Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| We are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| The MPC ruled in our favor to keep this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| We have no problem with allowing this to go from agricultural to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| I mean, we live in West Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| We live in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| We know that this is going to be, when you have a piece of vacant land in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| you're going to have a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| We have no problem with that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| What we're wanting to see is this development be something that matches our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| Our subdivision is a subdivision that was built 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| I mean, this was put in place 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Our average, if you look at our subdivision, we're probably about 1.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| We're kind of weird in West Knoxville, but there's a lot of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| Sheffield, I mean, there's a lot of subdivisions in West Knoxville just like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| What we're wanting to do is keep the development low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| And the MPC ruled in our favor of keeping it low density, not to exceed five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| What we're asking you all to do, what we're begging you all to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| is to keep it low density, not to exceed three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| But even if you would rule in favor of the MPC's recommendation of low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| we would appreciate that, and five units per acre, which would accent our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Our subdivision is a subdivision of probably half a million to a million and a half to our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| So we're just trying to get something that would blend in with our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Now, we have made numerous attempts prior to the MPC meeting, me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| I've sent emails to Mr. Butler of Butler Homes. He never responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| After the MPC meeting back in December, I met with Mr. Butler and the gentleman who inherited the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| back in this back office back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| And I told him, I said, look, we're willing to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| We know you're going to develop this land, but we just want it to be something harmonious with what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| And here I stand today, and I have not heard from Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| I personally gave him my cell phone number, my email address, my home phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| and my name is Larry Liverman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| If you look in the phone book, there's only one Liverman in the entire Knoxville phone book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| So I'm not trying to hide from this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| I have done nothing but try to present that our subdivision is willing to work with you if you'll work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:21| This gentleman has made no attempt to contact me via cell phone, via email, and via landline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:31| And I can document this no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| All I'm asking you all, all I'm asking the Knox County Commission to do is to please, please follow the advice of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:47| We have no problem allowing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| I have no problem with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I mean, I'm not going to lie, I'd love to look at a piece of green grass the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| That's not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| I bought a lot in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| I built a house in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| I raised my family in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I'm just asking you to please pass a resolution that will allow a development in sync with our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:18| We have done everything we can to work with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| And I'm a builder myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| And he has made no attempt to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| So what else, what else can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I mean, what else can I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| I mean, we're saying we welcome you to develop, but work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| They don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| So what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Ladies and gentlemen, if this was your property, what would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Okay, Commissioner Hammond, you still have the floor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| I've received a number of phone calls from the folks in Briar Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| I've received numerous e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| The fact that they have retained Mr. Seymour shows I believe that they do have some legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| I would like to make a motion that we postpone this until our next meeting to give them an opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| and to talk and to see if they can work this issue out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| The gentleman that came and spoke or Mr. King, you may answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| The subdivision you're talking about where you live, where do you live as to where this is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| Are you right directly behind it or beside it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Directly to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| To the north of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| You have Gleason Road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| If this right here, this piece of wood was Gleason Road, we'd come right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| You're behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| The subdivision that is in question, the developments in question, sir, would come right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| basically my rear property would be right against their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| Their rear property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| We would touch their rear property, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| The easiest way to explain it, Commissioner, is they're adjoining directly to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| One thing you need to keep in mind is how steeply sloped this piece of property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| and it comes right down to the bottom of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| I believe there's a ditch back there that has been eroding away over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| It was explained to me that it used to only be a couple of feet deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| and now you can't see someone's head if they stand in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Actually, if I may interject, being in construction and having a young son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:33| this erosion control has been dealt with very heavily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| but right now the ditch is 22 foot deep at the highest point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| And this piece of land behind us is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| And being a contractor, I mean, I'm surprised they want to develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| I mean, it is a very, very, very steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| But the ditch is a big safety concern for young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| So I think giving these, you know, both sides 30 days to see if they can come up with a compromise would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| The only thing I was going to say is I understand what the issue before you is a request for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| and I'm not going to bother to respond to the other matters discussed by the gentleman who was just at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| I'll wait and see what you do on the request for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| Can I say one thing, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| I understand this is out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Why has not the gentleman tried to work with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| That's on the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| We've got a motion on the floor to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Commissioner Lamb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| I think we need to hear this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I think they've come ready to present a case for this development, and I think we need to hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| Do you all want a postponement or do you want to hear it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| I'm talking to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:39| I'm not going to ask for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:48| As I said, Commissioner, obviously our preference is to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| I've been doing this an awful long time, and I understand where our opponents are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4132)|
| 1:09:02| I do not, and most of you have probably heard me say this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| I don't, I'm not often in a position of wanting to push to try to get something heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| where there are legitimate concerns being expressed by members of this body who have some questions or concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| While we believe that there's plenty of opportunity to deal with those if we went forward today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| in deference to the request, in deference to the interests of some of the members of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| we will not object to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Mr. King, we're looking at this density here, 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| Is that the absolute lowest that you guys can go on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Do you have any wiggle room there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| That's part of the problem is where this is headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| As with most ventures and most developments, there's a limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| and I have asked, I did not represent Mr. Butler at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| They asked for 6.5 dwelling units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Staff recommended it, pointing out that it was in keeping with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| in conformity with the other development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Right across the street from it is a condominium development at eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| Adjoining it immediately to the west, it's 6.5 units to the acre zone for 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| You know, their subdivision doesn't actually access Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| They access Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| And as he says, their boundary is, in essence, behind ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| I asked, when Mr. Butler contacted me, I asked him to get a sharper pencil out and go back and take a look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| I told Mr. Seymour today when he identified himself as being the person representing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| that we could live with 6.2 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| I understand that they find that unacceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| but, you know, maybe there may be some opportunity over the 30-day break to break that logjam, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| But I don't want to go away flying under any false flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| There is a limit to which we can go on this, or it just kills the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| And it's going to come back before MPC, what, use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| They'll come back before us, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| If it's rezoned plan residential, it will be back in front of MPC on a use on review and a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| As a matter of fact, I think it's already filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| It's already filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| It's filed and I think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| It was postponed at our January meeting to allow, because we knew that there was opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| to allow the rezoning issue to be settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| So it will be on our February agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I mean, I just, I've talked to other property owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Scott Davis owns some property close by and he has no problem with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| Well, he's a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Well, I mean, but I'm saying that he says it is compatible with what he's building in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| And if you drive up and down Gleason Road, that's all they're building out there is condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| Mr. Butler, it doesn't appear to me that he's asking for anything different than what is already going on in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| And also, if we're going to have a, if we're going to preserve any of the outlying areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| if we're going to keep low density in the outlying areas, we've got to have some places that we build condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:52| And I think that it's only logical that you build it in areas where there's already some condominiums built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| And when you drive up and down Gleason Road, there are numerous projects that are very similar to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| And this piece of property, the folks that are complaining about this don't even live on the same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:13| They're behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And they've already got another condominium complex that is behind it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| So we're going to find out if we're going to hear it today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| So we've got a motion to postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And we have properly seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| So all in favor of postponement for 30 days say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Okay. Do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| Who is the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| I was a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| He's got two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Okay. So it's been deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| Request of John Hancock for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential property located on the southeast side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| Lingate Boulevard, southeast of west of Beaver Creek Drive in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| Okay. Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4446)|

| 1:19:01| and we're working with the neighborhoods between this property and that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| to improve the entire length of the stream from Murphy Road all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4745)|

| 1:19:34| Is this a blue line stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| It is a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| It's a stream that's significantly impaired through most of several miles of transition, and we've got a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:49| That's true for almost every stream in Knox County, Mr. Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| But from where this property is, we're in the process of doing a plan with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| to do a stream improvement for the entire length of Murphy Creek from Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| all the property that we would either abut or be involved in all along the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| It'll be the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| It'll be the first stream credits issued by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| We're really proud of that fact, and we're working on a site plan all the way through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Is this part of that stream mitigation program that TDEC does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| That's millions of dollars for whenever they issue any credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| We're going to be the first ones, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4830)|

| 1:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Does improve the stream, which is a phrase you used twice, mean move the stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| We have no intention of moving the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| We're going to design all the stream mitigation criteria is all designed by TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| and we're in the process of fixing the places that TDEC is asking us to fix on the other property we've already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| testing on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4856)|

| 1:21:03| and the piece that we're going to be acquiring in March for this park that we're going to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| this 12-acre site, and we've already done the water sampling on that 12-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| We've already had TDEC out looking at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| We've already done soil testing on that site, and we've started on this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and we're hoping to reach an agreement with the property owner in between to create the length of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4885)|

| 1:21:28| Mr. Juergen, have you, with this thing that you're fixing to do, it's not the normal, what you're doing on the stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:36| is anybody going to sample the stream for species of fish that are in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| As a matter of fact, we have already sampled the stream all up and down its length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| from the property that we're acquiring all the way through to Beverly Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| SNME has already done samples, and we've already got a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| We're in the process of putting forward the study for the stream mitigation credit, so the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| That's what my degree is in from UT, and we used to, as students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| or we used to love to jump in the creek and say in the creeks and tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| UT will do that for you before and after, and it's a great resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| We're actually going to be in negotiations with East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4936)|

| 1:22:25| along the entire length of Murphy Creek, because there are no TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| TDEC does not have money for test sites anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| and so our project in South Knoxville-Wells Creek is going to be the first project that's going to be set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| for low-impact development monitoring of development sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| and this project will be the first one set up to monitor going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| But it's such a long stream, and we're asking if we can get some cooperation from East Tennessee State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| which has a permanent staff and a training of their students, their doctoral students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| and so we're trying to become a test site for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| In the same way with UT, UT's got a fine wildlife agency course over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| and the students just love to jump in the stream and sample them for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| so that might be a resource that you could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Richard, I appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Okay, Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=4991)|

| 1:32:41| This month's devotional will be by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:49| For this devotional, I've simply put together some pieces from Universalist tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| Let us devote ourselves today and every day to peace, justice, compassion, the beauty of the earth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| and the inherent dignity of every person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| And let us never be afraid to tap into our reason, creativity, and hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| imagining a God or a purpose larger and better than ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| If everyone will please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5596)|

| 1:33:24| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| We are on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| I have one I'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| It's from the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| If we have no objections to adding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| No objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Clerk will add that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| What did you add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Adding the resolution from the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Is that 918?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| It's always not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| The agenda is here, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| That would be 918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion that everything that needs to be added be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| And after that is approved, I'd like to pull 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| and ask that we be allowed to hear those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| We'll do them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| We'll do them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Pull that off without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5684)|

| 1:34:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| I didn't mean to have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Is there any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| I'm still looking for the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| I'd like to move the Zane Bruin 106 to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| I'll move them right after Commissioner Hammond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| If we have no objections, we'll take that one off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| My agenda has that being 105 along with another 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| I assume that should be 106, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Yeah, 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Without objections, we'll pull that off the consent and we'll hear it right after 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| Is there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| The dog ordinance, if we don't have objections to moving it right after 106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| I think we've got some people here to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| We'll put that one right after 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| I didn't turn it off while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Mr. Chairman, 908 has been withdrawn, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| There's a few items that we withdrew at committee and I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| All those that say withdraw, let's withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5781)|

| 1:36:23| I want to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| If there are no objections to everything that's to be withdrawn, be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Clerk, I guess if you want to start with 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:53| Resolution 101 is a consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| honoring Nicholas Nick Anthony Wirtosik for earning his Eagle Scout rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:11| If you would go ahead and read all of them, just their names would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| Honoring Andrew Addison Hamill for earning his Eagle Scout rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| Travis Edward Haston for earning his Eagle Scout rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| George Martin Stevens III for earning his Eagle Scout rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| And Ian Scott Turnbull for earning his Eagle Scout rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| We've got a motion to approve by Commissioner Hammonds, seconded by Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| I had a quick question for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| I wonder if there are any other commissioners that are Eagle Scouts themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| They're in a small group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| When you look at those who have achieved the Eagle Scout distinction, it includes Neil Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| It includes President Gerald Ford and a host of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| So this is a very distinguished group, and we hear a lot about young people who are doing the wrong things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| This is an opportunity to recognize some young men who are doing the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| All of these achieved their Eagle Scout distinction, and they had a ceremony for them just a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| And so there were five of them, and unfortunately some of them could not be here this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| But we do have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| And before I introduce him, Commissioner Luthold, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| It's a great honor to represent fine young folks that achieve beyond what the ordinary does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:43| And it's just a great honor to be here and really appreciate all that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| Because I know in order to achieve that, you have to do a lot of community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| And that's something that a lot of people, not just young people, a lot of people just aren't doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| And it is about giving back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| And I want to congratulate them for making this honor and all that they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| And I know they'll do great things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| We have with us today Travis Edward Haston, who has achieved this Eagle Scout rank, and Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:16| I've known Travis and his family for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| He's an outstanding young man, as are the rest of our recipients who he's receiving these awards for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| So, Travis, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I'm sure this is just the very first step in a lot of great things to happen over your career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| And we'd like for you to say a few words, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Well, first of all, I would like to thank all of you for the proclamations and Mayor Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| And, unfortunately, the other four couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| But I will be happy to take the rest of these to the troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| We have a troop meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| So I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| And, just again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Clerk, 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, memorializing Zane Bruin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| If you'll read that one into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| Whereas on January 11, 2008, marked the untimely death of Zane Bruin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| and whereas the 6'5", 315-pound football player from Powell was only 21 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| and whereas Zane was the son of former University of Tennessee football star John Bruin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| who went on to play for the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| and whereas Zane was an all-state lineman at Powell in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| and whereas Zane Bruin chose to play football for Marshall, ahead of Vanderbilt and South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| whereas Zane will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| Therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| The commission of Knox County hereby memorializes Zane Bruin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| and extends their deepest condolences to his family and friends in their time of mourning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Motion made by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Seconded by Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Commissioner Lambert, I just wanted to say, John, your loss is Knox County's loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I would like to thank you all for your compassion for my son, Zane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| You know, in the game of loft, he left in the first half early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| and we just got to buckle up our chin straps, as we do as a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| and just keep fighting harder to do good things for kids in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| John, me and Laurie have been praying for you and your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| and I know the rest of the commission have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| We know there's tough roads ahead, but we're going to continue to pray for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:21| Okay, we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Okay, we're on resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Article 2, Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| by modifying definitions in Section 6 through 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| and by repealing Division 2, Dangerous Dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| and adopting a new Dangerous Dog ordinance as Division 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| Ordinance number 0-96-5-101, Section 1, 2, and 1-8, 1-9, A through C, and 1-10, adopted 6-24-96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6167)|
| 1:43:00| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Intergovernmental voted 5-0 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| 5-0 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Motion made by Commissioner Pinkston, seconded by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Do you have some people here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Rob McConkie from my office has been working on this for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| If anyone has any questions, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| He is my office expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| If you want him to give you a brief overview of what work they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| let me turn it over to him for just a second, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| I don't know if you all have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| This is the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Essentially what this ordinance does is, first of all, amend the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| to define the term animal center in the animal control ordinance to mean the Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| or any other animal shelter under contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| The major thing that this ordinance does is to revise the dangerous dog ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| to make it consistent with the ordinance that is currently in place in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| so that the ordinances are defined in similar terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| and there's a similar procedure for dealing with dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| Are pit bulls specifically mentioned in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| or is there any type of breed that's mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| This is not a breed-specific ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| This ordinance deals solely with classification of dogs as either level one dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| or level two dangerous based on the behavior of the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| Certain characteristics of the dog or examples of behavior that would warrant a classification as a dangerous dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| would be any dog that has caused an injury to a person or animal when unprovoked, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:12| and then level two dangerous would be a serious injury or death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Do we have any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| In terms of a level one dangerous dog, would that be retroactive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| Say a dog had been identified to have either bitten someone or attacked another dog, another person's dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:43| Could someone who desired to, could they try to classify it as a level one dog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:56| I don't believe that this ordinance would have any retroactive application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| We do have a current ordinance in place that deals with dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| It just classifies them in different terms than what is in place in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:14| and puts in place, another major thing this ordinance does is put in place specific restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| that a judge may impose upon the owners with respect to the dogs if a dog is found to be level one or level two dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:29| But, no, I don't, it wouldn't be retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Does this strengthen the penalties or are we just going into classifications at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| And the ability for the officers to enforce current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| It strengthens the ability, what it does is clarify what can be done when a dog is classified as dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:57| Currently, under the current Knox County ordinance, all that can be done is an animal control officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| if they observe a dog not being kept in accordance with restrictions after it's been classified as dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| all they can do is cite the owner to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Under this ordinance, the first time it's classified as dangerous, there are specific restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| and those are spelled out in the ordinance, that the judge shall impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| And then if those restrictions are not followed, the animal control officers, upon observing a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| can then confiscate the animal pending a hearing with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| Well, let's just say it's first bite and the dog's not been classified level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| Can they not pick that dog up at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| They can pending a hearing, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Pending a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| If they go out to complain and a person's been bit, will they pick that dog up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Yes, it would be picked up and held in the animal center until a hearing and until restrictions are imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:14| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| I actually saw someone in the back that looked like they wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| but Commissioner Harmon has already talked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| No, I'm just three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| I noticed the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| We already have three people for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| So, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| Before we classify these dogs at, say, level two, say a dog bit me and if I don't report it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| and then it bit Commissioner Lambert here, all we have to go on is Commissioner Lambert's deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| And the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Well, we can move it up to the other level I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| So what I'm saying is every case really needs to be reported, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| Every case does need to be reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| But, again, if the attack or injury is what is classified in here as a serious injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:05| or causes death, then that would automatically be level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:13| We have three people for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Ann Robertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Lisa McMahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| That's a different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:36| State your name and address for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| Lisa McMahan, 11424 Allen Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| I was bitten in Knox County 6506.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| Knox County Sheriff's Department was called that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| They said I need to report it to Knox County Animal Control, which I did the very next morning at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| Knox County Animal Control did not investigate the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| Supposedly Officer Tina Lee went to the residence of 11325 Spring Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| The owner was allowed to keep the black lab from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| And a year and a half later, I want to know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| And I have the animal control report if anyone would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| The only information on there that's 100% is my information that I gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| And I had walked by this house at that time 19 and a half years exercising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:36| Lisa, I think what this ordinance does is give us more responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| and to answer calls like that and be able to do that in your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| I apologize that it didn't happen when they bit you, but I think in the future you'll see it happen differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| I certainly hope so because there's definitely some potential danger there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| We appreciate you coming down and telling us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| James Pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| James Pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| Would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| My name's Holly Hayward-Thomas, and I actually live at 1918 Rosemont Circle in Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| So I'm a Blount County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| But because of recent attacks due to Jennifer Love's demise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:35| it's drawn statewide attention to dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| And Senator Kilby is looking to introduce a law, which I know that has nothing to do with what we're here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| But as a responsible dog owner, I think it should be across the board rather than breed-specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| which I'm happy to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| So I just wanted to know, as far as mandatory spay-neutering, is that on the board for people that are licensing their animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| It would be a resolution to the overpopulation and also help animal control on calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:11| So I didn't know if that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| As far as mandatory spay-neutering, that is part of the restrictions that are imposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| when a dog is classified as dangerous under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| It is not, again, breed-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| But if a dog has engaged in behavior that will cause it to be found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| and there does have to be a hearing and evidence presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| but if a court finds the dog to be a dangerous dog under the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| then spaying and neutering becomes mandatory for that dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| And all animals that are picked up as strays before they can leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| regardless of owner claiming, are they mandated spayed and neutered as well or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| I think they are to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Sorry, I was leaning against the button again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Before the animal center, it's my understanding that the animal center's policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| before animals are adopted out to new owners, then, yes, they have to be spayed or neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| Currently, that is not a requirement for an owner to come in and redeem a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| But you may have heard there have been reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| and there are committees working right now to reform various parts of the animal control laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| That's not part of this ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| This ordinance deals specifically with dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| And just to clarify, if a person is, like, I have a totally fenced yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| but if one of my dogs was get out without my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| not that they're ever even in my fenced yard unattended, and I got a call placed on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| would my dog be seized immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| I'm not sure I understood your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Ma'am, if you'll pull the mic a little bit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| How is an owner classified, you know, that their dog is dangerous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| Just from not having the leash law and not, I guess I'm trying to figure out at what point it becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:12| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Let me find that section of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| It's really set out in great detail in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| But essentially, and commissioners, if you've got your ordinance in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| it would be the proposed section 672B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| A dog would be found to be level one dangerous if the court finds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| upon a preponderance of the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| that the dog has, when unprovoked while on the property of the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| has attacked a person on two or more occasions within the prior 24-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:55| or has, within the prior 24-month period while off the property of the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| engaged in any behavior when unprovoked that would reasonably require a person to take defensive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| or prevent bodily injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| So, yes, while a dog is off the owner's property without the owner's knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| if the dog does something that would cause a reasonable person to act to protect themselves from an attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:25| then, yes, the dog could be classified as dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=6929)|

| 2:01:47| We've asked for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| It helps us give a point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Okay. Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| Approval of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| Okay. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| Elections and appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Resolution 110 is approving the appointment of Thomas Deakins to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| Mr. Chairman, is anyone from the Ethics Committee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| I didn't see anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| And you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| The Ethics Committee voted against the appointment of Mr. Deakins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| and the reason was not against Mr. Deakins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| There is a concern among members of the Ethics Committee about elected officials being on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| Of course, Mr. Pinkston and I are elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| We are on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| And so that was their concern, and I believe they want to have a discussion with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| We were scheduled to have it the morning it snowed, and folks couldn't get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| So they would very much like to have that discussion with County Commission because we would have to change our policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| and so it's a procedure that would need to be gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| But they very much want to have that discussion as to whether or not elected officials should indeed be on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| So I just point that I don't have a problem with Mr. Deakins being appointed through July or, I guess, when the term is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| But as far as that discussion, that's what the Ethics Committee would like to discuss with the Commission is that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| That would give us a ten-board member there where we could possibly have tie votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| So I'll go ahead and make a motion that we approve Mr. Deakins for the remainder of this term, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Well, basically, what you're suggesting is then changing our policy to allow ten members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| If you're going to approve Mr. Deakins to sit on the ethics, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| So we would have to change the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| How about if we put it back on for next month and see if you can get someone from the ethics panel to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Discuss that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| Let me just point out that Mr. Deakins was unavailable on Monday because of the untimely death of his father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| and that he is an exceptionally ethical and dedicated individual who would be a good addition to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| and would raise issues that the school board and others probably need to raise on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Do we have a motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| I'd like a motion to defer to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| No, I was just in favor of Mr. Deakins because two-thirds of the body of Knox County is at the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| And if we're going to have any county commissioner, we should have someone from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| In my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| We've got a motion to put it on for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| I want to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| Okay, 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| Resolution 111 is appointing members to health insurance appeals boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Intergovernmental voted 4-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| I don't think we haven't received any names in the commission office, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| so I'll make a motion maybe that we substitute motion that we defer it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| Just a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Is there a process we go through to try to get people to these boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| Is there something that we do in the newspaper, for example, to post a notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Or how do we go about trying to get candidates for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| Well, I think there's some requirements they had to have, and it's in your book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| one dealing with the large insurance, being a benefit person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| and one having some financial experience in a large corporation or company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| So we really need to just look at the qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| and if we have any suggestions, send them to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| Yeah, I think if we have that by next month and talk about it at our agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Mr. Chairman, they have health insurance associations here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| Maybe they could submit some names, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| We haven't voted, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| All in favor, postpone it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7568)|

| 2:07:23| 4-0-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| This is a resolution requesting the Industrial Development Board of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| County of Knox to prepare an economic impact plan in connection with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7650)|

| 2:07:47| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Motion made by Commissioner Ballard, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| I believe this was the gentleman who, during committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| said two very interesting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| He's standing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| One is he said that he admitted readily that halls is not blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| one of the criteria for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| He also talked about this really moving a Walmart across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| And another standard for a TIF is that but for it, the project not go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| And he really admitted this project is going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| but he got himself in a bit of economic trouble and he wants us to help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| And it sort of goes to the old maxim that I don't think we want to get involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| which is maximize profits and socialize losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| I think this is a bad use of a TIF, and I would recommend we vote against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| Bruce Weicher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:58| You don't have to look so glum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| When we discussed this at committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| we talked about the road improvements that need to be done at this area on these roads out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:21| And some of them would require, I mean, he's already doing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| and some of them that you've said that you've identified that we need to do regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:32| Do you have a cost analysis of what, if this project were not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| what would the county need to do and how much that was going to cost Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| Roughly $10 to $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| $10 to $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| With this going in, how much of that, $10 to $12 million, is this project doing within the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:58| You probably need to talk to the petitioner on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Mr. Cullum, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| My name is Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| As I said to the finance committee last week, Mr. Weitrich and I are still working on some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:23| that's the first time I'd heard that it was a $10 to $12 million estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| We have some more work to do based on whether this body decides to have a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:33| for the Industrial Development Board to study this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| Right now, our TIF application that we have filed asks for $4.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| and our TIF district that we have drawn, it only encompasses our development, our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:52| One of the, there were four components listed in that TIF application that added up to the $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7852)|
| 2:11:00| Those components were a complete redo of the intersection at Emory Road and Andersonville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| a continuation of a widening with turn lanes and a construction of a median in Norris Freeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:15| that picks up from where the state is widening part of that already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| where they're redoing Emory Road from Norris Freeway all the way back to ultimately to Interstate 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| Another component was a 84-inch concrete storm pipe that we put in that is handling drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| for 350 to 400 acres of upstream drainage that was not prior or previously being handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| And the last component of that was a road that we plan on dedicating to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| that would be bisecting our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| Mr. Weitrick and I have had discussions, and he has hired an engineer to begin designing improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7911)|
| 2:12:01| over and above the improvements that I have just outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| And those go, and if he wants to detail these more, I'll let him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| but I think those go on Norris Freeway to where it connects to Maynardville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:15| and completely redoing the intersection of Norris Freeway and Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| Mr. Weitrick has expressed to me that there have been improvements needed in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| probably dating back 10 years, irrespective of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| As I mentioned, and I respect Mr. Harmon's comments earlier, but as I mentioned last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:39| our situation, a lot of the people are aware that we have been wrestling with doing a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| on this property since approximately the middle of the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| Various things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| Long story short, we were finally able to get commitments from our two anchor tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| and that's Walmart and Home Depot, in the middle of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:07| At that point, we had waited so long, we thought we had our numbers that we had estimated previously in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:15| We made commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| We got bids in over the course of probably the three years prior to 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| Those bids came in on the order of $3 million to $4 million higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| At about that same time, we realized that we were not going to be able to get any other help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| from our anchor tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| Just previous to that, we had seen that a TIF had been approved in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| for a very similar development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| We thought, well, maybe we can manage to get some help on the infrastructure that we're putting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:50| that is going to help the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| We started discussions with Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| We planned on filing a TIF application, and right at that time is when the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| decided to change their policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| They also decided to not accept or to effectively have a moratorium on TIF applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| for a period to hire an outside consultant, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, from St. Louis to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| and to spend, I think, two to three months reviewing policies and procedures, coming up with a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| Two or three more months goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| Effectively, we have sat on our hands after having committed to these tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| and sat on our hands and waited until the IDB had everything in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I think they now have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| I'm simply tonight asking this board to make a resolution asking the IDB to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| The IDB, I know, will be drilling me on every aspect I know that they will be getting with Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8088)|
| 2:14:56| What we have done with Mr. Weitrick is we have come in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| look, we would like to work with you to expand our TIF or maybe use some of the money we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| If you can't support some of the components of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| use some of that money to go toward making a down payment, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| on this $10 million to $12 million worth of improvements that he wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| that is totally irrespective of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| Sorry, I rambled, but I tried to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| I guess I'm still looking for the short answer, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| how much of what the county needs to do regardless of you being there or doing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:40| versus how much that you're doing of the work that we would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| In other words, how much is there an overlap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Because if you're paying for what we're going to be paying for anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| then I don't have a problem with helping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| And I guess that's, you know, and it may be you're asking for $4.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| but is it $1 million, $2 million, or whatever is, you know, where is that overlap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| And I think that's where I think we should be at because we were going to have that expenditure anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:14| And I think Mr. Weitrick may be able to answer that a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| In my mind, it was Mr. Weitrick in conjunction with the IDB that was ultimately going to tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8178)|
| 2:16:30| There's a little bit of a timing problem here in the sense that the $10 to $12 million project I'm referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| we literally received conceptual plans on that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| So when we first discussed this with the developer, those plans had not been completely generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| and we haven't even shared those plans with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Literally, it was a meeting with the engineering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| There's no question that that project, what we're referring to as the halls connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| is clearly a project that needs to be done irrespective of whether they build a Walmart out there or any other construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| That's clearly a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| The other project that was identified in part of this process is the four-way stop at Maryville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:13| excuse me, at Emory Road and Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| That intersection needs to be repaired here again irrespective of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Is that something that he is preparing to do if we don't do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| Essentially, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| Just to be candid with you, we bargained a pretty good deal with him as part of the approval of his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| He agreed to go ahead and do the upgrade at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| all the while realizing that that upgrade at that intersection was essentially already needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| Now, the turn lanes that he was referring to out on Norris Freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| that's clearly something that needs to be done in regards to that's his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| That's something that needs to be done just for the Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| The 84-inch concrete pipe that runs through the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Here again, I mean, I've already told them this in our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| that clearly that's part of his project and should not, in my opinion, be included in the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| However, the Halls Connector and certainly Andersonville four-way stop is legitimate in being inclusive in the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8284)|
| 2:18:14| Any idea of what price tag would be on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| I do know that the total price tag is, like I said, hovering around $10 to $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| But you've not separated out how much is the overlap that he's doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| And one of the reasons that has not transpired is that, first off, the Halls Connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| we have not had an opportunity to get back with the community to show them what we've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| We've not had a follow-up public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| So that plan has not been finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| We do have a conceptual plan that I can work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| But in fairness, we have not met with the community and gone back over that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| and got additional input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| So it's far from set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| I guess what I'm looking at, I'm trying to figure out, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| and he's doing some work for us, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| And I don't mind helping out with that part because, I mean, I think that should be our obligation anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:10| But if there are things that he's doing simply because it's for his project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| then that may be something that I guess we could debate whether or not we should help him out with a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| But I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to get, you know, $4.5 million is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:28| If half of that is money that we would have spent on it anyway, then I can accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| So I guess if you don't have a hard number, I guess you don't have a hard number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| But I can't agree with your statement in regards to half of that would be spent by the county anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| Whatever that number is, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I mean, if it's half, is it a third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Maybe what we're doing tonight and to the people at home and in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| we're just basically pushing it to the IDB, giving him permission basically to go to the IDB board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| where this project is going to be closely scrutinized, and that's where the hard numbers will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| And then it will come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| And if you recall last month, Mr. Chairman, Mike Edwards, when he was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| if he was here tonight, I'd ask him the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| He's looking for guidance from this body so that when he goes before the IDB board as to what are we looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:30| as far as should be approved and should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| And so I guess I'm trying to at least clarify what I'm interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| You know, other commissioners may have different opinions of what we should offer as a TIF and what we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| Because I think we, you know, you start taking a look at $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| Sir, do you know how long this TIF, is it a 15-year TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| Yes, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Which is the absolute max that they're allowed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| And quite frankly, I'm not in favor of 15-year TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| If we're talking a one or two million dollar TIF, which we would have spent money on anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:11| and you're talking maybe a seven or eight year TIF, then that's something I could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| So I'm just trying to get my arms around what I can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| and tell the IBD board, the industrial board, what I would be in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| Then that's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| So, I mean, that's just my line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| I think Commissioner Moore made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| Mr. Weitrich is going to be getting some other figures in and we're going to be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| And I know Mr. Weitrich well enough to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| and I know most of the members of the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| are not going to, I'm not going to be able to sway them by any kind of rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| They're going to dive into the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| They're going to listen to Mr. Weitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| If Mr. Weitrich says that a $4.5 million, only $2 million is actually supported for your development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| and I want to use the other $2.5 million to go toward these other improvements that he's designing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:05| I'm going to live with that result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| What we're also saying is that if we potentially can draw the district larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| to encompass more of the area, as he calls it, the halls connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| it may be that the TIF will support not $4.5 million, but $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| So by way of example, if $4.5 million ultimately is what the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| and the financial analyst determine can be supported on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| and we draw the TIF district larger and say $6.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| and he only determines that $2 million of what I'm asking for ultimately should go to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| then that's a $4.5 million down payment potentially could go toward work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| that he otherwise is going to have to wait and draw from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| That's what we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| I will take credit or the blame, as such should be, for having this on the agenda now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:59| I potentially was mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| but I felt that this board or this commission had to issue a resolution to go to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| After listening to Mr. Edwards talk some more, I'm still somewhat confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| Maybe that wasn't required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| but I'm asking this commission to simply pass a resolution requesting the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:23| to prepare an economic impact analysis and also work with Mr. Weitrich on possibly expanding it to help him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:30| with something that otherwise would have no impact on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| but ultimately it will be good for the area so it will be positive for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| Let me just add something right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| You know, as I think we probably give a lot of TIFs in a lot of districts, probably everyone's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| We've not had something like this in the Hollis community to upgrade the road system, the Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| the North Freeway in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| And either we're going to have to pay for it ourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| or we can let the private development people do it and probably saves us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| by them doing it instead of us trying to do it in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| because usually it costs us a lot more to do something than it would somebody in the private sector to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| And for the people at home, we're not giving these individuals $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| You know, they're going to do some work and over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| whatever the property brings into all of Knox County will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| And whatever the increase is after the building is built will go to pay the TIF off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| And this is for the people at home and in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| And, you know, I just think it's a good way to help the 7th District be able to get the road improvements that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| while having new development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| So, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| I'm, you know, but I'm for the project for you doing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| However, I'm selecting Mr. Commissioner Hammond with the comments that he made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| It's going to be a hard sell for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| You know, I feel your pain with the numbers and stuff that you're coming up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| But I do like the fact that we're going to pass it to the board, let the board take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| and get the hard crunch numbers and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| But here's my real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| You know, I'm like John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| John, you know, this is, we're looking at these, and I mentioned this in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| We've had so many of these TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| There's a lot more out there on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| And here again, I'm going to state one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| I'm relying on you for the administration or whoever to tell us, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| here's sort of what you can do in a year TIF-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| TIFs are unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| You know, you can do 20 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| So I'm leaning on you guys to tell us this is what keeps our bond rating where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| Or, guys, you're sort of at your max here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| So I need a little guidance, you know, in the future as to what we can do and what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| One of the things that I think needs to be considered is how much would be in our capital plan anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| And I think if we all looked at our capital plan in the future, it's not anywhere near what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| And I don't anticipate a big change soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| You know, if this isn't going to affect us, you know, Bud, anyway, and it's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| then, you know, I'm a lot with Mr. Lutho, what he said, I agree with a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| But, you know, I'm for going ahead and then passing it on to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| let them come back and tell us, guys, here's what we think, and then we'll look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| And I wish you well in the project with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| If I could, I'd like to ask Mr. Troyer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| And this answer may hurt me or help me or it may not affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| But from the standpoint, I guess where I'm headed is if we can put in place something to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8792)|
| 2:26:42| whether it's $2 million, $4 million, whatever help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| to go toward a project that otherwise would have to, for certain, come out of the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| is that not a situation that ultimately tremendously helps the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| I understand where TIFs get problematic when a developer wants a TIF and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| this is public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Well, yeah, on one hand, you can say it is public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| But on another hand, as Mr. Weitrick has told me and has told you and will tell us all again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| it may be public improvement, but if you're solely doing it for your development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| I'm going to have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| You're going to have to really prove to me why I need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| If you're doing something that I know as a county engineer was going to be needed anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| and you're also offering to chip in and help me ride your shoulders to get money that otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:33| would have to come out of the general fund and ride on the balance sheet of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| I guess is it possible that if my TIF takes and does something that he would have to pull millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:45| from the general budget, does that not help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| And I want to say that that's part of what I think is the discussion that needs to happen is how much would we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| and how much would he do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| And that's part of the details that we need to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| And I think that's what I'm asking is for a resolution for us and Mr. Weitrick and the IDB to start negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:05| and studying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| You know, if they come back and say there's no problem, you know, I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| But if they say, you know, then I'll take a second look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Let me say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| Mr. Cullum, you may be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| At the end of the 15 years, if you get a four and a half million or two million, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| and at the end of that 15, it's not all paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| As I understand it, you are on the hook for whatever the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| And another one of my partners is sitting here and one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| But, yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| We would have to personally sign on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:39| And so ultimately, you know, if there was $500,000 that was not paid off at the end of that 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:47| it's my understanding that we would have to pay that off either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| And, Mr. Chairman, you made a good point, which you're talking about the people at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| I don't think people understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| What is the overall cost of your overall project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| You're asking for four, but, I mean, how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| My overall project, and keep in mind, I can't be exact because there's some development that, say, out parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| we may have a bank that builds their own building, but we've had a lot of experience at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| and we're projecting an overall cost, I believe, around $45 million, Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| Around $45 million when fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| I'm really torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| And I'm a big fan of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| And I believe that TIFs are very useful in all areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| You know, I don't think we necessarily have to, it has to be a blighted area to use a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| The three questions I ask myself is, is it a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| And I think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| The second question I ask myself is, is there a public component to this that justifies the use of public funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:58| And I believe that there is, because there is some infrastructure that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| The next question I ask myself is, is this project going to happen without the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| And this is where I'm torn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| If this had come to me before you broke ground, I would have probably supported a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:23| Now I'm stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| And honestly, I don't know how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| But that's the dilemma I'm in, is that since the project is already underway, the project is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| And I'm just stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| Because if this had come to us sooner, before you broke ground, I would have probably supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| And I may still support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| But I'm just stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| And I certainly have not tried to, in any way, shape, or form, try to say, give me the TIF or we're not going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9054)|
| 2:31:04| Anybody who's been out there can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| Let me stop you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| There are going to be some things, if you get the TIF, that you're going to do some road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| If you don't get it, you're going to do your project, but you're not going to do all the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| You're not going to be in a position to help Mr. Weitreich with some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| Without sounding flippant, Commissioner Lambert, as I mentioned earlier, I told someone, it may have been you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9084)|
| 2:31:30| the question was posed to me, will the deal die without the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| And I said, the deal may not, but the developer might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:41| We had a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| Our timing was horrible because we were planning before we started to come to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:49| and that's when the IDB said we're pulling all applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| And we thought, well, it may be for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Well, it turned out two months, then three months, then four months, then five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| And we had commitments we had to make, and we basically were between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:07| And I know that this project is going to generate a lot of sales tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| and it's going to pull in sales tax dollars from the other side of the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| And like I said, I'm going to listen to what everybody else has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| I'm not sure how I'm going to vote on this yet, but if you hadn't broke ground, I'd probably be all for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9141)|
| 2:32:31| I would be preaching a sermon on TIFs because I am definitely sold on using a TIF as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:39| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Well, we're, again, we're, as Commissioner Moore said, this is a way for us to possibly help the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:49| make a very large down payment and speed up the timing on something that otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| would definitely be coming out of the general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Have you run any figures as to how much revenue you think would come outside Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| I think Commissioner Lambert has a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| I mean, do you have that or any estimates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| Because I know you gave us the sales tax revenue as to what you would anticipate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| Commissioner Hammond, I have not ordered a scientific study on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:24| I mean, I could take some guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| But, again, it would not be a scientific study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| If that's something that the IDB would like for us to do as we get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| I know that there are firms who will do a study like that, but I have not gone to that extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| The reason I ask that is we know that in Turkey Creek they've done analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| and found that people are coming from Roan County as far as where is Roan County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| and Anderson County and Blount County and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| And a lot of people are getting paychecks who live outside of Knox County because of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| So I think you've got a quality development going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| I'm going to vote in favor of sending it on to IDB because it's an impact plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:05| not actually voting on a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| But I think the bigger question that bodes here is, Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| would you mind telling me what type of guidelines do we look at in terms of awarding a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| or as you're looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| I know Mr. Edwards was here and Commissioner Leuthold alluded to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| that he's looking for guidance from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| I'm wondering what type of guidance we could provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| Do we need to maybe get together and work on guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| These are just questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| I think a basic rule of thumb, Commissioner, may be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| If it's something that Knox County needs to do anyway, as Mr. Weitrick alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| and we do have some road issues in that area that are very prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| that we've been trying to resolve for years, this will help move us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| So if we can do that, I think it makes great sense to do a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| South Knox was an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| It helped in development, but it also improved traffic efficiency and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| We need to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:57| If we can't move in that direction, then I don't think it makes any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| just to be 100% helpful for a business to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| That should be their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| Okay, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| I think I could support this if I knew a better number of what the county's cost would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9312)|
| 2:35:18| regardless if you were there or not and you were helping out like the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9318)|
| 2:35:25| I don't know that I can just go ahead and sort of open up the blank check for the entire four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| If I knew it was going to be one or two or if the whole four and a half was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| going to be a county expense regardless, then I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| But right now, since I don't have any hard numbers in front of me, I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| I do wish you well, but I do need to know that number, and I did ask that last week at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9345)|
| 2:35:58| So it's not that I wouldn't want to try to help out where you're helping us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| but without that number, I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| If I could ask you a question, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| Is that not the number that we're seeking to find out through our analysis with the IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9368)|
| 2:36:16| Well, I don't know what the IDB is going to necessarily look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| That may be one component and it may be some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| So I guess my-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| And, you know, here again, I still don't like going 15 years out into the future on these TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9385)|
| 2:36:36| I would prefer they be more, you know, no more than ten and hopefully seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| So, you know, because, you know, 15 years from now, I mean, no one on this body is going to be still sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:53| And, you know, we're handicapping what future bodies in the government may possibly need that additional taxes as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9413)|
| 2:37:08| You know, we've talked about sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Well, the Walmart's already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| So to say the Walmart out there is going to generate so much in sales tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:20| well, I guess my question is, what's the net increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| I mean, because obviously people are shopping at Walmart now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| So if they shop at the new one, do they sell more or are they selling about the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| And if it's about the same, then there's really no net sales tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| So I guess if you had a good way to figure out what would be the net increase in sales tax, I think that could help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:43| But I don't think you're going to be able to get that number tonight either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I'm not going to be able to get that specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| Well, I can say that the relocation is from a general merchandise store to what they consider their super center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| which is a full-line grocery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| Typically, sales will go up anywhere from 50 percent to 100 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| depending on the location and the size of the previous store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| But I understand it's certainly the total sales tax number, there's an increment that would be a net gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9486)|
