| 0:00:00| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| That's not what I'm implying with my positive statements toward them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=2)|
| 0:00:07| But, you know, I think they're involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=7)|
| 0:00:10| They're engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=10)|
| 0:00:11| I'm sure the Board of Professional Responsibility, which is their, you know, that's their police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=11)|
| 0:00:19| They're the ones that police lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=19)|
| 0:00:24| They're handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| And, again, I'll say I think we just need to let that system work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=25)|
| 0:00:31| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| I have to agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| We're all getting phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| We're all getting emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| We're being stopped everywhere we go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| And I do feel like that we as a body, as commissioners, have done everything that we can possibly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| And, most importantly, I mean, I don't see how any of the Knox County people could not realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| especially from today's meeting, that we're all on the same page except one right here that voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=56)|
| 0:01:06| I'm not getting stopped either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| You know, we take this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| But I believe if Kimberly, Montgomery, and Finley, they are a very high-ranking law firm here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| have been for years, if they could speak on this and let us know who, they would have already done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| So I believe that the reason why they're not doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| it's got to be legal reasons as to why they've not come forward and let anybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| Because, obviously, as not team, we want to know just as much as anybody else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| So I'm going to make a motion to deny this because I feel like Kimberly, Montgomery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| and Finley would have already let us know if their responsibility was to let us know on the legal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=105)|
| 0:01:55| I'll make a motion to deny because then we run into the same problem we ran into before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| A motion to approve, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| Did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| If we don't even have the first motion, we don't even have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| But then it can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| But then it can come back, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| This keeps everybody from talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Do we have a second to your motion to which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| The denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| I second it, and I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| I don't see any more lights, so we can just go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Two of the ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=159)|

| 0:02:45| You voted aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Motion fails 17-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| You had four abstained there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Four abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| You abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| That'd be Pinkston, Winant, Dunclan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| We got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| How many abstentions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=184)|

| 0:04:15| We have three discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| No, we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| I can move through these really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Well, we have public forum before the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Is there anybody here for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| I bet she left about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Arlo, you got anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=268)|

| 0:04:31| I saw Brad out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I guess...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Where's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Now, folks, just so we don't miss out, I've got Brad Mays's memorized, if you want me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| to recite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| We have three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| One is that I asked the law director...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Discussion regarding request for report from the law director's office on all pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| I just wanted an update from the law director's office during this time of upheaval, or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| you want to call it, that we have a report on where we stand on all pending cases before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Would you settle for a statement from Mr. Jarrett that everything's kosher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| That's exactly what I was asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Mr. Jarrett, can you give us that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| And that it can be transmitted electronically so we don't have stacks of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| So, just to throw them clear, the request is you want those cases, all pending litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| or those matters in which Mr. Lockett is assigned counsel to those cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Those matters in which he is assigned counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Discussion regarding a request for the rules committee to evaluate the commission rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| for possible updates and or changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| I'd just like for the rules committee to meet and go over the commission rules and update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| and revise them as is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| I know at least one instance where they need to be revised, and I imagine that holds true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| for the entire rulebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| Do you have anything specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| As a matter of fact, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| And you all can have a really good laugh at this, but when we were researching about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| NACO conference, it said that the commission chair or his designee, and so I want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| through and correct for the sexist language to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Who's the chairman of the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| He abstained about a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I said I was well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| We will have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| I'll get everything lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Thank you, Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| That was my request to have a meeting with the chairman of the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| That would have solved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| And then the Epilepsy Foundation's volleyball fundraiser is happening July 11th, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part3?start=425)|
