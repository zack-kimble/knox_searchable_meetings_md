| 0:04:47| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Mayor Haslam, I wouldn't be following my usual practice if I didn't say that we need to be very supportive right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| in about, what, 50 minutes of some lady vols that are going for a national championship in the softball, NCAA softball tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| And I think it's another good time to just remind ourselves these lady vols are doing us all really proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| And you notice I emphasize the word lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| But we would be glad to cheer them on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| But I have been really fascinated to hear how many times Knoxville has been mentioned on the ESPN broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| That's good news for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| I also want to let council know we have reached agreement with the property owner where we proposed putting the transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| We'll have more details of that to you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| There is a part of the, it's contingent upon a couple of things, one of which is approval and closing within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| so that will be coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Obviously, we don't have the details to give to you, but just a little heads up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| we'll be coming to you with that at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Mayor Haslam, can I just comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| When it was initially an opportunity to meet with Mr. Zinner and discuss the proposal before us all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| I was unable to go because I had been ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| And I just want, I really think it's wonderful that he has given so much time to council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and so much opportunity for us to sit down and talk with him and understand his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| which is a wonderful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| It's a wonderful business that has its birth here in Knoxville and reaches out all over the world, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| And I just want, I personally appreciate the amount of time he gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| and I know he has given all of the council members to assist the city in working through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| He's a remarkable man, and I think it's been wonderful working with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Nine A's in ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| agencies and funds of the city of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| and ending June 30, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| We do have four people sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| I was going to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| We've been provided in our additional packet what is nine A amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| so I'm assuming that's amended adding in the changes that the administrator is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| so we don't need to actually amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| We move to approve this amended one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| I would really think you would want to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| I think we need to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| It's my understanding we need to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| so we probably do need a motion to amend and then we can have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| if there's somebody who would like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Now we'll have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| What I was going to say is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| based on discussions with council members individually with the administration and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| I'd like to have Mr. Martin please explain to us the amendments to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| so that we're clear on what we are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Vice Mayor Brown and council members, the total budget, as you know, does not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| This is some movement within the total of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| Briefly, the first change is to increase the minimum amount paid for callback or court time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| It had previously, it has been, two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| and we're proposing to move that to a minimum of three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| The estimated cost for that is $81,230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| The second change that we're proposing is to increase the amounts paid for first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| EMT, and paramedic certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| For first responders, the change would be $100 from $500, which it is currently, to $600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| For EMT, it would be a $200 increase from $750 to $950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| And then for paramedic, it would be a $500 increase to $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| We estimate the cost of these changes to be $83,460.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| The third proposed change is to increase the amount provided for health care incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| As you know, we provide several different types of incentives for health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| This particular change is to incentives that are given to certain segments of employees based on their annual compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=557)|
| 0:09:29| Currently, individuals earning less than $27,000 are eligible for a $100 contribution to an FSA account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=569)|
| 0:09:40| and individuals earning between $27,001 to $37,000 may receive a $50 contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| We're requesting to change both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Upping the category for individuals earning up to $27,900 would receive a $150 incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=592)|
| 0:10:03| Those earning between $27,901 and $38,200 would receive $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| The reason for the changes in the earnings numbers is due to applying the assumed increase of the 3.25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=611)|
| 0:10:22| So that's how we arrive at those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| This, of course, is tied to their doing a health assessment, which is beneficial to them and to the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=626)|
| 0:10:35| We estimate the cost of this change to be $38,410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| This amounts to the total of these is just slightly over a couple of hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| The bulk of that to be covered with the proposal that we lower the amount of our street paving from $4.6 million to $4.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=650)|
| 0:11:02| So a $200,000 reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| That's still $200,000 more than what was included in the 0607 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| So those are the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| And then the only other change is Council Member Roddy asking that her portion of the 202 fund be removed from the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| and that $10,000 has been moved to the reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Those are the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| There are some people signed to speak, so I think we'll go ahead and go to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| If that's okay with council, I'm going to take those in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Stan McCroskey, then Anita Cash, then Lloyd Strong, and Scott Coffey signed up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| And if with council's permission, we'll let him speak as well to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Go ahead, Stan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| I'm Stan McCroskey, president of Dornover Police, Volunteer Lodge 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| at A213 Weeble Oak Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Mr. Mayor, members of council, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| Of course, you know we're human and we still want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| We appreciate the time you all have put in and the effort that you've put in to look for the extra dollars to provide benefits for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=722)|
| 0:12:14| We have, and I've discussed this with the mayor and Mr. Martin and council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| we think our relationship with administration and council has improved tremendously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| and we hope to keep an open dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| And hopefully we can work out something where council won't have to meet for six hours at workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| and won't have to find this extra funding because, honestly, I'm sure you all, like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| would rather be home doing something else than sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| But, again, we want to thank you and hope we continue to work on the needs of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| and provide what we can and do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| Anita Cash, president of City Employees Association, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| I'd like to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| I want to thank each of you for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| I want to say that with the exception of the fire department pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| every employee in general government would be eligible for the callback pay, not just the police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| which we do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| And the biggest majority of people that will benefit from the health incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| also comes from the general government population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| While it's not what we asked for, I do encourage you to let's get started on this salary survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| so we're not this stage of the game next year and let's get that rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| and answer council member Woodhull's question, are we really underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Thanks, Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Lloyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Lloyd Strong, 614 North Central, president of Knoxville Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| When we first came before you about a couple of months ago, we requested a 10% across the board pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=844)|
| 0:14:14| We requested our longevity pay to be increased from $10 to $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| We also requested that our EMS pay be doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| We didn't sit around and pull these numbers out of a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| We had some resources that we looked at and we felt like that we were underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| One of the resources came from the city civil service survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| During the first two meetings, we heard from the mayor that he felt like the survey was flawed in some respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=885)|
| 0:14:56| He might be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| We heard a lot about a reoccurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| What I'm asking the mayor tonight would be we have the resources to do a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=901)|
| 0:15:11| but before we would take on that task, we would like to ask you to tell us in writing exactly what you want out of that survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=911)|
| 0:15:22| so there will not be any misunderstanding at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| We would even go to the extent of asking you the geographical areas that you want, factor in the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=928)|
| 0:15:39| And if these surveys come back as bad as we think they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| we would like publicly for you to commit that you will try to make some progress in correcting the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=945)|
| 0:15:57| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| I don't know that it's appropriate to have one of our associations do the survey on behalf of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| I think what we will commit to you, and I think it's what you and I have talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| is before we decide how we're going to do that survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| we'll sit down with each one of the employee groups as part of the discussion group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| and determine who and how we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| But I appreciate your offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| I just personally don't think that's appropriate for one association to pay for the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| But I appreciate the generosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| and you all will be part of the decision about how we go about doing a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| I would like to probably have a meeting with you in the very near future because I have some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| and I don't want to try to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Thanks, Lloyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Bob, do you want to go now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Well, yeah, this is just, I mean, I think it's a wonderful offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| And I'm wondering, we've had discussions about sort of this big question of how we pay for the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| and it might be interesting to open up the discussions to see if there's a possible source to help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| to jointly fund something, to do a public-private partnership to get this paid for like we've done on other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| that would save the taxpayer money and give us a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Daniel, you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, I'd like to add to what Lloyd said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Our National Paternal Order of Police office in Nashville has a section now that does nothing but that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:24| salary and compensation surveys and comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| So we can get with you and see what we can do on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Scott Coffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Scott Coffey, 7212 Wild Bend Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| I'm, as you know, Vice President of the FOP and also Chairman of our Pay and Benefits Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| I basically echo mostly everything that everybody here said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| What I would like to commend this council, the mayor, and particularly the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| is the effort that I know the mayor and the finance director really put in to addressing one of our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| that was the court pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| And, of course, the mayor and I have already had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Next year we'll be asking for four hours, but we're going to get three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| And, ladies and gentlemen, that's at least a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Like I said, that is a big step in the right direction for people that are stuck working a night shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| and coming off of a day shift or something to that effect or coming in on your days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| So I know that that is appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| And the other thing I would like to mention is I appreciate the mayor committing to review the pay ban situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| and rectify the problem by making some type of another pay scale that can be raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:53| can be addressed a little more appropriately than what they are under the pay bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Because I know all of you, including civil service, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| have gone to great lengths to try to find a legal way to raise people within pay bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| And, unfortunately, there's not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| And so we appreciate the efforts you're going to put into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| and we appreciate the fact that we're going to be involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Thanks, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Mr. Martin, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| The reallocation of the funds to pay for these changes comes from the capital account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| And I know we've been down this road many times before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| and although this is a recurring capital item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| it's still a capital item that I think the road paving that I think needs to be addressed in a responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| If at the mid-year report in January, if we find that revenues are ahead of expenses at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| would this be the first item to be added back to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Well, it certainly would be on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And I would think toward the top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| certainly was the case when we had that situation earlier this year with the 06-07 budget to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| I think it's going to warrant our need because it's going to be difficult to stay to our plan relative to paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| when you take into consideration cost increases and those sort of things that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| But not knowing what else might be looming out there, it's hard to answer that question categorically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| but I think it would be close to the top of our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I mean, I understand that there are certainly unknown priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| or needs that may come up in the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| but with the cost of asphalt going up all the time with the cost of petroleum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| this council came into a situation where road paving was behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| and we've made a real effort to get caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| And I hate to see us underfunding that year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| and getting back into that behind kind of position again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| We agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Other comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| We actually need to vote on the amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1267)|

| 0:23:01| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I have a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I thought that Councilman Hultquist's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| and I thought we approved it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| He was going to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| He was going to check on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| and he wasn't sure about second reading until he did some checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So without that report back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| I'm a little uncomfortable approving it on final reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| From what I understand, I'm not certain this plan is even going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Remember, this is the one where we postponed for 180 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| just because he was uncertain of some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| So it came back up last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Councilman Hultquist said, let me check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| We passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I would recommend at least postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| It's Council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| But I don't think this is, from what I understand, ready to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| I, for one, am uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| So I'll move to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1427)|

| 0:24:12| We have several folks lined up to speak in favor and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Those speaking in favor will go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I'll just call them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| First will be Ed Cox, then Jim Parris, then Bill Regus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| If you'd come to the microphone and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:36| Bill Regus, 6711 Baum Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| That's my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| And I hang out at Regus' restaurant some, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Briefly, I want to give you a little history of the Riverside Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| It was under the other administration that they came to us with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| saying we want you to put a tavern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| And we would have not gone and proceeded with the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| had we not had 300 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Now, we bought a two-acre leasehold from the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| that the city appointed to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| We bought two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| We paid $875,000 for two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| We had 150 exclusive parking spaces in our two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Then we were promised in the legal document another 150 non-exclusive parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| and we just ended up with 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| We were 78 short on the reciprocal parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| And the developer said, well, we'll lease 42 spaces from James White and you'd have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| And then the developer went bankrupt and we lost those 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| So we're 78 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And in the agreement, we were to pay after the fifth year 1% rent after the fifth year of our sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:23| But the developer went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| The commitment for the 150 parking spaces were 78 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| We didn't feel it was appropriate to pay when the legal documents weren't honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| And I commend the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| We've been working for three years trying to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| And the law department represented the city very well because we've gone back and forth and back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| And this is a reasonable solution where Riverside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| and the other tenants that volunteer landing would release any claim against the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| for not providing the parking that was legally documented in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And it's cost us a lot of business and a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| And I was fortunate enough to get Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I know the CEO of Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And he came to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| We ate at Regus and then went to Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| And he liked the Riverside location and he made us a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| And I think it's a win-win for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| I'm reluctant to be on the opposite side of my friend, Mike Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| I didn't know he would be offended by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| But it was a legal agreement and the city is trying to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| And we're trying to work a lease with Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| We've got June the 15th to work a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| We have to have the city approval and we have to have TVA approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Normally when you have a leasehold on a piece of land or you own the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| you don't have to have anybody's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| But this was a government property that they turned over to the TVA and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| And we've got to have a lot of various approvals on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| But I commend the city for trying to work a fair resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| And I appreciate very much your approval so we can move ahead with the Ruth Chris lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| I think they would add a great deal to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| There will be a little bit of competition for Regus Restaurant, but we'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| We think it's good for the city and I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you, Mr. Regus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Cox or Mr. Parris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Mr. Cox, one, two, three, three, five, butternut circle here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| There's been some confusion I think that we want to address about that somehow the proposed amendment to the sub-lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| was going to somehow result in a windfall to the partners of Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| As Mr. Regus began saying, the partners in Riverside have invested initially about $2.6 million in the tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1760)|
| 0:29:30| Since that time, they've borrowed over $3.5 million to construct the facility, the building that's located there now and operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:40| Even though the proposed sub-lease will involve leasing to Ruth Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| and will involve Ruth Chris paying rent to Riverside, this money is not going in their pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| Even if Riverside goes away, the debt does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| And what that money will simply do will go to pay the debt that the partners have already incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| If you looked at what was ultimately going to be going into the pockets of the partners of Riverside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| if you gave them or invested a dollar in this nine years ago, you will approximately receive back about $0.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:15| And if you take the time value of money, you're talking about approximately a $0.28 on the dollar return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| What the partners at Riverside have been working with the city about is to come to a resolution where the tavern would not go dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| which would not be beneficial to either the partners of Riverside or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| The tavern was one of the first developments along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and the attraction of a first-class tenant would be not only a win for the partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| but certainly also a win for the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| There is some issue, obviously, that comes up on the percentage rent, and certainly a deal is a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| The deal was initially made that one percent after the first five years would be paid in percentage rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| There is certainly, as Mr. Regas talked about, a dispute that has been existing over the last several years between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| and the tavern about the approximately 78 shortage in sparking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:21| That dispute gets resolved as a result of this proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| That's an important item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| If it had been an obligation that was clearly owing, that obligation would have been addressed several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| The reality of it is it was not addressed and is finally put to bed as a result of all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| And we're certainly available to answer any questions that council may have on the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| I'm Jim Parris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I'm an attorney at Bernstein Stair and McAdams representing Riverside Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| My address is 4823 Old Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And I can only reiterate what Mr. Regas and Mr. Cox have already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| Ed is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| A deal is a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| But we don't feel that we have reached the deal that we were working for several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| And this is a good way to resolve any disputes and move on and let a good new restaurant come into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| I will be glad to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I think maybe Council might in a little while, but we'll go ahead and go to those speaking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| I have two folks signed up, Arthur Seymour, Jr. and Mike Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And you can go with whichever order you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Members of Council, my name is Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| My office address is 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| My residential address is 1805 Ridgecrest Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| I received a call this morning from Mr. Chase, who was somewhat alarmed by an article he read in the newspaper today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1969)|
| 0:33:00| about the Riverside Tavern getting a very good deal from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| We have been told, Mr. Chase and I, that the article was not in all respects correct, that it was not getting that good a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:17| He and I have been on the phone a good part of the day reviewing documents, trying to obtain documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| and looking at the ramifications of the deal that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| And let me say at the outset, and I'll come back to what we've discovered, let me say at the outset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Mr. Chase does not oppose Ruth Christmas, and he's not here trying to get rid of competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| He loves competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Fleming's Steakhouse out at Turkey Creek, which is equivalent to Ruth Chris, was there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| He's built one restaurant across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| He's about to build a second one across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So he's not afraid of Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Let him come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| It's great for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| It will be great for the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| What he thinks, though, is that everybody ought to play by the same rules that everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| He is paying or will be paying a one percent rental very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| Why shouldn't Riverside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| They said, well, we didn't get the deal we're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| We can't find documents that say they didn't get the deal they did before or that they were promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| at least any executed by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Mr. Chase and I would like to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Nevertheless, if you look at what will happen if you approve this deal tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| Riverside or Ruth Chris will not pay the city anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Well, it's alleged that is not really much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| It's 50 cents if they're doing $5 million, I mean $50,000 if they're doing $5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| But this thing goes on ad infinitum for the duration of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| What if they're doing $50 million in 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| They still don't pay the city anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| They're getting a free ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| They will never pay the city as long as Ruth Chris is in there under this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| But guess who is getting the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Riverside Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| They start off with $425,000 a year in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| That's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| The city ought to be getting some rent out of this also, the rent that they originally agreed to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| Assuming running the numbers further out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Riverside Partners will get $32 million in rental from Ruth Chris during the duration of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| if all the options are exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| That is more than enough to pay the $6.1 million that Mr. Cox alleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| that the partners already have invested in the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| By the way, on the parking issue, I go to Riverside quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| I've never had a problem parking over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| On Football Friday, it gets a little tight over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| But I've never left there because I couldn't find a parking spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| Mr. Chase wants me to emphasize that he's not doing this because he doesn't want Ruth Chris in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:22| He welcomes competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| But if you make a deal, you ought to keep your deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| He was promised verbally that he would have parking in this building for employees and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| during the term of his lease down on the riverfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| He hasn't had it for several years now, since 2001, but he's griped about it, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| But he continues to pay the rental to the city and will continue to do so in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| So what we would like to do is see this matter put off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| We would like to review the legal documents that allegedly give Riverside Tavern a claim against the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:12| for not furnishing parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| And we'd like to see a document that binds the city that is in default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| not that some developer made a promise some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| We would like to see all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| And we would like for this or have this matter turned down at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| Let Riverside adjust their rental from Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Let Ruth Chris pay the city one percent and let that come off Riverside's rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| They're still going to get easily their $6.1 million out of pocket back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| There's no harm in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Mr. Chase is here and can assure you, I hope, that everything I've said on his behalf is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| Would you like to speak, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| He's pretty much said everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| And he will be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| But if we start giving breaks to private enterprise that you give to one, you ought to give it to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| And if you're going to cancel their one percent, cancel Mike Chase's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| But he's not here asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| He's here proud to pay the city what he owes under his agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| and will continue to do so into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| But government shouldn't be in the business of bailing people out of bad business decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| This is the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| If Riverside Tavern is broke, which I don't think they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| based on how many people are over there at the times I go over there, let them go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| That's the right of anybody in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| But let them compete like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Don't give them an edge that other business people and other restaurateurs in this town do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| Mike Chase pays rent every place he is located in accordance with his lease agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| It's only fair that Ruth, Chris and Riverside do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Actually, the side speaking in favor has a chance to make any rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| You have three minutes if you'd like to make a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Excuse me, two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| And then we'll go to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| So if any one of you would like to speak for two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| Well, notice I've got two friends that oppose me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Arthur Seymour, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Arthur, you talk about honoring an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| That's what we're asking the city to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| The developer and the city said they'd give us 150 non-exclusive places and 150 exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| They did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| So that is they didn't deserve the 1% because they didn't honor their agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| So the law department has worked out a favorable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| And please don't postpone this because if you do, you say so long to Ruth, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| And I don't think that's good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And I think we've come up with a fair solution and I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| And, gentlemen, do you, the attorneys, do you have anything to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I saw Ms. Pelow's light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| I was going to ask Mr. Kaiser if he would like to comment on the statements that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Just some background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| This entire gateway village, it's a nine-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| It's actually owned by the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| TVA is the agency that administers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Back in 1995, I believe it was, TVA entered into an easement, a perpetual easement with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| granting the city a perpetual easement on that entire tract subject to certain restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| The tract was basically divided up in seven parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| The parcel we're talking about now is parcel number two, where Riverside Tavern is presently situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| Subsequent to the city receiving the perpetual easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| the city entered into a development agreement with Volunteer Landing Development, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| and then leased a number of these parcels, including this one, to VLD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| VLD, that lease was in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| The lease has an initial term of 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| With options, it can run for another 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| So starting in 1995, it could run 95 years out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| So we're 10 years, roughly 12 years into it, so it has another 83 years to go if all the options are exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| That lease was signed in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Then in 1998, Riverside Tavern by Regus, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| which is the entity that Mr. Regus and Mr. Parrish and Mr. Cox represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| acquired that lease from Volunteer Landing Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| The way the grant of easement with TVA is set up in that documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| TVA has to consent to any transfer of a leasehold interest or a sublease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| And also the city has the right to consent to any transfer of an interest in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| And the city did, in fact, at that time, consent to the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Basically, it was a sale of VLD's lease to Riverside in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| And Riverside is the tenant as to Track 2 for the duration of that lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| which would run another 83 years if all the options are exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| And then VLD has or, I'm sorry, Riverside has operated under that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Mr. Cox has already explained the capital investment that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| One of the documents that was executed was an amended and restated master use agreement between VLD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| and Riverside and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| And it creates some obligations on VLD's part pertaining to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Parking is problematic down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I've spent a good, since I've been involved working for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| I've spent a good deal of my time working on parking problems down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| It's a problem for all the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| They're basically in Riverside's track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| There are 150 spots that are exclusive to Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| And those sit basically in front of Riverside's premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| and also in front of the building just to the north of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and actually all the way up to the point where the Hill Avenue divide crosses the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| And then north of that location are 72 what are called public or non-exclusive parking spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| And those are basically public parking spots that are utilized by other tenants of Gateway, their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:15| The marina comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Folks who have slips in the marina, they have to use those slips because of the fact that the spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| the 150 spots in front of Riverside Tavern are exclusive to Riverside Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| And then, as I say, they're public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And if somebody wanted to park in those public spots and walk across the bridge and go to work at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| one of the office buildings, they have a right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| So there's a huge demand on parking down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| You know, sometimes I'm like Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I've gone down there and I hadn't had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| And sometimes I've gone down there and I've had a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| And it varies from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| But I will tell you that parking has been very problematic down there since I've been working for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| And I've spent a lot of time talking with the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| And during those conversations, claims have been asserted against the city in terms of the city's obligation to build parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| And the claims are largely based on interpretations of the lease agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| and also the amended and restated master lease agreement and the conversations that Mr. Regas has alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| And it's just not the problem has not been limited to Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| It's all the other tenants down there have had the same sorts of problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| The way the lease that Riverside holds under is structured, there are three components of rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| The first is common area maintenance rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| The second component is whereby they pay their proportionate share of common area maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| The second component is the payment of taxes, insurance and utilities instant to their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| And the third is percentage rent that Mr. Regas has alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| What the lease provides for is the percentage rent is after the fifth lease year, which kicked in, I believe, in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| It's one percent of gross sales, less sales tax, less complimentary mills, and also less common area maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| So the common area maintenance payment that Riverside makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| So just to run an example, if gross sales were $4 million, the percentage would be one percent would be $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| And if they had paid $20,000 in common area maintenance, that would be a credit to it, so they would owe $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| And that's the item that's being referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Now, Mr. Regas has worked hard to negotiate this agreement, sublease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| And, by the way, it is a sublease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| It is not, at this point, an assignment of Riverside's lease to Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| It is a sublease by Riverside of its leasehold interest to Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| And they've negotiated that or are in the process of negotiating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| And the issue of this percentage rent has come up in connection with those negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| And Riverside came and made a proposal about the city releasing Riverside of that obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| and also waiving it on a going forward basis so long as Ruth Chris was a tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| because that was an issue with Ruth Chris if they ever acquired that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| And, at that point, it's like any other or actually like all other real estate transactions the city gets involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| and there are a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| What we collectively as an administration try to do is to work the very best deal we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| cut the best deal we can, and then bring it to you and you counsel on real estate transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| You all have the final say on whether or not you think it's a good business deal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| But in terms of why I personally think it's a good business deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| there's a document that Riverside folks have already procured and it's signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| in escrow right now pending closing of this transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| but it's a document that's been signed by all the tenants of the gateway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| And in that document, it releases all these tenants release all their claims for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| that have accrued through the date of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| And they also agree, affirmatively agree, that the city has absolutely no obligation to provide additional parking in the gateway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| And they also agree to the extent the amended and restated master agreement may imply otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| that the lot three where parking was to be built could be used for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| And I will tell you that that is significant value to the city, because that relieves the city of those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:46| Can I put an exact dollar figure on that? No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| You know, additional parking would be significant to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| If we were sued by Riverside Tavern for loss of revenues, it's like any other lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| The outcome is unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the possible judgment range is unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| But this just eliminates, frankly, a lot of headaches and a lot of legal uncertainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| that's been brewing around down there for quite some time, at least as long as I've been working for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| In addition to that release, the city also gets a nationally recognized restaurant that Mr. Regas has spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:28| I've never had the opportunity to eat at one, but I hear they're very excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| I think it would be great for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| I hear Mr. Regas talk about whether or not Riverside will be staying open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I'm concerned what would happen to that location if it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| That would create an element of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| I am told that national chains could really help us with, you know, convention center draw and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| And, you know, hopefully there would be a significant amount of sales tax that could be generated by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=2992)|
| 0:50:01| To the issue of the alleged windfall that these partners are receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| I think Mr. Cox has discussed that and the fact that they're really going to be paying a lot of debt in connection with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| Mr. Seymour raises the point that if Ruth Chris is there the entire length of the term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| that the partners will put a whole lot more money in their pocket than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Well, you know, the Ruth Chris lease has an initial term of 15 years with five five-year extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| which may or may not be exercised by Ruth Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| So Riverside Tavern continues to run the risk of the successful operation of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| In addition to all these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| one of the things I wanted and Riverside has delivered on this is for Ruth Chris to agree in its sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| that the city has no future obligation to add any more parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| and that its employees will park in their dedicated spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| which is very important because that continues to free up these public parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| And Ruth Chris has also agreed that four spots in front of the building just to the north of Riverside Tavern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| which would be the building currently occupied by Stokes and Rutherford Law Firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| that four spots in front of that building, which are currently exclusive to Riverside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| could be used on weekdays during daytime, 730 to 430, by the occupants of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| So those are the considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Again, it's a business judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Again, I've tried to negotiate the best thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I think it makes business sense because it resolves some real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Ultimately, it's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I'm not sure who the next slide was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| I'm going to go to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| I just want to say I met with Mr. Regas on site, and I appreciate everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| and I certainly appreciate attempting to get a good-faith dispute amicably settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| I don't have an issue with the parking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I have a little bit of an issue with the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Let me ask, I guess, Mr. Kaiser this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| All disputes aside over parking, how much rent on average should Riverside be paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| I don't know how much they should be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| All I can tell you is what they agreed to pay in their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Mr. Regas, do you happen to know, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| All disputes aside, how much should Riverside Tavern be paying the city in rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:34| The agreement was 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| We purchased the leasehold rights for $875,000 in, I think it was 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| And we put all of the money into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| It was all the Riverside Tavern's money in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| And it's not like an arm's-length lease where you, as a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| built a suit with a complete building and then charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Well, you're naturally going to charge more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| What I'm asking is if the parking wasn't in dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| how much is 1% of your gross proceeds a year that should be paid to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I think Mr. Kaiser hit it right on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| He said if you're doing $4 million, that would be $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| and then you get credit for the CAM, the common area maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| which is about $20,000 or $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So then the city would be entitled to $15,000 or $20,000 a year if they had honored their commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| which they didn't on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| I'm trying to ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| It's a big issue, but I'm trying to work around that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Hopefully we don't ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| I'll try to answer what question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Did you mean if a developer would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| I think you answered his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| The $20,000 was the basic close to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| So I guess it isn't necessarily a question for you or Mr. Paris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| If Ruth Chris is willing to pay $425,000 a year in rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:24| and do in excess of $1 million worth of renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| there's, I mean, and they're not willing to pay 1% to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| I mean, they're paying $425,000 for this, you know, it's a fine facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| but they're going to do all this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| I'm having trouble connecting where it's not possible to pay the city $30,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| $40,000 in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| No, they said they wouldn't pay the 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Ruth Chris said they wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And we've put the investment in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| and we're entitled to the rent that we were able to negotiate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| and the city is not entitled to the 1% because they didn't honor the parking commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| And it's as simple as that in the way we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| I, again, think that what Mr. Kaiser said, that this has been an ongoing issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| It just popped up here the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| but it's at least three years that we've been trying to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| And I think this is a good solution for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Mr. Bate, I'm not sure who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I apologize if I'm out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| You know, it sounds like there's a lot of details to this and a long, long history to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| and it really boils down to not very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| I think that's what Councilman Frost was getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| It's $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, which, you know, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| But in the scheme of things, it seems like something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| there ought to be some sort of way to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| And, you know, this is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| I met with Mr. Regas, and Mr. Kaiser makes a good business case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| But, you know, the concern about subsidizing any business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| or giving any business an unfair advantage, I'm not so sure that that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| but that issue was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| But, you know, I'm always concerned, you know, that we're making the most out of the assets we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| So having one vote up here, that's sort of what I'm trying to figure out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| is this good for the taxpayer and is this, you know, a good use of the asset as it comes before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:54| I wanted to know, Mr. Kaiser, where you think the parking lot issue, parking spot issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3414)|
| 0:57:04| what sort of path that's on, if that's not resolved, where do you think that would ultimately end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| I mean, is that just going to continue to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I'm frankly surprised they haven't filed a lawsuit yet, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Mr. Seymour asked earlier about some documents and wanted some extra time to possibly look over those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| and said they're not available, that they've disappeared or they're not around anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| You know, Mr. Seymour, which documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| I don't mean to jump in, but Mr. Parris has some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| He showed me before the meeting, if that might help folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| I just asked him, where is a document that legally obligates the city of Knoxville to provide the parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| that you allege you're entitled to down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And he said, it's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| And it was a big stack of documents like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| And I said, surely there's one document in there that's signed by the mayor after approval by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| that authorizes the city to or obligates the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| We're talking about an obligation to the city to provide this parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| There may be one out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I just haven't found it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| It's a number of things have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| One document in particular that's talked about is the amended and restated master use agreement where VLD has some obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| And arguments are made that the city is allegedly responsible for VLD's, its developer's failure to provide that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:42| Those are allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Those are claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Again, where those would end up in a lawsuit is an unpredictable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| You know, there are conversations that are alluded to, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| Mr. Hall, we'll just go back and forth, and we'll come to Mr. Becker next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Well, I think I just got my question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| It was about the lease, about the spaces that the city would need to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| So am I to understand there's not something that really, like Mr. Seymour said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| that states that the city is to provide these extra 150 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| It's just sort of questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I think it's questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| It's debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| It's an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Both sides have their arguments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| If it were clear one way or the other, if it were clear, I think we may not have had the dispute for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| But because of the possible ambiguity on these questions and also arguments from the Riverside folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:42| about the city's potential liability for VLD's failure to perform, that's why this debate continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| And it would be great to get it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I think it would be in everybody's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Just continuing that question about this document that says we're responsible for some parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| Is it your mind, Mr. Kaiser, that there's enough of a legal argument there that we could lose in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| I mean, it's one of these that you're feeling like this is not a – it really isn't a document that doesn't say we'd win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| but you feel like we stand a significant chance of losing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| Since this whole thing is subject to your approval, and if you don't approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I would hate to have this read back to me in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I hope you appreciate my answer in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| But I will tell you there's enough of an issue there that it bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| I've got a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| And that there is a – I will, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| I probably should have asked that question, and I should assume that and allow you to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| I'll try and do that next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| I will publicly deny all liability, but I will tell you there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| I guess just one other quick point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Mr. Regas, you said you've got a June 15th deadline, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| So the idea of postponing to our June 19th meeting would not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| It would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| I tended to – I met with Mr. Regas again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| This felt good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| And at about 5 o'clock this afternoon I had a phone call that got some wheels turning in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| I would have loved to have been able to say let's postpone it and think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| but that's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| It feels a little bit to me like some of this – I mean, I think Councilman Bailey was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| that it's not really a whole lot of money in the big scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| The waterfront is real valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| I think the idea of this being a vacant building would be a significant blow to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| The interesting part that came to my mind with this phone call is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| the issue of somebody who built a restaurant downtown that's having parking problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| if you would ask 1,000 Knoxvillians who that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I think most of them would probably say somebody other than Riverside Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| And I think, you know, Calhoun's has clearly had significant problems with this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| And I guess one question is we seem to be doing some work to settle a parking issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| with Riverside Tavern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| We have a similar parking issue with Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And I guess I just want to ask what are the thinking that we can do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| to satisfy the parking problems that they're suffering through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Well, we've taken a first step in that in reopening the garage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| The deck level is open at night, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Well, let me just continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Other ideas, other thinking on how we deal with that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| because it does feel like this has been a – I mean, I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| This is embarrassing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Sometimes when I've gone to Riverside Tavern, I've parked at Calhoun's and walked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| So, you know, it's a little embarrassing to admit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| but it reflects some of the parking problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Mike, his tag number is 384-296.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| But Mr. Regals will pay to get your car back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I don't – I don't know who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And I don't mean to make light of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| and I'm looking out in the audience that has joined us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| and I can't help but see some other people who have parking issues and property concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| And having spent a better part of one afternoon with all three of you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| the marina and the volunteer princess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| and those happen to be some favorites of mine because I just love the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| I love the boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| So I know that you're all faced with some real issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| and I think some type of resolution to this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| which will give all of you some relief so you're not in this face-to-face disagreement and need for the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:54| I've been there, gosh, I don't know how many times, in the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| because a number of organizations we belong to have large groups there in the evenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and parking is a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| And that has been a major part of the business for the Riverside Tavern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| whether it will be for Ruth's, Chris's, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| But, you know, I see a number of people that have a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| I know – I can recall when Mike Chase made the decision to go into business there and establish Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| And there was, as I emailed him today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| involved with that decision and with the way that all worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| And it's one of my other favorite places to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| although I confessed to him that I'd rather be at the Copper Cellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| But, you know, I also am concerned about the parking along the riverfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| We have parking issues all over town, as Councilman Becker has very validly pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| It's a concern for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| But I have to look at that property and concern myself with having a vacant property along the river there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| and the impact that could have on the marina and the other properties down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| and the safety that could be at issue on that Riverside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| So in looking at that, I really think I almost want to congratulate Mr. Kaiser for the work he's done on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:30| because it's a longstanding difficult situation for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| So I almost want to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| I didn't mean that the way it sounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| But, you know, that might not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| But you don't want to be involved in this in any way, Mr. Kaiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| But I do appreciate the hard work that has gone into trying to resolve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| That's a concern for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| And the fairness issue is, of course, a great concern to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| because these are wonderful downtown businesses that mean a great deal to the vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| and the health and the excitement of downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| So it's not a matter of taking sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| It's a matter of trying to look at the big picture and see that everyone is given consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| And that's the challenge before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| This might come out the wrong way, but, you know, we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| and we're talking about a bad parking situation and he said, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| but if the parking situation is so bad we've got somebody willing to pay $425,000 a year to have that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:39| I mean, that's a question I don't think anyone here can answer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| But I'm sitting here thinking about the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| And, you know, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| I don't know how to design parking lots or put anything in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| But if you do 70 parking spaces at $40,000 each, and that's a lot of money for a parking space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| that's about, that's under $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| I mean, is this a problem that can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Actually, I think you need to redo that math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| You missed a decimal place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Oh, I missed a decimal place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| So I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| But, I mean, if we, I mean, is this something that, I mean, the amount of income because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| I like the homegrown businesses like that are there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| Is this something that, you know, that we should, if we have this obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| we should take care of this obligation versus settling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| I just was going to answer Councilman Frost's speculation as to why Ruth's Chris might be willing to enter into this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| And I don't know to what extent their hours of operation might affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| But my understanding is that they intend at this point to be an evening-only restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| And perhaps the difficulty with the parking has been primarily during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| But that certainly might affect that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Mr. Becker, I think you had a follow-up for Ms. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| It was sort of an interesting, Ms. Frost, if I heard what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| what you were saying is for the amount of money we're giving up in the 1% here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| we could actually build a parking garage to fix the parking problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Is that something that you're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I don't know if surface parking is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| I mean, if we're able to create surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Surface parking is obviously a lot less expensive than, you know, building a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| I don't know, you know, I don't know how to site one and where we could locate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Well, you know, essentially you have $40,000 and it still didn't come up for 70 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| and it still didn't come up to that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And my sense is, you know, $40,000 or $50,000 actually is a parking garage per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| Actually a little less than that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| A little less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, it's kind of some interesting math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I think it's about $25,000 per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| In all the discussion about this, was that ever talked about as saying, well, could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| As Morris said, we've had these discussions really since we've been in office for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| We've talked about everything down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| It's an interesting idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| It's been an interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| I heard people alluding to an e-mail today that I guess went out from Mr. Chase, which I haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| I was down at the council office and my computer at my office is on a glitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| so I hadn't had a chance to read what the history is that they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| You know, I find it interesting that we're here having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| And I guess I'm going to go to an area that Mr. Seymour said they weren't interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| an area that I'm sure the administration may not like for me to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| But I do think that this sounds like, from talking to Mr. Kaiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| that this may be a good deal for the citizens and for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| for us to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| But I also think that it does open up a situation where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| in light of the problems that Mr. Chase has had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| and in light of the fact that he's about to go into this same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| that somebody may need to be thinking about the future discussions with Mr. Chase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| and how to remedy the fact that he's had some parking situations that weren't his fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| that were cut off from him, and he's going to be forced to have to pay a 1% here in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| And I don't know if you all are considering that, and it opens up some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| But it sounds to me like someone needs to be talking to Mr. Chase about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| how do we maybe, if we're going to set this precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| work with you and your deal to make sure a restaurateur who has several restaurants in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| providing a lot of good services, and I think Ruth Chris would be a great tourist attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| but so is Calhoun's and the barbecue and the world-famous barbecue, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| Just as Rega said, so while I think this may be something we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| I think this opens up an opportunity for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| and I would encourage the administration to sit down and have some discussions with Mr. Chase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| and his people about recognizing the fact that for the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| he's been in and went out some parking that was very beneficial to his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| could be very beneficial to it in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| and that he's going to have some outlay that he's going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| And maybe we can, while it's not the initial bargain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| this may be a precedent that would allow us to maybe negotiate a better situation for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| So I hope we'll take that opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| When I hear that we may get $20,000 a year, $30,000 a year, you know, rent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| when I think about what Ruth Chris may do here in sales tax and tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| I think that may be offset and much better than having an empty shell there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| or having to do a TIF or a pilot for somebody to come in down there to do something else in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| So I'm looking at it beyond, and I know that Mr. Seymour did not answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| He said it's not something that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| I haven't talked to Mr. Chase, haven't read the e-mail, so I can say here on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| he hasn't asked me to throw that question out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| But I do think we owe it to him maybe to have that kind of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| because he has for years had a real problem that I've passed resolutions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| and other council members about opening up this parking garage here for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| So I would encourage us to engage in those kind of discussions if his contract is about to kick in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| for him to have to start paying that 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Let me go ahead, Mr. Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Maybe you can address it, but I just wanted to go on the record to say I agree with Vice Mayor Brown's sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| I think it's a good package that we're looking at right now, a good agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| But I think it's only fair to also talk to Mr. Chase about whatever agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:30| formal or otherwise, we've had in the past and to explore how we can honor that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| I mean, we're always willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| And Mike and I have had conversations over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Like I said, that's why we're glad to get at least the deck open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| I don't think it totally satisfies Mike and his desires that he'd have to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| but I think it's a start in terms of a place for people to park that you can get in and out free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And we're obviously going to look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| We don't have tons of options, as everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| There's no more land down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And we have the city, everybody knows the city, county parking garage in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| We won't go into all that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| But we're willing to look at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I mean, that business is a valuable business to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We appreciate them being there and want to see something work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| Just one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Because I think that it's very important that we make sure that we secure the future of this side of the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| We're talking about going across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| How does it look going across the river, spending all that money, and we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| We see folk closing down or things changing or the character even changing right across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| So I think it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we secure it and keep a good viable business there, satisfied and happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| and also bring another opportunity there if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| You know, it doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I think we would not look to be doing the best job we could do if we have problems there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| but we're trying to build this great south mouth waterfront we're all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Yes, I have to agree with Vice Mayor Brown when it talks about making things sort of on equal footing with Mr. Chase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| compared to what we're proposing to do here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| I think that would just be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| And it goes a lot along with what Councilman Bailey said about not wanting to give a lot of favorable treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| to one business versus the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| And I think since I'm sure if it's $20,000 to Ruth Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| it's probably something in that price range probably too with Mr. Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| And so it probably shouldn't be a tremendous impact on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| And I think that's a good idea to look at doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Let me just comment real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| And this has been great feedback and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| This is obviously a longstanding and hard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| You know, the traditional role of the city is to we collect revenue through property tax and sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| and business tax and license and we spend it on stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Every now and then we find ourselves in the real estate business, though we may or may not think of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| We're in the real estate development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| And then the administration's job, and whether it's a transit center location, a movie theater, working out this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| our job is to go negotiate the best deal that we think we can for the citizens and taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| and taking everything into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And so we go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| And then your job, like Morris said, is to say we think that's a good deal or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| You all are the board of directors that vote on that's a good deal or it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| And so that's the role we play and that's why we recommend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| But I think it's fair to say are we doing a government subsidy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| I think it's a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| We're playing a real estate role here and we're trying to represent the citizens' assets the best way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| to get the best return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| And that's why we, I mean, could we have squeezed harder on the guys from Riverside Tavern and gotten a better deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| On the other hand, maybe they say forget it and the thing goes dark and everybody has a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| You know, everybody can look back at somebody else's negotiations and say, well, you should have done this, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| We think, given everything we know, given the parking situation, given the additional revenue we think we'll get out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| given the fact that the owners by their own admissions business is going downhill and they have some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| we think dollars and cents wise this is the best thing for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| And so that's why we recommend it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| But, again, our job is to recommend, say we think this is the best deal, and your job is to say, yeah, your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| So, Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Haslund, Mayor Haslund, you just reminded me when you smiled when I was about to congratulate our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| I was just afraid he was going to quit over the parking down there for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| Well, it occurs to me that there might be another individual very involved in those negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| And, you know, you stated it so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| We are in the real estate business whether we want to be or not, and we have to make hard decisions that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| We have really, gosh, when people speak to me about what's going on in Knoxville right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| there's just so many positive things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| It's exciting to have positive feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| And we don't hear the word Chattanooga and some ugly things like that like we used to hear a great deal when I first came on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| So it's wonderful to know that really positive things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And you all have made, your team has made some wonderful decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| and negotiated some very good arrangements for us, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| and brought before this council some things that we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Well, I do have to just comment, I'm sure everyone would, that I'm in total agreement with Councilman Woodhull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| and Councilman Brown, the comments they made about Mr. Chase and his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I have long known Mr. Chase and have really enjoyed a lot of relationships we've had over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| And I recall soundly the difficulties that he faced when he opened his business down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:40| And I think to some extent we've tried to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| But I can't say that that's a closed book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| And I would appreciate continued discussions with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| and seeing how we can make this entire north side of the riverfront as successful as we hope the south side will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Anybody else like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Ms. Hitch, why don't you just do this one by roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4682)|

| 1:18:22| Motion passes six to two. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| under the Burn Justice Assistance Grant Program, formerly the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4713)|

| 1:19:52| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Mr. Haslam, I would like to offer an amendment and make this a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| I would like to amend 11J by including that this be subject to the approval of this plan by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4798)|
| 1:20:08| I believe this is before the Knox County Commission as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| and I think wisdom would be wise if both groups approved the same plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I'll second for Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Any discussion on that on the amendment now is what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Yeah, I mean, so you'd say we won't adopt this plan unless they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| Or, I mean, I'm just trying to, it doesn't feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| I'm just wondering why we don't just step out and do it, why are we making contingent on their taking action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| I think what we would like to do is adopt the same plan, and so the same plan would be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| So what you say, if the county then does something a little different, we could come back and adopt what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| I think it's also a good encouragement just to say this is something that ought to apply across the board or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| Our borders change from time to time, and so it would seem that this is a wise thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| We're just thinking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Any other discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Now voting on the motion as amended, any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Twelve A's in ordinance to annex certain territory joining the bounds of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| an area generally being described as several tracts of land east and west of Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| and the right-of-way of Washington Pike from the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| to the northeastern right-of-way line of Murphy Road and the right-of-way of McCampbell Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| from Washington Pike southwest approximately 485 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| which property is to be incorporated into the limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| and to revise the boundary of Ward 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| I just wanted to say I talked to Mr. Emmett earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| This is the thing that we postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| and he thought this might need to be postponed for two weeks as well because this is a companion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| But if they want to go ahead and figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Mr. Jernigan, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| My name is Victor Jernigan, 108 Stecoya Lane, S-T-E-K-O-I-A Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:22| And certainly we would agree with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| We don't have any problem with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| We understand you just got the ordinance in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| It's on Friday, and everybody needs time to take time to digest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| But we would like to have the annexation and the ordinance heard at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| so a postponement on this we would certainly appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| So you want to postpone it now even though you passed things out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| The reason we passed them out was because hopefully if anybody has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| this part of what we're going to be discussing in the ordinance is an improvement to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| That matches up with the TDOT road plans, which were discussed by David Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| You've got a copy on the CD of the actual TDOT road plan that was proposed originally for all the work in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:08| There was an article from the Hall Shopper where Mr. Hill had spoken about the need to spend the money to get Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| improved or the gift from the state would be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| So I'm happy to meet with anybody at any time in the next two weeks to discuss any portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| I'll meet one-on-one, or we'll schedule a meeting, a workshop, anything that anybody would like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| because I really do believe it's a wonderful opportunity for both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| and the county to move forward with a fantastic project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| I was going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks, but I see lights are on, so I won't make it to cut off people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| If you'd like to go ahead and make it, then we can have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| We can have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| I'll make that motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Was that a second, Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Now, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| I'm glad Mr. Jernigan agrees with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I'm glad to see this is coming about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| This is something that I don't mean to speak on issues in Councilman Frost's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| It's very close to mine, and I've been in some of those meetings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| We've been trying for years to get this thing rolling through TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and it's a big need to get this stuff done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| So I'm glad you passed this out in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Hopefully there will be some good discussions over the next couple of weeks to iron out whatever issues that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| because this needs to occur out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| And I know a lot of folk in the community want to see it occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Yeah, I guess just on the postponement, the item we postponed is a resolution, so it's a one-reading item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| So we actually could pass this, which is a two-reading item, on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| and then do them both at the next meeting if there's a need for speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| We wouldn't need to do the final test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Do you understand what he's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| I do, but on this particular one, there's not a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| We've been negotiating this for several months and months and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| so to postpone and have them both go together I think is the appropriate way for this to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| A delay, I'm perfectly happy to meet and have the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I don't feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| I just wanted to make sure we were aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| Yeah, that's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Well, I received a phone call today, and in having that very lengthy discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| I realized that there were some questions which I felt had been answered to my satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| but which apparently were not clear to the caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| And I think I want to thank you for accepting the willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| to postpone for two weeks because I think that those questions can all be clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| to the extent that they're going to be for that caller and for the people that she represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| So I think basically this is going to be a smoother road for us all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| and I have to agree with Councilman Brown that these are much-needed improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| that have been talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| So I think it's a good thing that we hold up two weeks and then move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| And, again, I'm easy to get a hold of, so anyone that would like to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| you can schedule a meeting with Rick Emmett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| and I'd be happy to meet at any time with Mr. Emmett or anyone else for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5162)|

| 1:27:54| Jeff Tallman signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Jeff, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| Thank you very much, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| This is, in my view, a strategically critical ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| I don't think there's going to be any opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| but I just want to take a moment to bring out why this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| And, Mayor, you and I, on our bicycle ride through Lonsdale back last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| November, had a chance to briefly speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| And I want to commend Mark Donaldson and MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| They've been very responsive in terms of looking at the issues, the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| crafting language that addresses the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| And the need is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| We have, based upon staff assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| about 300 to 400 legal nonconforming use residences strategically located within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| the core of our community that we are on record as being committed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| redevelopment of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Now, what that means is we essentially have housing where it's been housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| looks like housing, people live in it as housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and housing precedes typically the zoning post-World War,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| which basically changed the use from residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| which was the pattern to industrial, office, commercial, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| Now, because of the legal nonconforming use status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| what that means is that you can live there as a house grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| you can buy the property for cash, but you can't get a mortgage on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| So what that basically means is that we condemn these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| and I'm not going to belabor where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| but they're really in critical locations and strategically critical locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| And let me belabor it for a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| Along the Central Avenue corridor that we've just had a lot of discussion in energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| the housing, just about everything to the west of Central is C3 or I2 or I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| I'm not up on all the designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| All I know is you can't get a mortgage on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| And so what we end up with is essentially a squatter zone, which is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| We don't allow the positive civics of allowing homeownership so that people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| wake up every day thinking about it, planting flowers, picking up trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| calling the law enforcement when there's something going wrong, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| In fact, one of the important areas is along the Mitchell Street corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| and the railroad tracks where we had a very, very tragic incident on Chipman Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| And I would actually argue that because we create these permanent marginal areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| that that's the sort of activity that we should expect for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| It's because nobody's a stakeholder, nobody treats it like they own it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| and so it's just often some other buddies land over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| Typically it's owned by somebody who's a more sophisticated real estate person in another part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| And I don't think that's healthy for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| You've got another in the 12 series of ordinances, 12K on Irwin and Silver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| That's just right behind KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| That entire section of housing there is C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| You can live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| It sort of looks like a neighborhood, but you can't be a homeowner there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| because if the house burns down, you can't replace it as a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| because residential is not the highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| So this is a great and I think a very elegant piece of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| maybe the most elegant piece of legislation that will ever come through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| The beauty of it is that we open the door to something we want to see more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| that being residential, but we do not close the door on somebody else's interest in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| And that's rare in government that you're able to create an and-and, win-win scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| In the neighborhood where I live with Councilman Frost, we have the entire block of Luttrell Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:51| between 3rd and 4th Avenue, C3, and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| A great piece of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Appreciate staff and appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5516)|

| 1:32:31| Now we'll discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Mr. Swanson and I had an in-depth conversation today about some potential flaws in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I'd like to call on Mr. Swanson to discuss the flaws and the potential ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| That was going to be my second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| I would like to mention to you on my behalf and also on behalf of members of the Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| that we have some real concerns about this particular piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| We are concerned that it is not quite as elegant a piece of legislation yet as it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:04| because if you look at the administration section and then move on over to page four of that administration section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:12| at the very bottom, it says, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| that any person aggrieved by any decision of the Design Review Board may appeal that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| to the Board of Zoning Appeals within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| The Board of Zoning Appeals is a creation of a state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| and that state statute very specifically sets out what the Board of Zoning Appeals does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| and what the Board of Zoning Appeals doesn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| and there is really no authority of the city to create additional responsibilities of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| And this does attempt to create an additional responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| or obligation of the Board of Zoning Appeals, which is not authorized by state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| and, therefore, I would believe to be inconsistent with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| If you go on and look at that a little further, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Appeal from the City of Knoxville Board of Zoning Appeals shall be as provided by Section 135 of the Knoxville City Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| There is no Section 135 of the Knoxville City Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| For that reason, I would believe that we need to add a little more elegance to this piece of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| and so I would suggest to the council that you refer this back to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| and let them do a little more work on it and then come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| I was going to ask Mr. Donaldson, I mean, do you care to respond about the deficiencies and the lack of elegance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:47| Let me say that we weren't attempting to amend that part that you just cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| other than adding the word zoning in front of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| It's language that's been in there since the inception of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| We can work to simplify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| I mean, I think everybody wants to see this happen, but they want to see it happen the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Just one other thing, and I know people have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| but it seems like a lot of these things that we are doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| and I'll save it for next time my speech about another layer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| but I also know that here we're now putting another cost factor onto the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| that ultimately somebody is going to have to end up putting in their coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| You know, when we are now by this document saying that you all will provide the staffing assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| and perform some functions, I know you're not going to do that for free, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| and typically the things that you do for us we put into a work document and work plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| and you're compensated for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| So I would encourage this council and those folk who kind of come up with these ideas to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| as we continue to put more on MPC and its staff situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| we have to turn around and fund these things and these activities for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| and we must be very careful not to inadvertently do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| And then I'll save my speech for additional layers of government for after we bring it back next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5770)|

| 1:37:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Councilman Becker, we do have someone sign up to speak on this, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| We should hear them first, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Mackie Brownlee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I think that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| Am I in the wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Did I have the wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| You're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Mackie was ready to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| I bet Mackie supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| You have 12I, but it must be a different item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Anyway, there's no one to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| No one signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Mackie, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| It used to be an L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5851)|

| 1:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| I was going to say Mackie got another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Councilman Becker now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| I want to do two quick things on that, three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| One, just to remind folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| this is something that came up a couple months ago, got referred back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| so we could put the guidelines in the current sector plan into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| which has been done really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| I don't know if the applicant's present, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| but I just want to take a second to thank him for being willing to put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| with the discussions that's happened on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| I know you've been frustrated at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| but you've been willing to accept the public involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| and that's great for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Have you ever felt like, well, we might have been upsetting you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| you weren't showing it to people, and it made things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| and this is really good, and I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| I'd also like to, since this has been talked about so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| I don't want to make it an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| but I would like to amend it to eliminate the 17-day waiting period if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I'm worried about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Well, that part, that never affects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| The 17-day waiting period, I don't understand why we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| There's a motion to amend the 17-day waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| And let me do that for, I don't know, Mr. Swanson, if this is legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| but to do it for 12-J as well the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| I think you'll have to do it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| You'll have to do it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| There's a motion to say any comment on the amendment to waive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| 7-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=5929)|

| 1:40:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Mr. Seymour is here representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Would you all like to speak first or hear Mr. Seymour first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| I was just going to respond to questions, Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| I received a call from Councilman Roddy today about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| I discussed this with Councilman Becker before the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| Your issue, I think, was the buffering along Shasta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| Similar to Mr. Becker's question, I was able to reach Mr. Turley after late, late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:21| I think you all may have already started your beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| He said he is happy to comply with all the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| and any suggestions you all have regarding buffering along Shasta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| And I'm going to talk to Mr. Donaldson about that between this meeting and the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| We're leaving Shasta Drive, the strip there, office that was to line it up with the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:53| I'll go to Councilman Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| This is another very similar situation to the one we just dealt with on Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| This is an area that's come up and was talked extensively about in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| that's currently being printed at MPC, and eventually we'll get to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| The way we've chosen to deal with Shasta in the sector plan is to have on the north side of Shasta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| to have a setback from the road with some landscaping, some planning to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| And then because Shasta is the road that runs parallel to Cedar, the lots are fairly small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| If we're going to have commercial development on Cedar, it's going to encroach back on the Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| We've got a buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| As I understand it, and Mr. Donaldson, check this and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| but the buffer that is in this rezoning, which is leaving some of it as, I guess, an office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| is the same buffer that we have for the rest of the street and is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| The one addition we've got in the sector plan is a requirement for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| If we can get an agreement that the applicant will do, you know, the trees, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| consistent with what the sector plan recommends, I'm willing to accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| I'm authorized to state that we concur with that and we'll do what is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| Councilwoman Ruddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| And also, I appreciate input from other council members on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| My question to Mr. Seymour this afternoon was, first of all, is the depth of this setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| I understand it's equivalent to Pelea's restaurant next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| but we had a situation at the other end of the block with a convenience store company here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| and they were asked for a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| And I'd like to make sure that if this is the route that we're going, that it's consistent along the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| I was not able to obtain that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| Mr. Donaldson, do you recall that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| I would say that within a few feet it is comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| Around the order of 50 to 60 feet of O1 zoning staying in place on both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| And does the sector plan have any specifics regarding not only landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| screening for the neighborhood on the other side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| but screening and protection in terms of dumpsters and trash receptacles and shaded lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| and that kind of thing so that you don't have the light pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| and some of those issues back into the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| The plan provides guidance in that direction, but doesn't specify any standards at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| So we would need to develop those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| I appreciate, Mr. Seymour, your client's willingness to be a good neighbor in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| and I'm willing to approve this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| I guess I'd like to hear maybe some more specifics from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| I know that they don't have a tenant designated yet to lease this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| and I would just like some assurance that the end result is going to be satisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| and consistent with what this council demanded of the last applicant that came in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| for a similar rezoning at the other end of the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| I'd better look at that before I make a blanket statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| because I was not able to get that information on what you all put on Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| but I will do so between now and the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6310)|

| 1:47:58| Requested by Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| We do have several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Mr. Frost, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Just real briefly, I guess this is for either the Law Director or MPC Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| Okay, we're voting tonight whether or not to have, continue a moratorium, postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| to another meeting, or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| If we pass the moratorium, what can be accomplished while that moratorium is in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| I want to, you know, I'm hearing we can't do this thing, we can't do this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| I want to see where we're going with this if we're going to vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| I would actually ask Mr. Swanson to address that since he drafted this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:51| Actually, I mean, the moratorium is exactly what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| It's a moratorium on the issuance of building permits for these particular parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| So what could not be done if you extend the moratorium either for the period of time that's listed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| or any other period of time is that one could not apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| and receive a building permit during that effective dates of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:22| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| You ready to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| Okay, you want to hear from the crowd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| Mr. Donaldson looks like he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| First off, the question was what could be accomplished during a moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Sixty days, little or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| It would take longer than that to amend a zoning code if the community would choose to go down the path of an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| or something like that that would have design standards put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| It would take us at least 90 days to get that through and back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:06| So are we really talking, I mean, if we pass this tonight, we're probably going to be back attempting to extend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:15| just to get through the rezoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| That really depends on the purpose for which you adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I mean, you have to have some reason to adopt the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| and you want something to be happening while the moratorium is in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| and it depends on what you want to be happening while the moratorium is in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| as to whether you would come back for an extension or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| You okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Yeah, go ahead, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| You know, I've talked to Mr. Swanson and Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| and, you know, there's a lot of issues, serious issues, I think, associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| And if we need to, we can get into the speakers and hear both sides of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| But it's my impression, my understanding, that if we have a moratorium for 14 days or 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| that this property owner will always have the vested right to develop it as it currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| I believe under the current zoning code and subdivision regulations that some of the lots that were created by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:24| ward map have a right to develop a house if they can demonstrate access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:33| and they can do that through a platting process rather than a zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| And I don't know that we can take that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Okay, so this is not a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| It's a platting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| I believe that it is primarily a platting issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| although there is an element of the zoning code that applies that gives that right to develop a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6715)|
| 1:52:04| But that exists now to change the code later would make the current situation legal nonconforming, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:13| and basically grandfather that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Okay, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Having heard that, what I would be interested in hearing from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| the speakers that are signed up is what benefit is a moratorium going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| I guess in a way I think I have similar questions to what Councilman Bailey has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| I guess my question is a little broader from what I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| I'd sort of like to hear what the problem is that people think it will fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| because at some level I think there are people who feel like there's something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| and they've got this as a solution, and it might not be the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| So at some level I think there's still confusion about what the problem is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Having heard that, and I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| And then the third part of that is who's going to take the leadership on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| Ownership or leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Questions have been posed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| We'll now hear from the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Those speaking in favor will go first in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Greg Congleton, Rachel Craig, and Gary Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| If you'd give us your name and address, and everyone has five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| because there's three on each side, it would be great if you could keep to the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| My name is Greg Congleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| I live at 2101 Spence Place, which is within the moratorium area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:33| I'm sure you may recall that I spoke in favor of the moratorium at the last city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| and at that meeting Councilman Holquist sort of sprung that all on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| and I think a few of you were, shall we say, a little miffed at that surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| I know Mr. Sokala, the property owner, didn't like that surprise, was upset by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| I understand the potential buyer was upset by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| And what happened in the neighborhood was a few weeks ago the neighborhood was surprised to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| that there were three buildable lots behind Mr. Sokala's property, and they were all upset by that surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:15| So there's been a lack of clear and accurate information about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| and that's generated a lot of heat but very little light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| The Sokalas have moved out of the neighborhood and are looking to get as much money as they can out of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| and I do not fault them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| That's certainly within their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| There's a lot of factors in play that have made that property much more valuable recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| and it's probably going to make my taxes go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| I'm not here to advocate violating anybody's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| I'm not asking anybody to violate mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| But there is this issue of these old lot lines, and I know most of you, if not all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| have received a copy of this MPC map that shows that there's lines going across lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:10| And so the problem is, with those lines, nobody seems to know exactly what the property rights are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| And so what I want out of a moratorium to answer the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| let's have some time to let MPC and maybe law come forward and tell everyone in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:29| not just the property owners in that section, because this issue affects more than the people in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:36| Tell everyone in the neighborhood, where do we stand with those old lines and those new lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| What can be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| What can't be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| You've already heard that there may be some buildable lots there, and we may have some access to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| I don't think the moratorium is adversely going to affect anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| I'm surprised to hear that one couldn't apply for a building permit during that moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| because the language says you just can't issue one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| It seems to me you could still apply for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| So getting down to specifics, if there was a moratorium, who would be harmed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| Certainly not me or anybody else that wants to build in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| because we're not looking to build, so we're not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| The seller is not looking to build, so I don't see how he is harmed by the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:30| The buyer is not. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| I don't see how the buyer is going to be harmed by a 60-day moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| because given all the issues with trying to get access, it's going to take them more than 60 days to get that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| and that joint easement and all of that stuff in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| What I'm looking for is some clarification so everybody in the neighborhood understands what. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| I want a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Now, who might be helped if that moratorium was put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| Well, certainly everybody in the neighborhood who wants to know how do all these old ward lines, lot lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| whatever they are, affect our rights and what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| It would also help any potential buyer for this piece of property that's on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| to know what they can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| And quite frankly, I think it would help all of you and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| because you wouldn't see this issue coming before you again the next time one of these pieces of property came up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:31| Just today a wise man told me a neighborhood is not just a place, it's a state of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| And what we're asking for is some peace of mind for our state of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| And I'd appreciate it if you would support this moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| not to stretch it out forever to get the zoning changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| but just so we all know, everybody involved, what the rules are, what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7081)|
| 1:58:09| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allentown Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| Greg has pointed out that the situation has been full of examples of bad communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| And that's certainly true and it's unfortunate because I think it's made a complicated situation even more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| and difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| But what is not complicated is the fact that a large number of my neighbors are very concerned about the pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| that infill development might take in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| And I'd like everybody who's here tonight with that concern to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:48| We're not here to object to the idea of infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| None of us would have any problem with infill along vacant street-facing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| We're not necessarily opposed to infill on these non-street-facing lots between Spence Place and the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| but we are concerned about what form that development might take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| And let's just take a minute and review the history of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| As I understand it, those lots are the lots from the original subdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| They're almost 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| And they were originally set out along what was supposed to be a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| so that access to those lots would be along another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| A council previous to this one about 10 years ago closed that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| and that right-of-way then reverted to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| And I think a lot of us understood at that time that that also meant they lost their access to those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| because those lots became then non-street-fronting lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| And frankly, that was quite a little economic boon to all those property owners when that right-of-way was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| So now that some of these property owners are coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| and they're wanting to develop on those lots that no longer have the possibility of street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| by doing some other kind of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| and we're worried that that could take a form that's not in keeping with our established neighborhood form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:18| and that that could harm the neighborhood that every one of us really love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| If we were in a situation where each of these property owners had consolidated all their lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| then if they wanted to develop, they would have to go to MPC and go through the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| That would allow MPC review and that would also allow public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| And I think everybody here would be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Nobody here is trying to stop all development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| But if the owners develop on these existing non-street-fronting lots, there's no MPC review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| there's no opportunity for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| Unfortunately, right now, and as I think Mr. Donaldson indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| there's really no clear course of action for addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| I know that Councilman Hulk was met with representatives from city departments and MPC last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| I understand they explored various options without identifying anything that would really work in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| But it's not at all clear that there's been a real organized attempt to look at and research all the possible options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:21| And as Councilman Woodhull pointed out a minute ago, nobody has really been given ownership of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:31| It's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| There's going to be additional interest in infill in our neighborhood and other south Nassau neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| because of the south waterfront development effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| And I think it's in everybody's interest to try to address these things now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| because they're going to continue to come up, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| I think we all understand that Council is probably not the best place to be trying to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| but we're sort of stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| We need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| And so we're here to ask you to help us find some reasonable way to address a difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| And that's why we're requesting an extension on the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| But more especially, we're asking that you request MPC to take charge of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| to identify and research all the options, and report back to you and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| Thanks a lot for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7345)|

| 2:02:34| Gary Anderson, 2026 Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| I live on the boulevard with my wife, Paulette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| And apparently I haven't had my ear close enough to the ground because I only recently learned of the proposed sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:50| at 2015 Spence Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| And I would like to preface my remarks by telling you that I grew up in an island home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| I would like to my mother still lives, has her home on Spence Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| And after moving away, my wife and I moved away, and being away for 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| we returned to live in an island home four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| And this neighborhood is the only neighborhood that we even considered when we decided that we would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| In the fast-changing world that we live in today, it was comforting to find a place that didn't seem to ever change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:34| My parents told me of the times they rolled me in a stroller for my grandmothers out to see the airplanes at Island Home Airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| My dad confessed that as a boy, he and his friends once greased the streetcar tracks in front of Island Home Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| in order to do a Halloween prank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| I hope the statute of limitations is out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| I think he's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| I am sure that such stories as these can be repeated by many families in Island Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| and weave a rich tapestry of life in Knoxville as it once was and still is in a dwindling few neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:10| Island Home was a good place to grow up, and the warm memories are still with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| As newcomers, whenever we met someone, they would usually ask us where we lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| and when we would reply, Island Home, the response was always something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| that's my favorite neighborhood in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| And the area seems to be popular with many who don't live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| as we see many come to enjoy the idyllic river views from our little park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| We see the mayor on his runs coming through the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| and we have the marathon come through every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:49| Knoxville seems to be proud of its neighborhood, and they like to show it off, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| With this background, and my love for Island Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| it is still difficult to speak in opposition to a property owner who wishes to develop his own land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| The owner of this property, or the potential new owner, certainly have property rights that we all hold dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| However, we also have restrictions to property owners that might adversely affect neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| A case in point might be the Legacy Mountain development that we read so much about up in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:25| When I saw the confusing map published in the New Sentinel recently, it made my head hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| I was surprised that the property lines along the river were so jumbled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| We need help from the city of Knoxville to straighten out the apparent mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| Since there are several properties along Spence that could be developed in a similar fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| I can see in the future numerous roads leading up from the river to Spence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:51| A permanent solution is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| If development takes place, it needs to be done in a manner that will be in keeping with the character of Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| What will happen to the greenway that is supposed to go down Spence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| We need more time to consider these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| We need the NPC to solve these issues and offer a plan that would be beneficial to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| and neighborhood and fair to the property owners along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| Also, please realize that the South Knoxville Waterfront Project can be a driving force for change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| outside the boundaries of the development zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| Property values will go up and economic pressure will force the changes that might be good for those seeking financial gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| and unwanted changes to those who like it the way things are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| We are facing this somewhat now in Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| As you can see from the nice poster that we have shown of the various homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| Island Home is indeed an island of timelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| Once change begins, where and when will it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Now those speaking against, first will be Mike Powell, then Robert Halls, and then Carol Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:15| Mr. Mayor, Mr. Kaiser, ladies and gentlemen on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| my name is Mike Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| My office address is 111 Fox Road, Suite 102 in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| I am here tonight on behalf of Cotter Sokola, the owner of the property at 2015 Spence Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:37| and it is Mr. Sokola who has already been damaged by the present 14-day moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:48| Prior to the issuance of that moratorium, he had a contract in place on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:55| and when the moratorium was put into effect, the buyer, the potential buyer, walked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| He now is facing a situation where if he is able to sell the property in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| it likely will not be at the price of the original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| It instead will be the sale of a piece of property that has been the subject of controversy in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:30| What I would like to address this body concerning is that area with which I am most familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:38| and that is what the law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| Mr. Kaiser and some of the other members of this body may be familiar with the case recently decided by our Tennessee Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:58| in February of this year concerning the case of Harding Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| versus the metropolitan government of Nashville and Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| And in that case, the court struck down the rescission of some demolition permits by Harding Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:18| The rescission occurred because a council member had placed on the MPC docket a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:27| to consider changing the zoning of the property that was to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| In this case, what is being asked is that the government of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:44| stop a resident of the city of Knoxville from using those rights he presently has in that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:57| and there isn't even a proposal to change the zoning of this property in place at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:10| Not even a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| And if the Supreme Court of our state would not allow the rescission of these demolition permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:23| when there had at least been a proposal made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| then how could it approve this moratorium when there has not even been a proposal made to change the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:40| Ladies and gentlemen, what you are doing if you approve this moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| is taking at least a portion of the value of Mr. Sokola's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:55| That under our Constitution you may not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| Thank you. Robert Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:12| My name is Robert Halls. I know many of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| I'm a retired member of the Knoxville Bar after 43 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| I live at 2011 Spence Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| I've lived in the Island Home area all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I live right next door to Mr. Sokola who is going to put the roadway in to allow a house to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:33| I've heard all about this, worried about the build and wash, old lot lines, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| There is a house being built on the other end of the Spence Place area that belongs to the Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:47| That house is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| It's an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| No one's been harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Everything has been made better by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| As for the land back here in the back, it's nothing but vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| You have to mow it. You have to keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| As for running the neighborhood down, no, there is no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| The main thing I want to emphasize to this group tonight is there is a thing called property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:15| We have a right to use our land as legally allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| There is no law that says Mr. Sokola cannot divide the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| They speak of these different lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| A surveyor run off Mr. Sokola's lot completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| He runs right down the side of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| The pen he put down at the side of my pen was right at the side of it, right on the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| The thing that disturbs me about this whole thing is two weeks ago tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| I was in my easy chair in my front room, and I turned on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Suddenly, there was this moratorium brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| Out of the blue, no warning, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| No one was told one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| Then on down the line, I heard a gentleman who I think you know his identity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| say that he would be responsible for notifying all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:14| To this day, I have not received any notice at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| The notice I got was sitting there on the couch watching all that take place out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| I don't think that's the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| As far as this gentleman saying he has grown up in Island Home, I have too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| I haven't lived right on the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| I haven't lived right on Spence Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| But I've been in that area for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| They have not shown any way they will be harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| The people that are doing all the calling are the ones from over on the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| two blocks away, block and a half, two blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| They're not affected by it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| They can't even see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Now, one of them lives there, and he has a nice track of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| You're not going to block his use of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| You're not going to block his view of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| You're going to let him use the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| That is his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| He worked for it and paid for it just like I worked and paid for mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| And just like Mr. Sakala, it's paid for his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| I can't see, folks, why you should allow any small group or people that are all upset over nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:19| to come in to you and say, oh, no, we want a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| Now, who is harmed by the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| I have a chimney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| It's the back of my house to a fireplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| And so we got into it and damaged the wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| I bought the wood, thinking about repairing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| I was going to paint the house, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| Suddenly, I called about a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| I was told, hey, you don't get a permit on Spence Place, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| You're out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| You've got a moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| You can't get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| So someone has been harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| And I served this to Mr. Bailey in person today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I showed him everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| So who isn't harmed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| I'm harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| What happens if the roof blows off our house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| Can we put it back on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Do we just have to sit there with an umbrella?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| No, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| As far as being a favored neighborhood and a loving neighborhood, yes, it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| Folks, it will stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| It's not going to get that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| With what the islands put down there, if they just keep it up, it will be a better neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| We won't be hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| We'll be in fine shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| Thirty more seconds, Mr. Hoss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I would ask members of city council, especially those that know me, to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:38| I've been an island home ever since you've known me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| And think twice before you take our rights away from us to our property that we have worked so hard for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| If anyone should object to Sokolos dividing it up, running the road, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| I'm right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| I would ask you to consider this when you make your final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| And remember, they're not people on Smith's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| There's only about six that touch the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| These folks are from around about two or three blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| They're not having to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Carol Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Rob, did you have something now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Carol Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Carol Allen, 2129 Smith's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| I'm here tonight as one of the property owners in the moratorium area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| I want to express my appreciation to council for your vote at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| so the affected property owners included in this moratorium boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| excuse me, would have opportunity to comment on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| In the last week, I've contacted all of you by phone and email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| For the sake of brevity tonight, I want to highlight a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| There are 11 property owners in the moratorium area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| Six of those property owners have potential buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| The others of us do not have the ability to do what is being stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| by this building permit moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Doug and I believe that the property owners' personal property rights should be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| These properties are in an R1 zone, and if proper access to lots is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| they should be able to build within the guidelines of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| just as we were able to do in 1997 going through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| The present moratorium encompasses all building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| and is restricting the basic maintenance of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| That fact seems to be more far-reaching than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| Please vote against this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| and end the building permit moratorium on these properties tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Ms. Craig or whoever is going to speak from the floor side has two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| I won't need that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| I just want to address a couple of points that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| One is I think everyone here would agree that the Allens house is an asset to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| but you just heard Ms. Allens say they resubdivided their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| and went through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| If that were happening with these other properties, none of us would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| And also the Allens were building to live in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| and making a personal investment not just in terms of money but in terms of their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| and we all appreciate them very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| As far as people who don't live on Spence Place having an interest in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| I would submit to you that everybody in our neighborhood is affected by everything that happens in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| and obviously there's a lot of people who care very deeply or we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:23| And, again, I want to stress that while we would very much like to see a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| we are especially asking to get some clear resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| and clarification of everything that's involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| And so what we really want to stress is we want you to give somebody ownership of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| and we think MPC is the right party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| If you think somebody else is, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| But put somebody in charge of doing a job of really looking at all the alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| researching them, and, you know, putting together some kind of report that we can all look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| and we can all say, okay, we're all looking at stuff on the same page now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| This is a question actually for Ms. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Do you mind, Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| I guess I'm still back to sort of what's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| And I know you and I have had these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| so I want sort of your sense on what could go wrong here that you all want to prevent, and simple language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| Well, I'm not sure that all 27 or how many people are here tonight have exactly the same idea I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:33| But my big concern about this, and quite frankly, if the right-of-way had never been closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:38| and we could build another street down along the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| and houses were built on these lots facing that street like the subdivision was originally planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| I wouldn't be here because that's consistent with the form of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| We'd just be adding another street to the neighborhood grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| And frankly, although it's nice to have all that open space, it's beautiful, it's beautiful from the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| and I'd prefer to keep it, I wouldn't have any objection if we were under that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| But we're in a circumstance now where we have all these lots that don't have street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| And in order to get access, they're going to have to have joint permanent easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| And, you know, in the Sacala's case, I guess we're talking about one joint permanent easement to a couple of houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| which is essentially a private cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| But if other property owners chose to develop in the same way, we could end up with a series of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| And an old neighborhood built on a grid pattern is not going to be helped very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| by having a series of cul-de-sacs plopped down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| And I think that is really what bothers me, is that we're going to mess with the form of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| which I think would be detrimental to the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| So, you know, that's, I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| That's my biggest fear, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| I have a question, a specific question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| You heard Mr. Powell, as attorney for Mr. Sacala, talk about this council's ability to or not to grant moratoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:11| Do you care to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Well, without responding to everything he said, I have read the Harding Place opinion actually a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:24| and am very familiar with that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| It really deals with the issue of an attempt to rescind demolition permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| It doesn't deal with moratoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| There is specific case law out there that authorizes local government legislatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:40| to enact temporary stopgap moratoria for the purpose of accomplishing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:49| And so that authority, as far as I know, continues to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:55| and the Harding Place decision does not in any way change that law to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| I think Ms. Allen had something she wanted to say, but I'd just like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| Well, I think I need to clarify two points since they've been stated about our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| First of all, the closures of the roadways were in 1989 by Mr. Kaplan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| and in 1997 by us on behalf of all the remaining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| So that's something that continues to be misstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| The second thing is we did not split lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| We bought four and a half lots in one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| We combined it through MPC, through what they call a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| but in our case was a consolidation, making one lot, which is where our house is built now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| and the one lot that remains with 2125 where the Risbergs live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| A question for, I guess this is Rachel Craig again, and then some other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| and I wish I thought of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| Is your fear is creating little cul-de-sacs anywhere in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| And as I look at this, I actually see just on the map we've got some place behind Maple Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| where we sort of got the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| Actually, I just noticed that on the map when I was sitting out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| Yeah, that would be my fear, anywhere in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| Anywhere in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| The only non-street-fronting vacant lots that I was really aware of were the ones on Spence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| but, yes, it would be a fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| So would you support extending the moratorium to the whole of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| If that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| That's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| I really, again, I want to stress the moratorium is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| but we really, really, really want somebody to address the whole thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| Let me ask a couple quick questions, I guess, of Mr. Donaldson about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| One is one of the issues that's been talked about sort of is the lot line map thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| And just to be clear, do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| I mean, would we sit back if we had the time and fix all these lot lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| Is that something that MPC does or the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| MPC does not have the authority to make an application for a subdivision on behalf of owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| nor does the city, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| So the lot line stuff individuals have to fix, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| Let me ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| Is there anything Ms. Craig was asking about sort of a solution to the cul-de-sac idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| this idea of the roads just shooting off, which I think is a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| What solutions do you have for dealing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| I mean, what could be done to limit that if we wanted to, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:49| Well, the use of joint permanent easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| and other permanent easements to provide access to lots that don't otherwise have frontage on public streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| are used throughout the county in many, many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| A joint permanent easement quite often has the appearance of a driveway rather than a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| It certainly doesn't have the standards that are required for a public road that would be a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:20| much less obtrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| And the fact that it appears that if a joint permanent easement were used on any of the deeded properties there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:36| it would probably be providing access only to up to two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| So to classify that in the same category as a public cul-de-sac is probably not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:53| But as far as something that could, I mean, you and I talked about a subdivision regulation change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| that could actually say nobody anywhere could use a joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| Are there other solutions you're thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| I'm certainly not going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| You know, there are always exceptions to rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| and I live in a subdivision that's by and large a totally connected street system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:21| but we do have cul-de-sacs when the conditions warrant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| And quite often it's warranted when the street system is away from the riverfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| and people have wanted to build homes along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8790)|
| 2:26:35| I can think of a place where there's a private street in our neighborhood with five or six houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:42| And final question, Ms. Craig said we want to get some help in figuring this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| Is that something that legitimately MPC could think about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| What is an answer to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| Is that within your scope of expertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| We can ask more people whether governments have the authority to plow other people's lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| and probably get the same answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| Well, I don't want to speak for how people are thinking and what the thoughts are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| but I believe Mr. Congleton, I wrote clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| I think that was the main issue that he had both two weeks ago and again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:33| And I think there was another comment that Ms. Craig made about concerns regarding the pattern of infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| that their area might take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| And, of course, there were a lot of other comments that were being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| And what it appears, I don't know what can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| but I think one element that I have seen missing in this whole discussion, which has come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:57| and I really don't think it belongs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| And that's one thing that really bothers me because I have made that comment to several people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| I've spent the day thinking about this and talking with a number of people on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:11| But I just don't think it belongs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| Because we don't have the answers as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| I don't know that there are answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| but I think there are points of clarification that are crucial to be able to satisfy everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| and a number of people have come out on both sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| and particularly people with questions about how this is going to affect their property and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| I don't know if a moratorium being continued is the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:42| One thing that concerns me greatly, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d1?start=8922)|
