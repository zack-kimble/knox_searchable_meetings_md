|   78    |   83.48 | Lundy for tonight's devotional. Thank you so much. Before I start, I want to do a                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=78.0)               |
|   83.48 |   88.36 | moment of silence. We lost a great leader last week, former Commissioner Thomas                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=83.48)              |
|   88.36 |   94.36 | Strickland, better known as Tank. He was the first Democratic chair and black                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=88.36)              |
|   94.36 |  100.92 | person to share the County Commission, so that just shows how much, it was a                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=94.36)              |
|  100.92 |  105.84 | Republican majority, but it shows how much people respected him as a person                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=100.92)             |
|  105.84 |  109.6  | and he will be greatly missed in our community and in Knox County, so we can                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=105.84)             |
|  109.6  |  113.04 | just bow our heads for a second.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=109.60000000000001) |
|  120.2  |  126.24 | Thank you so much. So as I was thinking about Tank and talking to a former                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=120.2)              |
|  126.24 |  131.6  | people that's been in office, such as State Representative Joe Armstrong and                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=126.24000000000001) |
|  131.6  |  135.56 | former Representative Rick Staples, just everybody's telling me how great                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=131.6)              |
|  135.56 |  143.44 | of a man he was. And I also talked to former Mayor Rasdell and Commissioner                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=135.56)             |
|  143.44 |  149.36 | Mike Arms, and they was telling me all the stories of how politics was when                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=143.44)             |
|  149.36 |  153.88 | they was in office, and it seemed like it was so much more unity than it is now                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=149.36)             |
|  153.88 |  160.48 | when we look at what's going on in the nation and where we are, and I                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=153.88)             |
|  160.48 |  163.88 | was kind of jealous. I'm like, man, it seems like, you know, it was more of like a                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=160.48000000000002) |
|  164    |  169.08 | team. So what I was thinking of, I've been reading a book called Disruptive                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=164.0)              |
|  169.08 |  175.48 | Thinking. It's by T.D. Jase. He's a mega pastor out of Texas, and                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=169.07999999999998) |
|  175.48 |  180.76 | what's on my heart right now is just so much division that's happening                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=175.48)             |
|  180.76 |  185.92 | within us, within our communities, and it's like we can't find common                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=180.76)             |
|  185.92 |  190.88 | ground, and I hope that we can disrupt our thinking by really just remembering                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=185.92)             |
|  190.88 |  194.84 | the Great Commission that we are called to do, whether or not you believe in                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=190.88)             |
|  194.84 |  199.96 | Christianity or not. When you look at different world scriptures, everything                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=194.84)             |
|  199.96 |  204.6  | is based and rooted in love, and I pray that we can get to the space that we can                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=199.96)             |
|  204.6  |  209.44 | love our God, whoever your God is, and love yourself and heal yourself,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=204.6)              |
|  209.84 |  216.8  | however that looks for you, and be bold enough to love others and including                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=209.84)             |
|  216.8  |  221.8  | your enemies also. So I just really wanted to leave us with that. We can do                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=216.8)              |
|  221.8  |  226    | better because there's a whole nation out there. There's a whole community out                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=221.8)              |

| 3144.88 | 3150.36 | Court on the other side of the bench multiple times. I've talked to I think                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3144.88)            |
| 3150.36 | 3155.04 | all five judges at this point and it's not like this is the first time they've                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3150.36)            |
| 3155.04 | 3158.16 | seen these two candidates they've they've seen them multiple times one of                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3155.04)            |
| 3158.16 | 3163.24 | them are substitutes on a regular basis and the other one's been trained to be a                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3158.1600000000003) |
| 3163.24 | 3168.44 | substitute so I I don't think that they are unfamiliar with these candidates I                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3163.2400000000002) |
| 3168.44 | 3171.92 | think they wouldn't present us with a candidate that they're not familiar with                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3168.44)            |
| 3171.92 | 3178.08 | and that they decide not to go through a whatever process they decide is what                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3171.92)            |
| 3178.08 | 3182.32 | they decide. I believe in Commissioner Jay's point that anybody in the county                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3178.08)            |
| 3182.32 | 3186    | could have came forward last week and we would have had a talk with them then                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3182.3199999999997) |
| 3186    | 3189.44 | they would have gone back to the judges and the judges at that point could                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3186.0)             |
| 3189.44 | 3193.24 | interview them again or talk to them or not talk to them it's it's their choice                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3189.44)            |
| 3193.24 | 3198.68 | at that point but just because this leg is over with doesn't mean that the                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=3193.24)            |
