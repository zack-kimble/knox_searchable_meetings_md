| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| For those of you who haven't been to any public meeting, my name is Krista Kugrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| I'm an attorney for the city of Knoxville, and I worked with other city staff members to help draft the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| So thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| We know that this is an exciting opportunity for a lot of you, and we've sort of been waiting a long time to sort of get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=44)|
| 0:00:52| So we're excited to be able to do the permits at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| and we wanted to offer this training so we can walk through the permit application with you and answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=55)|
| 0:01:04| I'll let the other city staff members who are here introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| Jesse Mayshaw, director of communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| We've been trying to communicate a lot about this and what it means and how it works and everything, so thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| And I'm Donna Dyer, the revenue administrator for the city, so I oversee the business tax office, which is the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=80)|
| 0:01:30| I'm Debbie Sharp with the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| I'm the assistant neighborhood coordinator, and part of the ordinance was to notify either your neighborhood organization, if there is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=92)|
| 0:01:41| and the surrounding houses, so I'll help you figure out what that would mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| So I've got a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| It's going to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| I don't have copies for you to follow along, but hopefully you did put your email address on the sign-up sheet, and I can email it out afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=112)|
| 0:01:59| There are some hyperlinks in the PowerPoint presentation that will be useful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| The other documents that were at the door, there was the application itself, which is available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| It also has hyperlinks in it and a FAQs document, which should answer most of your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| but again, I realize there's circumstances that come up and particular situations, and we can work through some of those questions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| So I'm going to walk through everything with the PowerPoint, and then we'll get to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| If you have a burning question during the PowerPoint presentation, feel free to raise your hand, but there will be an opportunity at the end for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| So with that, we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Just a little bit of an overview of what we're going to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| The permitting process and the permit types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| How to find the information required for permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| The other required information that you may need along the way or after you get your application filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| How to fill out the neighborhood notice form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| How to pay taxes to the city and the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| And enforcement and violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| Okay, so a permit is required for operation of any short-term rental unit in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Operation without that permit is illegal, and that was part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| Come on in. We just got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| There's a sign-up sheet, if you wouldn't mind to put your email address and name on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| There's some additional documents that you may want to grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| So a permit is required. Operation without a permit is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| And that's by effect of a city ordinance that became effective on January 2nd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| The ordinance is posted online. It actually has two components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| There was the first portion and then a later amendment that added the neighborhood notice that Debbie mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| The cost varies based on the type of permit, and we're going to talk about those permit types on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| The Type 1 permit is $70. The Type 2 and Type 3 permits are $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| And annual renewals, if allowed, will be $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| And if you're wondering, that noise is the elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| It sort of sounds like a bowling alley or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| We don't have a bowling alley in this building, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| It's just the elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| So the reason it said annual renewals, if allowed, will be $50 is that the Type 3 permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| which are sort of a special limited-time permit, are not renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| But the Type 1 and Type 2 are renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| A business license is required from both the city and the county prior to submitting your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| The cost is $15 per jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| Can you say that again? The Type 1 permit is not renewable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| The Type 3 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| And I'm going to talk about the permit types on the next slide and talk a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| As far as the business licenses, those are $15 per jurisdiction, so that's a total of $30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| which rounds out your cost at $100 or $150, depending on the permit type that you'll be applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Permits will be issued through the Business License and Tax Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| which is on the fourth floor of this building, basically right over here, one floor below us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| So you get off the elevator, hang a left, and it's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| One thing I do want to note is that private agreements are not within the scope of the city's authority for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| So if you have some sort of HOA, condo association, that has rules that govern your use of your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| that is a dispute between you and your HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| We will not get involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| We are regulating this from the government's perspective, not from the private perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| So I just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| As for the permit types, we've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Type 1 permit is for owner-occupied units in residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| So owner-occupied, that sort of is the big emphasis there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| You have to own the unit, and you have to occupy it, as in live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| And so these are available only to natural persons, because a corporation really can't live in a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| And so a natural person who owns and lives in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| The criteria for determining residency and ownership is laid out in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| We'll be looking at the deed to determine ownership, and that has to be a recorded deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and specific governmental documents, which are the owner's motor vehicle registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| a valid driver's license or Tennessee identification card, proof of owner's children's school registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| the owner's voter registration card, or the owner's W-2 mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| And so we're going to be looking for two of those documents, again, to demonstrate that you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Those are, once you submit those to the city, they become public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| So for your W-2, for example, you'll want to cross through your social security number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| anything that you don't want to become a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Obviously, your address is essential to determining that you reside at the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| but other than that, there may be information that you want to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| This permit, the Type 1 permit, is available in all residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and we'll talk a little bit later about how to find your zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| But that's the Type 1 permit, and I think that will be the majority of the permits that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and those all are renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| The Type 2 permit is intended for non-owner-occupied and non-residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Now, if you occupy a unit in a non-residentially zoned district, you can still get this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| but this is really intended for folks who may have a primary residence in a residential district out west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| and so they live there, and then they have some sort of condo downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| but they want to make some profit off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Downtown is zoned commercial, C2, and so that would be a non-residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| So those are available to the owner of the property or a lessee or agent with the owner's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=493)|
| 0:08:23| It's not allowed necessarily in all non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| It's only allowed in non-residential districts that allow residences or dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So we have some industrial districts, for example, people aren't allowed to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| so you can't get a permit in an industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| There's a limit of two Type 2 permits per permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| So if you are applying as John Smith LLC, you can get two permits as John Smith LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=525)|
| 0:08:57| The Type 3 permit is the special one that was added toward the end of the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| as it was going through city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| These are for non-owner-occupied units in residential design districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| So this permit is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| This is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| It's only available until February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| So if this applies to you, you have to come and get it before February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| After that, we are not accepting any applications for these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| It is also available only to operators who operated their short-term rental unit prior to March 1st of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| So you'll have to provide some documentation to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| So those are two sort of parameters on that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| And this permit is valid until January 2nd, 2019, and it is non-renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| So the idea behind this permit is city council wanted to allow folks who have been operating these unregulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| to have a little bit of time to sort of wind down operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| So this is what they came up with as the concept, a limited Type 3 permit that is only good for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| And of course, during that year, it can be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| We're going to talk about that toward the end of the PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| But those are the types of permits that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| For finding your zoning district, how many of you have never used KGIS, Knoxville Geographic Information System?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| All right, so it looks like there's several people, so we're going to talk about that really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Yeah, it is very user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| It's just a super handy tool to know about because it provides a wealth of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Okay, so what you'll do is you'll go to KGIS.org to its maps function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| So just Google KGIS maps and it will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| This is what it will take you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| And so let's look at someone specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Five, two, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Fountainhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| One word or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I just need the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| So what I did here is at the top there's a search function per address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| So I put in your address and it comes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Five, two, six, seven, Fountainhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Smithwood Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That's an old map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| So let's just zoom in and see what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| So can you see the screen up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Does this look like the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| So this is a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Like the city limits are mapped onto this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| There's a whole lot that's actually mapped onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And so I'm zooming out a little bit so you can sort of see where we are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| So kind of out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Are you in the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| We're in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| So the county has not yet passed an ordinance to regulate short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| And so you at this point...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Can we still get zoning, find out what zoning is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| We have filled out our paperwork just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| So what I did just now was I went to the maps tab at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| And there's a bunch of options here as to what you can look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| And so what we're going to go to is the planning and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| There's a drop-down menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| I just click this little arrow here and it drops down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| And then we look at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| So then it brings up this lovely color-coded map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| And this property is in RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| So the county has, much like the city, has zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| And off the top of my head, I don't know what RA stands for under the county zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| But I assume it's some sort of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Typically, when you see R, it means residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I can do my house if you want a house inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| We'll look at yours next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| So you can see sort of the designations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| So let's hop over to yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| If you want to find out what RA is, you would contact the county then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| So they're going to contact Knox County to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| It's also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| It's also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| It will say what RA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| 2443 Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| B-U-F-F-E-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Buffett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| So, and we've already got the zoning filter pulled up, so it shows us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=842)|
| 0:14:13| Your property is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| And so if you want to find out other information about the property, you can click this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| tool at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| You can look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Are you Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| And there's some other information on here I will not pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| But it's a super handy tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| You can find out a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| You can find out how much you paid, how much, like if it's in arrears for taxes, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| We won't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| But these designations indicate how you can use property in the city of Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| will dictate what type of permit you're eligible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| So, for example, over here, this is a commercial district, C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| It's our neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| You'll see sometimes what these flashes mean with the designation afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| That is an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| That is the infill housing overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So if you see that, you can just notate that on your application along with the zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| says C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Also notate the overlay district if you see something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Just put down the letters that you see, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| I just printed out the map to get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| So let's hop back over to the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| So this explains what I just told you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| So if you're looking at this later, I should walk you through the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| If you are an entity applying for a permit, do we have anyone in here who's applying as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| a corporation or LLC, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Then I won't go over this just to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| For those folks that are doing it, that way they have to show that they're an entity in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| So that's just what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Safety and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| There are safety requirements that you have to verify to the city of Knoxville as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| of your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| So if you have the application in front of you, flip to page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| The page numbers are at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=988)|
| 0:16:39| So the equipment that you'll be verifying that exists and is in working order in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| unit, there is a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide alarm, and fire extinguisher requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Carbon monoxide, if there's no gas in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| That question has come up, and I asked the fire marshal about it, and he said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| And at the time...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Is it for the fireplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| What are they going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| It's an attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I'm glad that you guys remembered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| So that's what it has to do with, is kind of the attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| We don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of whether you have an attached garage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| trying to kind of figure that out, so we just have a requirement off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| So the verification form spells out a little bit more of where these need to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| Outside the bedrooms, you'll see the details in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And so you'll just have to put down, here are the number of smoke alarms I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Here's where they're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| That's what this form is provided for, and then you're signing to say that this is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| and that the equipment's in working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| You also said extinguishers, but they didn't specify how many or where they have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| So there has to be at least one operable fire extinguisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| You may wish to provide more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| These are minimums, so feel free to provide more if you want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| So it says even those areas or rooms that are not available for occupancy is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| the short-term dimensional unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| So in the other part that I occupy, I need to say where those are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| And then another question that we get frequently is whether we require insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| The city is not reviewing insurance as your homeowner's insurance as part of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| process, but I do just want to throw out there that you probably ought to check with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| homeowner's insurance provider because if they deem that you are engaging in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| activity, it could change your coverage, whether you're covered or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| And so that's really important for you to just check on as a general matter for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| you and your occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| So this is the following two pages in the application packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| There are two forms for the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| One is sort of a general overview where you provide summary information about your short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| And then the following page, page six, is where you give us a drawing of your floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| How accurate is the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Well, you are, when you submit the application, you are verifying that it's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| As far as precision, we just want it to be, show the layout of the house, the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| That's very essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Very general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| And because there's a maximum occupancy based on the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| So that's a really important component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| We also want you to show where you're going to be providing parking for your guests because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| that's been a large concern as we've gone throughout this process from neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| So those are the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| But, you know, it does need to be accurate as far as representing the layout of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| house and your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| But there is not a requirement that you have off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| You just have to show, you know, if you don't, there are some houses that don't even have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| So if you're going to tell people to park on the street, just show where you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| to tell people to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| For some of the older neighborhoods, if that's the scenario, just make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Neighborhood notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So this is something that Debbie mentioned at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| So for Type 1 and 3 permits, those that are in residential districts, the applicant must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| send notice of their activity to adjacent and nearby neighbors and the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| So that is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| The form that you'll use is provided on the last page of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| What is considered adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| So that is defined in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| But we provided a kind of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| The setbacks are specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| It's 325 feet away is the first house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| So you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| So I was asking what the rule is here and if you adopt the same rule there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| So we've defined adjacent essentially to capture the shaded boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So behind you, next to you, across the street, diagonal across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Those are the folks that you have to notify using this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And so what we've done in order to make this really clear at the outset for both us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| you is we want you to provide a standard map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| And I'm going to show you what that looks like and show you how to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| I'm sorry the screen keeps going black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| I have to choose this duplication thing each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Super inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| So here's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| And let me zoom in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And then I'll show you how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| It will be using KGIS as we did just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| The same map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| The same map that you use for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| You get the same map for your zoning, you can use that same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| This is the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Let's say, for example, your short-term rental was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| We want you to bring in a map that shows, marked, who you'll be sending the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| notification form to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| And this just gives us that knowledge on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Otherwise, you would have to come back and resubmit to us who you sent it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| This just makes it a little easier for you and us on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| You can find these folks' addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| You send it to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| You can find the property owner's address by using that little information tool that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| I showed you on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| It pops up, shows you the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Does there have to be a residence there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Like, if there's a lot, do you have to send it to the owner of the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It says property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So regardless of whether there's a building there or, you know, the idea is just so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| people around you know what's happening at your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Does this include commercial, like, apartments that are across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| And typically, if it's an apartment building, there's going to be one owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| If it's a condo building, then there may be individual owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Let us know if that comes up, because it would be rather inconvenient to send this to 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| That's something that came up during the drafting process, and we may need to tweak the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| But if it's an apartment building, it's probably owned by one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| And if it's a condo building, maybe you're downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| And if you're downtown, you're a Type 2 permit, and you don't have to send this notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| So it's kind of all these pieces sort of fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| We don't pay into an association, and it's just a voluntary group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| You're still part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| You still have to send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Just out of courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Is there a way to figure out if we have a neighborhood group if we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| We're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| So why is the Harrington Apartments not crossed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So they are not really diagonal across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| But I think it's sort of up for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| But the diagonal one across the street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| So reasonable lines can differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| So that's sort of why we want this provided on the front end with your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| So that someone at business tax can say, hey, look at your map and say, to err on the side of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| why don't you notify this lady that we're moving it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| So let's hop back over to the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Do we have to send this exact notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Like photocopy the sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| And so I think what you all have been doing is like you would fill this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| and then we'll make copies of it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| If you fill it out, then we can print copies for you while you're in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| After we've reviewed the map to see who you need to send it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So that's super handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Makes it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Finding your neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| So here's the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| On KGIS maps, and I'm not going to walk through the steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| because we've already seen where KGIS maps is and how it functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| so this is very, very similar to the steps that we just walked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| You'll just choose a different drop-down menu and a different button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And Debbie did print out instructions as well, so she'll pass those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| But you can see here, so I chose the Emporium Lost downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| You can see that they're shaded in the green there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| and the neighborhood group kind of is in bold there at the corner of Jackson and Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| It says downtown in bold italic text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So that is the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| And then to contact the neighborhood group, there's a couple ways that you can go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I found KGIS can be a little finicky for me, but that's totally operator here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| I think the Office of Neighborhoods does have a directory of neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| So you can go to this hyperlink here, where their directory is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| and it's got the contact information for all of the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| And if you have questions about your neighborhood group, you can go and talk to Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Her phone number is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Her office is on this floor just down the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| So if you have questions about that, we'll move on to maybe one of the most important topics, taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| Okay, so everyone who has a permit has to pay the hotel occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| Sometimes it's called the hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Sometimes it's just called the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I put both terms up here to make it super identifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Under state law, I think it's called the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| That is due to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| The rate is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| That money goes towards paying off the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| The city is negotiating an agreement with Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| so that Airbnb would collect and remit those taxes to the city of Knoxville on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| But we have not yet finalized that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| How many of you use platforms other than Airbnb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Do any of you cross list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Wow, easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Yeah, so I think then paying those taxes will be rather simple for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1701)|
| 0:28:29| Once we get that agreement sorted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Do you have any idea of time frame when that might happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| I'm hoping to hear from them in the next couple days as far as a final agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| and then as far as signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| That takes a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| In the interim, you are responsible for this tax and the other taxes that I'm going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| How you choose to collect and remit that is where you find that money essentially is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| But it is due legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| And Donna can talk a little bit more about these taxes after I go through this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| because she's really the expert on taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Airbnb will not be collecting any taxes until you all come to an agreement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Sales tax is collected by the state of Tennessee and that rate is set by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| Gross receipts tax is collected also by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| but tracked using the local business license that you're going to be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| And that tax rate is also set by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| So Donna, do you want to talk a little bit more about these taxes and how folks would go about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| I don't know how deep you really want me to get into it because the occupancy tax is the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| The sales tax is remitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| You will register online with the state of Tennessee for your sales tax license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| and they will detail to you when that is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| It's based off of your sales as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I mean that's a tax that you should be collecting on the front end and remitting to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| It's really not your tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| You're collecting it from your renter and then just forwarding it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Same thing as the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| The gross receipts tax is a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| It is a very small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| It's a fraction of a percentage on your physical gross receipts, not your net, but your gross for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| If you're grossing less than $10,000 a year, then you will apply for a minimal activity license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| which means you really won't pay a gross receipts tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| You'll only pay $15 a year to renew that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| because your tax will be less than $15 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| If you're grossing millions of dollars, you will pay some tax, but it's not a huge tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| Are there any questions? I want to dig deep when you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| On the hotel tax, if they're over 30 days, do we have to pay the tax for those guests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| You want to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| If you're over 30 days, then this doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| There may be a circumstance, and this question has come up already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| where you rent sometimes for three or four days at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| but then you have somebody who wants to come and stay here for three months as a sabbatical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| The occupancy tax is not due on anything that's over 30 days under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Under 30 or over 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| If the stay is over 30 days, occupancy tax is not due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| The reporting form, which is not online yet, but will be shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| will have you list your gross, and then it has you back out any stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| For a normal hotel-motel occupancy tax, a reporting form has them list their full gross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| and then you back out any stays over 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I really don't even have that form finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| but probably that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| But typically, this permit is not for stays more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Right. But if you're doing both, if you sort of go back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| In one reporting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| She had a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Hotel and sales tax, those are due monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I thought I said online quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| The hotel tax typically is due as a monthly reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| We are discussing, and we'll probably allow quarterly reporting only because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| this type of business you're not necessarily renting every week or every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| It is a required reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| You have to report even a zero form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| If the requirement is that you remit every month, and you didn't rent this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| there's no way for me to know that you just didn't fail to pay it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| unless you remit a zero form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| So, in order to keep, we have discussed doing quarterly to keep you from remitting so many zero forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| if that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| A final decision hasn't been made on that, and it will be clear on your reporting form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| whether it will be due monthly or quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Okay, so gross receipts are yearly now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| The gross receipts are yearly, and that is based on your fiscal year of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| So, the vast majority of that is the calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| but if you tell the state that your fiscal year is a different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| then they will set your reporting period at a different fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| I don't know what the sales tax is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| It depends on your type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I think it depends on when you register, but that is all clear when you register for your sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Your sales tax, sales and use tax ID, and they will tell you that reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| And those due dates will be fed to you through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| And so, there's links here for the state sites as far as registering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| And like Donna said, we don't have the form finalized because of everything sort of in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| until we get this agreement negotiated with Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| So, when that form is available, it will be on the first link, which is our local link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| And so, what she was referring to, and in case this wasn't clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| so Airbnb will send us the occupancy taxes due for your rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| That's what's contemplated to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| They will send us the taxes that are due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| but you will still have to tell us quarterly what sort of taxes were collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| kind of from your end of things, the dashboard that you're able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| And that way we've got sort of numbers to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| because Airbnb is paying the city of Knoxville in a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| They're not paying us per rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| So, along with your remittance with our reporting form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| we will ask of you a summary from your Airbnb to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So, you'll put your gross list back out, how much of that was collected through Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| and then remit your remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| You may be remitting a form with no money if all of your rentals are through Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| But unfortunately, you will still have to submit that form to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| If you've already applied or you've already gotten your permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| and I haven't given you that reporting form yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| then we will mail it to you or we'll make sure that you get that prior to it being due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| when it's finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| The ideal is once it's finalized, as you get your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| you will be provided the type of form that you're required to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and the period in which you should file it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| I have a question, Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Do we know if the state, if part of their conversation with Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| is for Airbnb to also collect sales taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Because I think they do that some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I don't know if that's part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And so, just, you know, the General Assembly is back in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| and they are probably going to be taking up short-term rentals in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| It's sort of been an ongoing discussion as far as they're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| There was some legislation proposed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| that just took a variety of forms over the course of the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| But I think we can expect to see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| We don't quite know what yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I think sales tax, Airbnb permitting that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| But I don't know if that's part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| So I just want to mention a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Rules of general applicability, these apply to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| regardless of what type of permit you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| You do not have to be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| but you do have to have a local agent who can be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| to respond within 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| And the idea being, you know, if you're renting out your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and you want to go out of town for the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| like, that's totally acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Some jurisdictions do have the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| that you be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| but we did not feel that that was quite right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| for an off sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And so you don't have to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You do have to have a local agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| There's a place on the application for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| to put that person's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| So if at any point you expect to not be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| you need to put that person's information down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| and that person will be contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| if a problem arises during a rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| The number of occupants, this is also a really important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| So the maximum is two people per bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| plus an additional two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| You know, kind of with the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| that you may have a pull-out couch in the living room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| and so two people per bedroom plus an additional two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| However, there is a maximum of 12 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| and that's per fire code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| that more than 12 people essentially changes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| into a different occupancy per the state fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And so 12 is the maximum number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| who can be in the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| regardless of whether they are renting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| So if you are there, and your spouse is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| you count towards that max 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| So in that case, you could only have 10 people in your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| provided that you had the number of bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| that added up to that number for the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Would that count if you had, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| a separate apartment from your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| If you had a separate apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| and that's permitted separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| that does not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Would that count towards children as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Two people, one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| So even infants as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Anyone who's a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Now, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I mean, there's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| But I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| You can give me an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Okay, just a couple more slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Being a good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| you know, if any of you come to the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| you know there's a lot of concern for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| about the impacts of short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| although we haven't seen a lot of impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| as far as complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| But we just want to throw this out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| that there are a few ways that you can be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| And then some of the sort of best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| are already in place with the Neighborhood Notice form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So those include letting your neighbor know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| and giving them your contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| So that's already taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| As far as additional things that you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| make sure that your guests know where to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| where to put the trash, and when to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Those are the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| That's where we expect to hear complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| So if you can address those things through house rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I think you're sort of ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| The city will be launching a 24-hour hotline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| for short-term rental complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| as part of the enforcement software that we're obtaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| We'll talk about that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| And Airbnb does have a neighbor complaint mechanism online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| And enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| So how will we deal with violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And the answer to this question depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| whether we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| permitted or unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| So I'll start with unpermitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| because that's sort of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| We have a lot of unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| We are employing a software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| and essentially what it does is it looks at an Airbnb listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| and then looks at all the other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| that's available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| So tax records, property records, KBIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| all realtor listings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| everything that's available online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| and makes a logical conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| about who owns that short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| And then that information is provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| and then we use that software to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| as far as tracking the unpermitted status of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| We're not going to be heavy-handed right out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| We realize this is a new process for us and for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| So what we anticipate doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| is sending out a series of letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| You know, oh, we see that you're unpermitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Please get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Here's how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| The second one may not be as nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Eventually, it will lead to citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| which go to city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| and then are appealable to circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| And I think the worst-case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| is some sort of injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| that the city files against an operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| So we expect to take sort of progressive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| to address bad actors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| but we suspect that most people will comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| But what if you are operating a non-owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| in a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| and you did not apply for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| I mean, this is not me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| but if someone were to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| be on there in, like, April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| they're too late to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So do they automatically get, like, a citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| They are not eligible for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So that won't be a little warning here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| It will be a warning that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| cease authorizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I mean, we'll randomly let you're not authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| you're not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| you cannot be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| so cease authorizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| And then it will escalate in the same kind of manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, the sort of friendly progression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| assumes that that person is eligible for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| If they're not eligible for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| that may look a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| But we'll give folks the benefit of the doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| that they're not supposed to be doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| or that they should be doing it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| So that's what we anticipate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| If someone does have a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| so let's say you get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| and your property is just a huge problem property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| with a lot of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| in the ordinance we provided, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| it's sort of a progressive idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| in that after a certain number of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| we'll revoke the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and then there's an appeal for the revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| if you feel that that is something that you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| There's a board of city staff who will hear the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| So that's how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Are the complaints followed up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and made sure that they're justified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| We're not just going to take anonymous calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| The ordinance does sort of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| once a complaint is found to be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So yeah, we will be investigating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| So that's it as far as the overall presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| You have the FAQ document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| which hopefully answers other questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| If you have other questions right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| if you feel like they would be beneficial for the group to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| go ahead and pitch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| If you want to talk to us one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I think we can stick around for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I really appreciate your interest in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| And if you have feedback as you go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Hang on just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| There is an email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| It's strs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| so for short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| strs at Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| tn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| and that information should be on the application form as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| But if you have questions, comments, suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| please let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| because we're new at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| but we're hoping that it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| The permit is for a type 1 $70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| for a type 2 and 3 are $120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and then you have to get the business licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| which are an additional $30 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| $70 for the permit and $30 for the licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| $10, $15 and $15 for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| Which comes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| You can do it all in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It's all on the same floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| The county business license is in the adjacent old courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| but it's still on the same premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| so you have to show your county business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| before I will release the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| You may come and apply for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and not have it finalized and complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and may release it at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| but you can apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| and we'll give you the list of things you have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and then you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| as you bring things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| or you may be very organized and have it all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| and then we'll issue the permit the moment we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Typically it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| if you're trying to do it all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| you would want to go to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| and have that in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| If you're applying for Type 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| what IDs are required if you're using the PO Box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| Like taxes for the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| You have to show that you live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| so whatever documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| I mean we've got the ones laid out in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| driver's license, vehicle registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| but they need to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| that the person who's on the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| who owns the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| also lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| We have to provide a copy of the deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| It says in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| that a copy of the deed is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| we can pull up a copy of the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| and see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| but again that's in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| and then you can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Where do I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Second floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Register of Deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| and you can go in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| and get a copy of the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| You can actually print a copy of your deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| from KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| there is a link to the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| there is an instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| it doesn't always work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| because some of those deeds are super old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| certainly if it's a newer deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| it probably will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| but some of them don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| it doesn't always work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| but there is a link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| that you can click| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| and it will bring that document up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| and you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| it's an image usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| it's not a document as you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| How many IDs do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| If you have a copy of the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| No, the copy of the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| only shows your ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| it does not prove your residency there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| so you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| copies of the IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| you need two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| that prove that you actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| and there is a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| so you just have to bring two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| if you want me to show you the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| let's look at somebody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| so here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| which one is this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| you go to that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| partial details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| to pull up this box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| the information tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| and you go here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-jan-0918-preview?start=2866)|
