| 0:00:33| Well, let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| Welcome, everyone, to the September 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Planning Commission Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| At this time, I will turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| I just have a few updates before we jump into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| I wanted to update you on a couple work program items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| that staff is working through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| which include wrapping up the Advanced Stocks Comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| The county anticipates reconvening the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| That's the first step in the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| We'll keep you updated on when that meeting gets scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| Staff is also working with our county colleagues on working through the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| for the Unified Development Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| This will be used to implement what we hope will be an adopted plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Our transportation planning staff have started work on the next mobility plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| Mobility Plan 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| So that's been kicked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| We anticipate a local adoption date of April 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| And that's it for my staff updates today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| We do have a couple changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Applicants for items six and 30 have requested to withdraw their items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| Those are still on your agenda for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| but we won't dive into those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| and those will need to be voted on at the meeting to officially withdraw those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| Six and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| So now we'll get started with Ms. Crockett for item number 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| which is an ordinance amendment that was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| So this amendment to the City of Knoxville Zoning Code Article 12 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| Landscape was proposed by Mr. Bentley Marlowe and postponed for 30 days by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| the Planning Commission in August 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| So a brief summary of the code amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| The first bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| the applicant proposed shifting the requirement of a landscape plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| from prior to the issuance of a building permit to prior to the issuance of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| COS, Certificate of Occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| The second aspect relates to Article 12.8 for buffer yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| So the applicant is modifying the reduction of a required buffer yard when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| fence or wall is present from 30% to 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| So the proposal is the buffer yard could be reduced to 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| The final element there eliminates buffer yard requirements for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| uses, single family, two family, townhouse, and detached multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| which was a definition proposed in a previous code amendment within the CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| district when it abuts residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| So staff's recommending denial of these amendments as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Landscaping and buffer yards have not been identified as barriers to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| creation of middle housing forms in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| And additionally, these amendments would apply to the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| And so further evaluation is needed to avoid unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| So some brief analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| starting with the modification to the requirement for a landscaping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| Applicants already have the capacity to submit alternative landscaping plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| based on site conditions or to provide a more creative interpretation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| The review of these can be time consuming for staff and applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| And the number of these applications would increase significantly if landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| plans aren't implemented until after a site is already developed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| structures and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Enforcement of landscaping requirements after construction would also be quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| And then finally the third bullet point here and in the analysis reiterates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| purpose of the landscaping code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| including creating open spaces with intentional design of drainage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| preserving existing natural resources, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| So designating landscape plans as secondary to building construction plans is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| contradictory to the purpose of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Looking at the proposed amendments to 12.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| there's not specific evidence provided to support a 70% reduction of the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| If this were applied to a class B buffer yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| which is required to be a minimum of 20 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| it would result in a buffer yard approximately six feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Within that six foot wide buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| it would be challenging to accommodate the required different kinds of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| and vegetation alongside a fence or wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Overall unintended consequences could arise as this would apply to all land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| uses or zoning districts where a buffer yard is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| And then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| the third point there just reiterates the reasoning for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| recommendation of denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| The middle housing scan did not identify landscape plans or buffers as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| barrier to middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| There was one recommendation associated with landscaping that addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| reducing interior side and rear setbacks for multifamily parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| And this recommendation is incorporated into the city's proposed middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| the staff recommendation is for denial of the amendments as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| And I'm happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| At the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| I volunteered to make some edits to this because I see a lot of merit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| I have typed up a alternative version of this request and I'm planning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| sending it out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| It doesn't conflict with anything reported or anything in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| but then I will most likely be proposing that we postpone again to give staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| time to look into this a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Thank you, Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Switch it over to Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Can I review item number 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Can I review item number 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:07:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| This is item number 14, case 9A23RZ, 9A23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| This is a county rezoning and plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| It's a 1.37 acre parcel on Island Home Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| It is in the county, but it's just outside the city border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| The request is to rezone from agricultural with an agricultural land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| classification to land residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| And to go to low density residential land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| the hillside protection overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| As you can see in the zoning layer, the county is generally zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| here, and in the city it's zoned R and 1, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| PR would be an outlier in this immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| This is the south city sector plan land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Most of this, or the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| most of the parcel is included in the hillside protection overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| and about a third of the property has slopes exceeding 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| The property is also part of a 220 acre boundary classified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| agricultural, and then beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| it is surrounded by the low density residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| It is noteworthy that the agricultural land use classification here isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=499)|

| 0:08:40| derived from significant community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| and it's likely that the agricultural designation here originated from an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| expressed desire by affected community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| As you can see in this note from the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| it does defer to the sector plan when it comes to future rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=532)|

| 0:09:01| And this area shows that the parcel is mostly undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| and the general area is rural with forested hillsides and sparse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=550)|

| 0:09:23| and it would be an outlier in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| This is a small parcel for this kind of unified development plan that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=566)|

| 0:09:37| that does limit the developable area significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=577)|

| 0:10:45| I'm just waiting for it to come up on the main screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Okay, so number 15, 9023RC, they're asking to go from agricultural to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| with up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Staff recommendation is to approve the RA zone instead of PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| The rationale is that PR is generally not intended for a property of this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| It's 1.61 acres because it's consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| So looking at the zoning, there is PR 1 to 5 around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| This one is kind of situated in the middle of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| However, the subdivision that's adjacent is built out with approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| two dwelling units per acre along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| They have some multifamily here, so they kind of divided up the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| So by the time they got the multifamily units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| the rest of the density ended up being at about one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| I'm sure you all remember the Belltown plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| that came through recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| That was approved in January of this year by a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| So that is one of the changes of conditions that meet approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| of a rezoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| And looking at surrounding uses, there's plenty of single-family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| around, multifamily as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| The aerial view, again, just kind of providing some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| And this site does have a closed contour line on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| It's just indicative of a detention pond that's already been built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| for this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| And you can see that on the plat right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| The sector plan has this shown as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Again, so the PR zone that they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| everything does meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| The main reason that we're recommending the RA is just because of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| So just looking at once you apply that 35-foot peripheral boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| you're really kind of taking away a lot of the site and kind of prohibiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| a lot of development on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| So we feel like RA is a better fit to be able to develop without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| 35-foot peripheral boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| And I'm sorry that it keeps going on and off back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| I'm happy to answer any questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| So the next one is number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| It's 9H23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| This one's located along Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Shod Road extension is just to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| They're asking to go from ag to PR with up to 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| This property probably looks familiar to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| There's been a number of rezonings in this area recently from A to RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| or to PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| This property went from A to PR and back to A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Now it's going back to PR again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| You can see from the aerial view the site does not have – well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| it's just off of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Ball Road's a major collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| so no traffic would be required through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| The site does not have significant slope or environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| but the zoning that they're requesting is consistent with whatever the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| So there's RA across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| RB, which does allow up to 12 dwelling units by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=838)|

| 0:14:32| which does allow consideration of the PR zone with a density of up to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| dwelling units per acre in the county's planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Neither the requested or recommended zones are in conflict with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| The proposal does not present any conflicts with any other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| So we're recommending approval of a lesser density, 4.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| just because it's more consistent with what's going on in the area than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| requested 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| I'm happy to answer any questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| How did you come up with the 4.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Well, basically just looking at the area and what the size of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| and kind of seeing – so if you look at – and, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| with the zoning slide, you can't really see what that density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| But these are 4 and 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| So we were just trying to be more consistent with the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| that are adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| What's the – the RB zone there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| What's the theoretical maximum density per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| It allows up to 12 dwelling units by right or up to 24 as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:54| Okay, so if there's no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Go ahead and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| So number 22 is 9L23RZ, 9B23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| They're asking to go from ag to PR with up to two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=963)|

| 0:16:10| use class to the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We're recommending denial of both, just basically because it doesn't meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=973)|

| 0:16:20| consistent with that south county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| And so looking at the aerial map, subject property is in an area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| wooded and hilly with residential and agricultural development being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| prominent land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| There's been no significant changes to the landscape in terms of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| or environmental conditions over the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| The applicant has stated they've conducted a PERC test for septic service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and it's not feasible on the site, so they will need to extend sewer lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| There are two sewer lines within 160 feet from the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1006)|

| 0:16:56| therefore does not meet the criteria for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| There's no obvious or significant error or omission in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1020)|

| 0:17:17| The ones that are adjacent here that are 0.5 acres, those were platted in 1955,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| which was when the ag zone allowed half-acre lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| so they're considered legal nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Even though they're 0.5 illegal nonconforming, their ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| as you all know now, requires one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| so even though it's consistent with the old ag zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| it's not consistent with that one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| which has been in the ag zone standards for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| It is in the rural area of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| and that allows a density up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| if certain criteria are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| However, the subject property does not meet those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| And the PR zone allows for flexibility due to site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| It prioritizes compatibility with adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| However, the subject property is not in the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| It doesn't have any FEMA floodplains or closed contour lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1089)|

| 0:18:19| And if the sector plan amendment is not as recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| a rezoning would be in conflict with the South County sector plan's ag land use class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and the South County sector plan recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| it supports PR with up to one dwelling unit per acre in the county's rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| so a rezoning would be in conflict with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| And for those reasons, we're recommending, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| to deny the sector plan amendment to RR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| and the rezoning to PR with two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and I'm happy to answer questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1123)|

| 0:20:23| because approximately 40% of the property is steeply sloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1223)|

| 0:20:54| this 45-acre property could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1254)|

| 0:21:12| this property could be developed at about 123 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1272)|

| 0:22:25| Staff believes that RA is more appropriate here as the PR zone is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| for large acreage sites with environmental constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1350)|

| 0:25:30| is a little bit off to the edge along Summit Hill and Henley and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and I'll show you that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Sector plan here is, and then the one you're planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| is mixed-use regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It allows the zoning that they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| as you expect the regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Mixed-use regional commercial is generally around the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| or other very major significant commercial nodes that we expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| The current use for the property is a surface parking lot that is adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| a TVA substation and also the State Street parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| Staff's recommendation is to deny the DKB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| The intent of the DKB zone is to accommodate uses and areas of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Knoxville that have developed in a manner characterized by wide planted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| boulevards and a green open landscape consisting of lawns, plazas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| and structures of variable setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| So you can think of Henley Street, Summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| the other places where DKB is along Naland Drive frontage and Hill Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| east of downtown, so areas where we have a bigger front setback than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| typical grid downtown area where everything's built up closer to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| which the DKG zone, which is currently zoned, is meant for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| I guess if anybody has any questions, I'll be happy to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| but basically this property doesn't really meet the intent of what the DKB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| which is the boulevard district, is intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Mike, would it be a problem to pull up the aerial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Could you do an aerial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| I'm guessing the reason that they want a rezoning here is so they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| to put commercial on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| A few of the downtown zones do not allow true multifamily structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| They only allow residential on the upper floors, and DKG zone is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| So here they would have to have non-residential uses on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| There's some interpretation of what that might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| but their plan that they have submitted and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| their design re-board has a good amount of non-residential uses already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| and some live-work units on the ground floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| which to my knowledge is still going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| The revision that they recently submitted, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Lindsay, you might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| But the plans approved by DRB had the live-work units on the ground floor, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| I believe five to seven townhouse residential units initially submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| and then they revised them to be a live-work space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| So why would they need the rezoning if that's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| They're still going forward with the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| We're recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I can't answer the question of why they're going forward with the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| As I look down this street here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I think there are some challenging areas of our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| that just where retail probably won't be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| or some other commercial use would not be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| As you look down this street, I think we have a church, a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| a KUB substation, a State Street garage, the rear of the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:19| the promenade, which is parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| and we may have some residential on the street level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| So I can see how this would be very, very problematic to try to make commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:37| I saw it at the State Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Dover and the group from Alabama did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| I don't think they put residential in, but they didn't really have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Was it a bicycle storage and maybe a workout for the residents only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| That might be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| I'm not sure if that was approved under the old zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| The old zoning ordinance did not have the same rigid standard that the new code does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| So the old C2 downtown zone did not have a prohibition against ground floor residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| The downtown design guidelines do discourage ground floor residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| but that's a recommendation and not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| So does the DKG outright prevent that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1836)|
| 0:30:46| or is it just recommended not to do that in the guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Well, in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| the DKG zone does not allow multifamily structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| which have ground floor residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I believe it's stated that it allows above ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| How do you enforce live work versus residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| That seems nearly impossible to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| And work could be, you know, that could be a broad term or definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| Just to comment on that from an architectural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| I think it's less about the enforcement and more about the ability to have live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| So having like a dedicated workspace within a dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| or connected to a dwelling unit I think is probably the intent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| I mean, what if I'm a self-proclaimed therapist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| and I've got a sofa and a chair in my living room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| How do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| And you've got a bedroom in the back and a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, I don't understand how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| A question for our colleagues in Plans Review and Inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| how they review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I think the intent would be those spaces can be also converted more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| I really don't know enough about the building code and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| but I'm sure there's a difference between a commercial build-out space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| and a residential, pure residential space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| That's my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I have a question about the model house properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| Doesn't that have residential and ground floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Yeah, similar to what we just talked about, the old C2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| the old downtown zone did not prohibit residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| My recollection is that the ground floor units were designed in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| to convert to commercial space if they so chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I could be mistaken on that, but that was my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:27| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I think that question should be a good question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:37| Is the live work defined anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, it's in the design code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:54| While he's looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I don't see how 5.2 actually prohibits dwellings on the ground floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:34:04| completely because it says mixed use developments slash dwellings above the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| ground floor, which I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| The slash seems to imply four, but I could be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:23| Yeah, so here's the definition for live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| I'll let you read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| but the interpretation for the DKG zone is that ground floor residential is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:35:01| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:15| live work is a bit more like you have outside employees that still can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| to your residence and patrons and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Other than having like an at-home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| like a graphic designer might have somebody that stops by every once in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| while, but really it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| doing work by themselves in their office space within their own home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| So live work is really intended to be more of a hybrid office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| commercial kind of space with also a living area in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Would a live work part of this building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| the facade front ground level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| what would that look like as it goes through permitting or through DRB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| Would it look like a townhome front door or would it look like a glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2159)|

| 0:36:06| It could be whatever the applicant chooses to propose and for the board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| And as long as it meets the standards and the boards and gets a board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| approval, then it can, it can be whatever it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| They want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2180)|
| 0:36:30| Any questions for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| It looks like you were getting ready to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| All right, we'll move on to item number 24 is Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Okay. So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I didn't get a chance to do my typical presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| So I'm going to just kind of go through these with the plans themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| and the maps on KJS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| But I just wanted to just give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| This has been before several times this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| This is the Beeler Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| That's been single family subdivision to attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| And now back to single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| It was pulled off the table last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So that could be back on the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Not a whole lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| As you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| this subdivision is intended to provide access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| potentially access to this adjacent subdivision that was approved at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| The,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| the proposal hasn't changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| They still have one access point to Beeler Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| There is a sidewalk along one side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| and there is the stub out to the adjacent property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| This plan will have a temporary turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| potentially if the development to the east does not get done at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| time as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| They don't show that on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| but that would be some reviewed and approved during the design plan phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Staff is no longer recommending approval as a condition stub out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| The property to the east already has two stub outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| We would expect those two stub outs to still be implemented through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| assuming that that project actually happens in the form that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| originally had approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| Staff recommendation is essentially the same as before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| besides the stub out condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| If you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I'll be happy to take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Next one is 9 SB 23C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| number 26 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| there was a review of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| There was a review of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| but it was not approved until the end of the development phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| So we are not going to be reviewing this property for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| The other thing that I want to talk about is the the relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| on the agenda. Just so you know, there was a revision provided yesterday. You should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| get that in the blue sheets today, so you should have them. The main change is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| staff was recommending a condition of finding a stub out to the eastern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| property line. They have adjusted their plan to provide that stub out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| east. Sorry, let me get a different, there we go, hand is a little bit easier to see on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| this map. So they are now providing that stub out to the east. There is a small, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| decent-sized property to the east that has frontage on both Shod Road and on Ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Road, so hopefully there could be a secondary connection to the road, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| another road, particularly Ball Road, if not another connection to Shod Road. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| show you where this is here. So just to the west of Amherst Elementary on Shod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| Road is where this property was rezoned earlier this year to a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| residential up to, I believe it was 4 dwelling units per acre, up to 3.3 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:24| per acre, sorry. So here's Amherst Elementary. The road, Shod Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| still under construction, so this project can't move forward until Shod Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| complete. You know, at this point we have a pretty good idea when Shod Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| going to be done. They just can't do any work until that is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| So let me show you. Shod Road is going to have a median here, so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| property in question is here. This is a little Betty Road and Shod and Ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Road. So there's a median in Shod Road. They can't turn left into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| the site, so it's going to be a one right in, right out access only. They have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| real steep or sharp turn into their property going down the hill because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| a very steep hill going into the property going down, and they have to cross a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| creek. Anyway, it's not the most ideal connection point, but for the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| units that they're proposing today, it's not the worst case scenario. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| going to be an unsafe condition necessarily. It's just not the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| convenient of connections. That's where hopefully in the future there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| another development next door that provides us another access point for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| everybody. These are attached units. There's 33 of them. Staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:52| a condition of maintaining or providing a type C landscape screening along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| western boundary and the northern boundary outside of the stream buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| There are large lot residential uses along those property lines. To the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| is still fairly agricultural, and I would presume at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| would be developed with more intense uses. There's a stream that runs through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| the site that they will be protecting with the standard stream buffers and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| on, but if anybody has any questions I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:38| Are there any other items that any of the commissioners would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:50| I wanted to ask Amy, I know you sent the email out about the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| website and it looked like we were going to be seeing something this month on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| planning agenda. Is that not right? You'll see it next month. It'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| on next month's agenda for the September. Yes, you're right. Okay. The city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| hosting two open houses that are coming up. One of them I know is on September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| 21st and I don't know if Lindsay remembers off the top of her head when the other one is, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| can look it up real quick. The 25th and 21st. And that is also on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| website, but I'd be happy to send that out to everybody. No, I think I was getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| ahead of myself. Okay, thanks. Sure, excellent. One question, you said item number 30 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:46| gonna be postponed? No, it's withdrawn. It'll be withdrawn. Okay. All right, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:55| thank you everybody. See you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230912-agenda-review?start=2635)|
