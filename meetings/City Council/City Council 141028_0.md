| 0:01:51| For the mayor's report tonight, we have a full house almost. This is really great to see so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| First, I want to recognize and welcome some guests that actually I think many of us met with before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| We're joined tonight by members of the first class, the inaugural class of Youth Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| And when I met with them earlier, we had a lot of good questions, a lot of good discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| so I was really pleased for that opportunity, and I understand that council had a chance to one-up each other in conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| Anyway, we are glad that we had this opportunity to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| I'd like all of you to stand up if you're part of Youth Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=147)|
| 0:02:38| I think Tammy White from Leadership Knoxville. Tammy, are you going to say a few words about the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| Okay. We all know Tammy as the executive director of Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you for being here, Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Rojero and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| It gives me great pleasure to be here on behalf of Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Our mission is to build people and to build groups to make Knoxville a greater community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| And this year, we're excited to say this is our 30th anniversary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| and we've done a lot of great things this year to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Leadership Knoxville and our working community continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Part of our goal has been to create a continuum of leadership, focusing on youth and going all the way to seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| And so tonight, it gives me great pleasure to be here with our inaugural class of Youth Leadership Knoxville, the class of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Give yourselves a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| We will be teaching them much about civic engagement and giving back to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| and I hope that one day that we'll find them sitting in the seats that you're in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| So thank you for hosting us, and thank you for supporting the work that we do in community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and please continue to support these young men and women. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you. Thanks, Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Now, we also have other students out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I understand there are some journalism students from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| You're here for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Wow, look at that. That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| Also, I met a couple of students from Hardin Valley who are here in AP government class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Now, are there other students from other classes that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Nobody's admitting, if you are, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Well, we're glad that you're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| You actually lucked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| This is a pretty short agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| But, you know, there's many meetings that are much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| You can always watch us on TV, on the community TV station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| But anyway, I'm sure after it's over, if any of you have questions for me or for any of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| we'll be glad to talk to you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| So next Tuesday, November 4th, is election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I know everybody up here knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Early voting ends this Thursday, October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| And I do want to encourage everyone who has not already voted to please vote and make sure that your voice is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| And we want to remind everybody that if you are a city voter, that we have five charter amendments on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| If you're a city voter, they're the very last items on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Five charter amendments, which council has approved to put on there, and we encourage you to vote for every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| It's too detailed to go into now, but there's plenty on our city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| If you go to cityofknoxville.org slash pension, and you can see the legal language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| which is very complicated because that's what lawyers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I don't know, Charles, you'll have to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| But the legal language that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| And then there's the explanation in plain English for the layperson that summarizes what it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| and then why I and this council are supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| So I encourage you to go and to learn about that, and we encourage you to support those pension amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=361)|
| 0:06:11| Okay, and then finally, on November 11th, the day of our next council meeting, is Veterans Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| And I know that's a big day in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| We have a wonderful parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I encourage everybody to come out to the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| I'll be there on Gay Street, and I'm sure many of council, most of council will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| It's the annual Veterans Day parade, which will begin at 1045 that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| So I look forward to seeing you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I just want to report and thank the citizens who showed up last night to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| and talk to representatives of the Tennessee Health Development Department out of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| They are conducting the certificate of need evaluation of the Tenova's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| to move the hospital out to Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| And there were people that spoke for and against it, and it was an example, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| of a healthy environment where people could present their views to representatives of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| These were not the decision-makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| But that decision will be made on November 19th in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| And I think they urge, and I certainly will urge anyone who's interested in the subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| to write to the Tennessee Department of Health and Safety that deals with hospital evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| and express your views in writing so that they can be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| It's November 19th in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Vice Mayor Patterson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| I would just like to take just a second to talk about the bike ride that we had with the elected officials last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| It was really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| The mayor was there, and I was there, Finbar, Mayor Brown, Mark, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| I mean, it's a great turnout, and it's getting larger and larger each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| But I think it kind of states where we are as elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| and where the path that, if you'll excuse the pun, that we want to take in making our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| You can traverse it a lot of different ways other than just, you know, fuel-burning cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| And I think that the strides in, you know, what we've been able to do over the last, gosh, 15, 20 years is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| And a lot of communities don't take that opportunity to take care of their environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| and help, you know, build these trails because it's not easy and it's not expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| But we've certainly made that a prerogative of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| And I just want to thank everyone that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| It was a huge crowd, and hopefully we will have more next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| So I think it's worth noting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| That's noteworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Yeah, that was a great ride, and it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I apologize to all the people who were behind me and Caroline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| We were at the front, and so all of these really fast cyclists had to, like George, had to kind of slow down and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| We might not have been as fast, but it was a great ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| It was fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=547)|

| 0:09:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=594)|

| 0:09:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Is Ms. Vaughn here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I heard she might be, and I just want to recognize her if she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Well, we appreciate her service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 23, Article 1 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| to add a new section requiring the adoption of a complete streets policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Councilman Delavopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Yeah, I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I don't know where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I'll leave that up to you guys, whether it belongs in the actual ordinance language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| or at the end of the policy statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| But, you know, it goes through the criteria that are used and the things that want to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| and I'm all in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| It does say that changes can be made in the future by the mayor without approval of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| I wonder if we could add a tail either to the policy or to the ordinance that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| but council shall be notified of all substantive changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| just sort of a report kind of thing as opposed to acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| I don't know if that should be objectionable or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| but it would be helpful for us to be told that we're changing the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| to accommodate some important need that's truly substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| and not just, you know, tweaking the words or minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| So I'll make that a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And I don't know whether we can amend the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| I'll leave that to Mr. Swanson or just to put that at the end of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| It would be my view that the best place for it, if you're going to put it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| would be in the policy itself, in the administrative policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| And, frankly, that's within the discretion of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| But if you all want to amend it to say that you urge the mayor to include that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| then certainly feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Motion to urge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| I said a motion to urge you to include that in your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| There's no second, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| So we already have a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| We just need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=718)|

| 0:13:27| credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Councilman Delavoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Let's get our motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Councilman Delavoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| We have Becky Wade here, and I think it would be helpful if she would briefly explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| The next three items, this and the next two items, are about a pilot or payment in lieu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| of tax kind of approach to, as I understand it, rehabilitate or help rehabilitate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| apartments for low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| But Becky's got the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Maybe she could tell us just a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Yes, all three of these resolutions are requesting payments in lieu of taxes on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| that now receive project-based Section 8 assistance and are affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| The owners are applying for low-income housing tax credits so that they can sell those, get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| development funds so that they can rehabilitate the apartments, basically do upgrades that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| have been needed to those units for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| They'll be adding insulation, new appliances, some security features, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| There's a policy at the state level now that allows assessors to consider the value of that tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| credit equity in the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| So, in other words, the current tax level would jump based on whatever that tax credit equity is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| invested in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| So these need to have the taxes kept at the current level so that they can remain affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| and also get the upgrades that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Carl Hagen is here from Lawlor Wood if there are any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| What I understand, basically, if without this kind of assistance or approach to the tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| that, in essence, we'll have old apartment buildings that will continue to decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| and they won't be serving the public that we need to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| These properties really can't cash flow if you count that equity in the tax assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| It's just it bumps the operating costs above what's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| So these properties will basically just sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Does Mr. Hagen have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| That may be it, but I think it's a great summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| So the way it's being assessed is a disincentive to do any improvements to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| The way it's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Mr. Hagen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| I had a discussion with Mr. Hagen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I'd like to just further augment what Councilman Della Vopi is saying with one of the facts of this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| Well, obviously, the investment that you're going to make, and I always welcome, you know, positive investment in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| But one of the issues is the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| I know that you all had an agreement with the former.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Yeah, with the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| And just if you could, you know, talk about that and just what exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| It's not an insignificant part of our rehabilitation plans to enhance the security features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Carl Hagen, 3215 Gibbs Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| We're going to be adding security camera features, perimeter fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| In the cases of both of these, we're going to be adding some off-duty KPD police details that don't exist right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| So it isn't just going to be an improvement of the amenity package and the improvement to these rapidly aging Section 8 assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| but we're hoping that it's going to improve the overall community environment from a security perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| both for the residents as well as their surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| So we're right now in the process of doing a renovation very similar to this at Town View Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Security is a big, big focus, big, big push for us there in addition to the physical improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| And we kind of see this as part of our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| We want to improve the physical asset and also improve the quality of life at properties like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| And this will all happen at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| There's no steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| It's contingent upon us getting the awards of these tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1052)|

| 0:19:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I was out there today and if my colleagues have an opportunity to go out and see what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| at this fantastic city park, I would encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| A number of buildings have been torn down and I'd like for Christy to kind of give us an update of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| and what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Christy Branscom, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| If you have been out there, you've seen that demolition is going extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| We are on schedule to be finished November, excuse me, February 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| The Department of Health building has been taken down, Waterside, which was really an attractive nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| and it was difficult to secure, is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| The three cottages just below the upper fields are getting ready to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| and then, of course, Chota, the large tower, is ongoing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| The demolition is almost complete on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| The administration building is being renovated and that renovation is going very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| We do expect, as I said, Demo to be complete February of 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| and thereafter KUB has been working with the city to develop a utility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| and they expect utility infrastructure to go in beginning in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| and that will be completed November of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| So, yeah, definitely go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| It's looking great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| We've had really good success with this contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and we really appreciate all their hard work and being conscientious to keep the greenway open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| and to keep the park available to everyone who's using it while they're out there doing their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| While you're at it, Christy, go ahead and add about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Yeah, just regarding this change order, so I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| You know, there are underground utilities out there that were put in by the state many, many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| We have no as-built surveys on anything out there that's underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| So when the demolition contractor is working or perhaps when KUB is working on installing their new utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| we may have occasion where we hit something that we're not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We do our very best to identify whatever is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| We do our best to avoid it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| but it's impossible with an as-built survey to really know what's underground out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| unfortunately, until sometimes we hit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And that's what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thankfully, they let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Yeah, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1290)|

| 0:21:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| to apply for a transportation alternatives grant from the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1300)|

| 0:22:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1321)|

| 0:22:32| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| 11G is a resolution expressing appreciation to Wayland Goodman Properties, L.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1353)|

| 0:22:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| This is another example of dirt being moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| The building that Aslan Foundation bought and gave to the city, that's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| That's been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| That's all cleared off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| And literally today I saw a bulldozer moving dirt back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| They're starting to dig into that hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1392)|

| 0:23:15| We're moving forward on that new entrance to Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| I know you're glad to see that too, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Cannon & Cannon, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| for professional engineering services for streetscapes improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| in connection with the development of the Marble Alley Lofts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| in an amount not to exceed $99,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Yeah, Bob Wessel explained this to us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| but I think it's worth asking so the public understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| There was engineering work done on some of these streetscape and public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| But as I understood it, Bob, ultimately we couldn't come to an agreement with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| on how that would be paid for and the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| And so you had agreed that you would take over the engineering contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| You can explain it better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| The original plan was that we would have the design and construction done by the development team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| working on the Marble Alley project because they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| We could not get to the right price with them on the construction portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| So we mutually agreed we will take over the plans at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| and then we will bid this out like it's any other city public works project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So we're going to get the plans from Cannon & Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| which is what's in front of you tonight, is to acquire those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| And then we will start the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| The next thing you'll see in front of you after this will be right-of-way acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| There's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| There's 11 right-of-way acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| This is a $1.5 million project to support a $30 million development that's in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| When do you think construction will start on the public improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| We are hoping to get started by next spring, early next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| That's one reason we were hoping to go the other route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| was to get that construction started while they were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| But we couldn't get to a price we felt comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| We felt like the most prudent thing to do was put it out for public bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1512)|

| 0:25:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| My name is Robert Wynkoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I live at 1309 Highland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| I'm also the owner of Jyrene Burger Company, located at 1927 Cumberland Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| I come today as a member of the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| looking for some support from the council and the mayor regarding a complex issue regarding the local merchants and the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| specifically related to the opening of a new building located on the corner of 17th and Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| which houses two Aramark food service concepts, franchise restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| The university purchased this building that was the former location of Rocky Top Books and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| or excuse me, McMillan's Books and Dynasty Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| They went to the state's building commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| and they said that this is going to be used for classroom space and administrative purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| However, last month the university opened a full service dining facility that is basically a retail food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| And we feel as local merchants that it is a threat to small business here on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| A year ago, just over a year ago, I got out of the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| I took out a small business loan, and I came to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| I'm not a Knoxville resident, but I chose to build my business and build my life here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And I brought my family here with the specific reason of coming to Cumberland Avenue and starting a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| However, since I've been there, I've noticed that the economic climate is extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| And so I started to research and started to look into why exactly this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| And the reason that I've found is the unique relationship between the multi-billion dollar corporation Aramark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| and the University of Tennessee has put small business at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| And some of these things I think are of very important interest to the citizens of Knoxville and as well to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| One of the most recent things that the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association has met with city leaders about is a parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| As I understand it, the new building on the corner of 17th and Cumberland has received a $5 million property valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| but is exempt from paying into what will be the tax increment financing of a future parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| If that's the case, I think that there's a problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| especially given why the next year the university will implement a mandatory dining dollars plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| which will essentially funnel about $13 million directly to the Aramark Corporation through their various franchise restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| just like the one on 17th and Cumberland, excuse me, the two on 17th and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| And currently the matter at issue is that they're able to accept a different form of payment than the local merchants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| Local merchants really can only accept cash and credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| They're able to accept a student dining card that is swiped just like a cash debit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| I found this to be a problem because the local Papa John's located on Lake Avenue is on the dining card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| and it is an independently owned franchise just like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| When I saw that this was the case, I thought something has got to be, you know, there's got to be some equity and some fairness here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| As all the members of council are aware, Cumberland Avenue is about to go through an enormous construction project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| which we all believe as merchants is going to be ultimately beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| but in the short term it could be very detrimental to our businesses just as the Henley Street Bridge project was on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1774)|
| 0:29:43| I ask that the council would engage the university and urge them to open up this dining dollars program to local merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1783)|
| 0:29:53| so that we may survive during this construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Local merchants are reporting declines of about 10% to 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| These are national brands like McDonald's, Firehouse Subs, Copper Cellar, you know, folks that have been around for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| and a small guy like me who's just starting out is even more threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| I know that my time is short, and I just would ask the council to take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| and see if there's anything that they could do to assist the local merchants in support of small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Be glad to talk to you when this is over, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Council, any other business from you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Seeing no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141028?start=1839)|
