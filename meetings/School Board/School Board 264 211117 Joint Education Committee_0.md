| 0:00:53| a co-chair and a Board of Education representative to be a co-chair. So do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=53)|

| 0:02:38| I can start this conversation since I serve on the superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| committee. So I had two pieces of information put at everyone's desk. Last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Wednesday the board voted to set the timeline and the day of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| So I have those two pieces of information there for you guys. The day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| of community input will be December 2nd and you can see there's a schedule of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| how the day will run, but you all will be invited at 1130 a.m. There's a luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| for public officials and community leaders at the Crowne Plaza and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| will be our opportunity to give our input on what characteristics we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| like to see in the next leader of our school system. This is an... it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| exciting time for Knox County. It's an exciting time for our schools. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| choosing the leader for 60,000 children, it's a big... it's a big responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| And then we also voted last Wednesday to set the timeline. So I have that here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| for you as well. Again, December 2nd is a big day for all of us with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| input. There's also an online survey where anybody can submit their comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| and all those comments will be public as well. We are working with TSBA, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| Tennessee School Board Association. They're helping to facilitate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| search. And on December the 8th, that is when the board will adopt the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| that will be used to create the brochure and the job description so we can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| looking for potential candidates. And then you can go through the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| February 15th through the 17th, the interview candidates. That will be also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| an important time. So the three to five final candidates will come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| on those days and have a day just to tour the community. That's when we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| interview them. So that'll be a big day for our community as well. And then July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| 1st is when the new superintendent will assume his position. If anyone wants to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| Yeah? Can I ask a couple questions? And this is, you know, since our meeting and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| didn't relate to substance, but is Carly here? I don't know. She was. Oh, hey. I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| wondering on our superintendent search timeline, I'm assuming this is what's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| line, could we actually put December 2nd community meetings on here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| actually put when the... I'm sorry, I'm not speaking... survey closes. Like I think just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| have those hard dates if somebody looks. I think that would just be helpful to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| put on there instead of we have November 11th through December 3rd. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| may be on the other page. Yeah, so it is on the website on a separate... so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| also on the website. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think it would just... and once again, like not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| seeing it on the website, it might be a little bit different. But I think if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| looking at this timeline, I don't think it would be clear to somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| December 2nd is... we're going through this process, but I think to actually put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| those hard dates there. Yeah. And then just that finalized date of this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| last date to do the survey. I mean, I've tried to put it and I would really say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| for everybody here to share it with as many people. I've put it on all my school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Facebook pages and my personal Facebook page. And what I've tried to let people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| know is I think people are like this isn't many community meetings, but like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| looked at the survey and I think actually the survey will actually give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| people more ability to give input that they shouldn't think that they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| physically be here. You know, I think the survey is a great way for people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| reach out about it. Yeah, I completely agree. Yeah, I agree, Virginia, because we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| going to be at all those meetings, but we're going to read every comment. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| exactly. I think that the survey is really important. Yeah. I also want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| to the survey is in Spanish as well, and so that's been added to the website. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| yeah, yeah. Especially, definitely Spanish-speaking communities that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| engaged with, make sure they know about the opportunity. Yeah, and I'm glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| you brought that up, because I was going to bring that up as well, if all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| could utilize our social media or just our friend circles to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| about the survey, let them know about the community meetings. And when you go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| KCS, when you go to the website, it is the first thing that comes up is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| timeline, a link to the survey, and then the schedule for the community day. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| one thing I would point out to the commissioners too, and I think this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| a suggestion of TSBA, that we will be at the luncheon that y'all have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| invited to, but they have actually asked the school board not to go to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| community meetings, just that that might, I think they felt like that would hinder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| people's comments or something like that. So just, we will only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| getting the feedback from the TSBA about what goes on at those. But hopefully y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| can all come to the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=452)|
| 0:08:02| I actually have clicked onto it, and that's the link I've shared, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=482)|
| 0:08:25| actually takes you to the thing. Yeah, yeah, but just so it doesn't make people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| click twice. Yeah, yeah, that's smart. So y'all, in these meetings, like we're, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| usually, unless y'all changed it last year, we usually, it's pretty much a free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| for all, so if you want to make a comment, please don't wait to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| recognized. Just, just a conversation. Yeah, the other thing I want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| too, especially for the commissioners, is we have two other surveys that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| happening right now in Knox County schools, which are also important. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| they don't close as early as the superintendent search one, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| released a survey for the budget for this coming year. What we want to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| instead of asking people what they think about the budget once the budget's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| already been decided, basically, is to start asking six months early. And so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| community can already start weighing in to their potential priorities that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| want to see for this coming year's budget, so that's available. And then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| our security department has, it's not, it's not a survey yet, but they've, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| application to be a part of a forum around community listening process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| school safety and security, so that's available, and then that survey will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| actually run in January. But if some, if people want to serve on forums, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| forums, to be able to speak into our law enforcement and security efforts in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| County schools, they can apply to do that right now. So, and Carly, are those, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| not, look, are the links to those surveys, are those opportunities also pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| prevalent on the website? I know you can get there eventually, but are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| somewhere in the header and their announcements? Okay, yeah. Anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=595)|

| 0:10:17| moved it to Andrew Johnson, I know there was a conversation about that. Yeah, Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=617)|

| 0:11:42| few minutes. I want to, first of all, just look at our calendar that involves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| where we are year-to-date, not only this fiscal year, but also in our early budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| build process for fiscal year 23, and then I want to give a short update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| expenditures and revenues year-to-date, and then look at some upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| challenges and potential opportunities, and then we'll have some time at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| for questions. So, I'm not sure you can see this real well, but I want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| out, the first slide just kind of, it has October and November in a different color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| shade there, because that's where we are currently. So, a few things that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| to point out here. One is, as you know from from being around for a while, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| staffing is a large chunk of our general purpose budget, and so right now we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| finished up doing what we call our staffing auditing, which is where we meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| with each high school and middle school principal to go over the staff they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| currently have in their building, reconcile that to the number that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| budgeted for the current fiscal year, and then we're in the middle of doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| same process with all of our elementary schools. And then the second part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| is in line with more of a budget outreach, which is not only do we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| have the surveys that of course go out to the community and the meetings, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| we also want to make sure we touch base with all of our stakeholders, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| right now planning some initial discussions with teacher advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| councils, principal advisory council, and then our PECA collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| conferencing group. And then the last thing I'll mention there that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| currently going on is, as Mr. Watson mentioned, there's the KCS video, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| is the intent of the video is to serve as just kind of an intro to the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| purpose budget. It's not fiscal year specific at this point, and it's also on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| the budget page if you go to Knox County Schools forward slash budget. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| the second part that's new to this this year is the budget survey. So the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| of that is, as we've said, we typically hold meetings in the spring, and then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| lot of times at that point the feedback you get, you're so far into the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| it's hard to incorporate it until the next fiscal year. So the intent here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| we talked about this at the board retreat a while back, the intent is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| get feedback from the community, and we thought just with all that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| this year that the initial way to step into that is through a survey. And so our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| intent is to get those results back and categorize those and bring those back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| the community meeting we have at the first of the year, and also obviously to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| the board and to the superintendent and the executive team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=873)|
| 0:14:44| And then the next few things I want to highlight, just the red circles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| there. So December, January, so if you think about our budget in terms of major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| categories, the services, materials, other, everything that falls below the wage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| benefit category of our budget, that's really built by individual meetings with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| every department lead in the district. And so we send out communication to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| those folks in December, and then as soon as we're back from Christmas break we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| we either meet with them virtually or in person. And the intent of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| is twofold. One is to review their current year-to-date expenditures, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| to give them an idea of where they are. Of course we send those out monthly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| them as well, but it's the first in-person conversation we have with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| about those expenditures. And then secondly, it is to get an idea of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| their plans are for next fiscal year, and that's where we start building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| everything that we call quote below the line in the budget, which is now wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| and benefits. And that takes up pretty much the entire month of January, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| process does. And then in February and March, going back to just the staffing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| little bit, I'll be looking at the percentages. I think the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| portion of our wage and salary category is about 61% of that whole category, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| so 61% of our wages and salaries are allocated actually through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| So it's a significant portion of our budget. And so what we do there is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| January, our enrollment department will give to us, based on a number of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| that they do with MPC, working with principals to see their roll-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| schedules for next year. And then we we run those through the formulas that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| currently have for elementary, middle, and high school teachers, assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| principals, counselors, clerical staff, and educational assistants. And then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| see what the results look like, and that's all based on, again, on projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| students for next year. And then we'll follow that up with meeting with grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| level directors, Mr. Trent and Ms. Thompson, and then superintendent and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| staff, and then we have individual meetings with board members to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| that before those allocations are released to principals in March of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| year. Yes, sir. Thank you. Is this the time where I get all these phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| that, hey, we're losing the teacher? More than likely, yes. So they step, walk me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| through the process. So we'll take Bonnie Kate, for example. Bonnie Kate's got about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| 350 students. Right. For some reason next year we're down to 310. Okay. Does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| mean I'm going to lose a teacher? How does that formula work? That's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| question, and thank you for the question. So essentially what we do is we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| it, like in Bonnie Kate's case, by grade level. And so as you know, students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| don't come in nice, neat bundles of 20 per classroom or 25. And so we take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| projected enrollment. K-3 is staffed at the 20 to 1 level. 25 to 1 is above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| that. And then, so what we do is we take those, run it through the formula, see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| what it looks like initially, but then get with Julie Thompson, who's the grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| level director for all of our elementary schools. And then she works with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| principal just to, you know, so for example, in that case, if you have, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| you're expecting 49 students in your kindergarten next year. Well, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| divide that by 20, you know, you're looking at three classrooms there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| But what if you get down to, say, 38 students and you divide that by 20, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| you're looking at less than two classrooms. But you can't put 38 in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| room, so that leads to two classrooms. That's why it's not so neatly divided in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| the elementary ranks. And so that's the beginning of it. And then if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| looked at Bonnie Kate and said, well, it looks like just based on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| projected enrollment, they're going to lose X number of positions next year, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| next step to that would be to meet with the superintendent, his staff and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| through, you know, for example, last year we had several schools that were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| that category. And so just based on the last year, I believe our B. E. P. R. A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| D. M. Was running about 2000 students lower than prior years for a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| different factors. So the superintendent on staff and the board agreed to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| everybody harmless in that case, basically meaning we're just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| keep you where you are until until things settle down a bit because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| fluctuations, which we haven't seen in a while. And then after those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| conversations are decided, I'll say this. Normally we cap. There are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| schools when we run through the formula that just based on the enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| projections, they may be looking to lose 5 to anywhere 10 positions. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| just to mitigate any potential, um, impact in the building for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| year. In my time in doing this, we've we've never said you're losing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| number of positions. We usually try to cap any loss at one or two just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| mitigate any any any harm at the building level. So that's kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Any other questions on staffing or anything I've said so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Sorry. Okay, here we go. Okay, so I'm gonna jump back a little bit into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1212)|
| 0:20:28| current fiscal year. And so just two slides quickly to look at expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| to date. And so really two metrics that we track in terms of expenditures to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| date. First of all, the overall expenditure budget, as you see, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| 542 million for the current fiscal year. And so the first one, and we talked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| little bit about this at the board retreat, is what we call unanticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| expenditures. And in other words, unbudgeted items. And those air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| approximately at 2.8 million year to date. And so if we look at, um, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| look at those expenditures year to date compared with with prior fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| those air in line with what we normally see. I think in the current year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| okay, it's about a half of a percent of our total overall budget. And those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| are typically things like once the school year starts, um, more students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| show up than we anticipate. Or, um, we need more nurses due to medically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| fragile students enrolling and need one on one, um, attention. So things of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| that nature is typically where those unbudgeted items come from. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| second metric is if we look at just year to date, and in this in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| of this slide, I ran these expenditures on, um, it says November the 10th. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| so that's really through the fourth period of the fiscal year. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| compare those to the same period of the fiscal year last year. And so if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| look at that this year, we're our burn rates about 28.2% compared to 28.1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| last year. So that means we've used that much of our general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| year to date. And so that again is an important metric for us just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| sure we're staying in line with what we should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So in the budget this year, you had was about a million dollars in there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| unanticipated expenses. That's correct. Yeah, this 2.8 above a million. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| So it's net about 1.8 when you take that out of it. Yeah, that's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| question. In years past, we've always tried to work that factor into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| budget. And as you know, I mean, sometimes a couple years ago, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| budget situation where we thought we were going to be in due to Kobe, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| couldn't budget a million dollars for an unanticipated. It looks to be, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| know, if we could budget that the way we really think we should, it looks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| be. If you look back several fiscal years, it looks like it's about a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| of a percent of our general purpose overall budget. So really, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| would feel more comfortable. We could say 2 to 2.5 million. But it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| hard to work that in with all the other needs of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Any other expenditure related questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| So just a couple slides on revenue. And I know Mr. McPherson talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| this, I think, the last joint ad meeting. So as you know, revenues are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| lot more static than expenditures just by the nature of our revenues. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| one that is not as static is local option sales tax. And so this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| and I'm not sure if you can see the numbers, but I'll just point out, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| think the next slide kind of circles it, if I can get to it. Yeah. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| top line there, and Chris Simons, our accounting director and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| department, do a great job of tracking this all year, and they compare it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| the prior two years. And so what we're seeing here is the first number, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| 17 million number, on the purple line there, that is the actual sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| collections, or increase year to year, for July collections. And we get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| report in September. And then the August collections we get in October. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| should be getting the September collections any time now. But you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| see, year to year, the increase there, just in July over last year, 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| million, and then 16.5 million for August. So what does that mean for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| district? So backing up a little bit to fiscal year 21, you remember we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| anticipated a huge reduction in sales tax collections. And so we were even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| afraid we're going to have to dip into fund balance to meet our expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| that year. We had a couple of months where we did have a downturn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| collections. But then as the year went on, we saw pretty incredible growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| throughout the year in local option sales taxes. That trend is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| In fact, if you backed up the last two to three months of the last fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| you would see even higher numbers than what you're seeing there on the purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| line. So hopefully that trend continues. We're monitoring it. So the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| then becomes, if we get into the spring, this trend is continuing, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| aggressive do you become in budgeting your sales tax collections? We always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| like to be on the conservative side of that, but there comes a point, too, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| where you don't want to leave money on the table, so to speak, that could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| towards goods and services. Any questions on sales tax? The one thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| will point out there before I go on is, if you look at the, I found this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| interesting, the two bottom lines, the last two fiscal years, the red one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| last fiscal year, then the green one's fiscal year 20. Those two did trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| upward from July and August, and then this year is the trend line is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| other way. And of course, that's just a one month trend line, but I'm anxious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| to see how that looks over the next couple of months. And of course, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| keep keep you guys aware of any any changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| So, Joe, I'm having trouble reading some of that. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| mean, that's fine. So on the purple, like when we look at July, I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| first dot is July. Yes, ma'am. So is it showing the revenue is that much higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| up than red and green? Yes, we're actually, our revenue is a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| than the past year. Yes, ma'am. Yes, yes. So this actually shows the year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| year growth in millions. So if you, if you look at the point you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| about their year to year, it's $17 million in growth that we're showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| there. And you see the last two years, I think it numbers 15.2 and 11.6. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| that is significantly higher than the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| 13.2. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Joe. Yes, sir. How are you, buddy? Good. Thank you. Um, entities that rely upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| sales tax get a certain advantage with inflation. As inflation rises, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| sales tax collected rises to it reaches a point that consumers turn away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| the markets. You have any idea where you think that point is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| Uh, yeah, I think that question is for someone that's probably an economist. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| don't. Randy, to be honest with you, I, um, but it is something you're, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| for the back of your mind, right? And so just in light of that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| discussions we've had just internally is that very thing, which is, um, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| know, in an inflationary environment, you're right. But then there also comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| that point. Um, and I saw, I think last month wages had decreased. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| comes an inflection point there to where you're right. I don't pretend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| know what that is, but but yes, I think that is a factor, which I think is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| we need to keep a close eye on this. Okay. And while we're on the topic of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| inflation, there's tangible supplies that you guys purchase gas, paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| products. Uh, how much of a factor have you built in for any allowances and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| inflation might affect this and what percentage of your budget goes to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| tangibles that are subject to market fluctuations? Uh, good question. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| the current fiscal year, all of those, all of our budgeted expenditures were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| based on the budget billed at the time of, you know, which was back in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| spring. So to your point, um, in the spring, it's, it's, it's difficult. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| was difficult, especially this past year to to predict any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| inflationary, um, change, especially the change that we've seen. Um, I, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| expect most of those items. I think about Mr Oaks and his team. Um, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| typically are pretty conservative on their fuel projections and materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| and supplies and maintenance and operations. So I suspect they do build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| in a bit of a cushion. But I think also, and I think about fuel prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| specifically, you know, I know we pay our bus driver or bus owners a fuel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| mileage index. So anything that goes above and beyond that fuel mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| index comes out of our current year budget. And based on the fuel mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| index, when the budget was built, I imagine that number is a lot higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| right now. So the potential was there to your point for, um, for more on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| budget expenditures than we anticipated for the rest of the year due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| inflation. Okay, I got one last question. It's about T. C. R. S. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| state has lowered their assumed. What is T. C. R. S. This is the retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| plan for teachers, uh, for, for the certified. Yes, they have lowered their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| rate of expectation and people think that sounds good. But what it does is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| it makes the gap of contributions larger. Have you all look to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| kind of impact that's gonna have on you all? Uh, you should. They lower the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| rate of I didn't hear what you said after that. They've lowered the rate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| return that they're they're actually put on assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| And so, uh, so, you know, so just to kind of explain that a little bit, T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| C. R. S. Is what we call a pension plan. Most of it is. So our legacy plan, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| be for, I think, certified employees that were hired prior to 2014. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| actuarily every year they give us a number to say, here's here's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1818)|

| 0:30:31| two or three years ago, we had the early retirement incentive and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| seen more folks retired due to that. So that number has started to go in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| other direction in terms of number of legacy plan employees, a number of T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1839)|

| 0:30:48| Yeah. So 5% of it is the defined benefit. And then 4% we do through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| just a traditional defined contribution matches. I think it's 6%. I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| 4% 6% are classified retirement. To your point, I think if they I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| where they lowered their number on on their return. So what typically that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| does, and I believe your point is right. I mean, it could lead to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| district having to increase the percentage that we contribute per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| employee next year. Um, again, my thought is, as we do not, I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| the numbers off the top of my head. But last year we saw a significant, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1880)|

| 0:31:28| we we take a look at all of our certified employees as a whole and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| we see how many of them are on the legacy plan and how many of them are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| the hybrid plan. Last year there was a significant shift in the percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| that were still on that legacy plan. So hopefully, as time progresses, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| gonna see less of an impact of such things. Um, going forward. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1904)|

| 0:31:59| the economy. And I actually brought up. I said, Do y'all talk to County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Commission or the county government? Because it was fascinating. I mean, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| really was one of the most interesting talks I've heard, and we maybe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| could get her to come to our group. But I even think County Commission on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| larger level, like all county commissioners. I mean, just the trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| that they're seeing and the projections that she had, I thought, was just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| interesting. And I think we all need to be paying more attention to him. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| that might actually be something we look at because it was just very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| informative. It could be something for our finance committee problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1951)|

| 0:33:04| Okay, so I'm gonna spend the rest of our time just looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| a couple of things that we consider challenges slash opportunities. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| this is a slide. If you're at the board retreat, you saw this one, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| it's significant. And so just to kind of sum it up at the top, we show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| you the second column is labeled BEPADM. So in everyday terms, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2004)|
| 0:33:33| that means is the number of students that our general purpose funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| based on for that fiscal year. We call it the BEPADM because it's average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| daily membership, and the BEP funds us through that number. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| third column over represents the budgeted teacher for that fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| And that's those air published in the back of our published general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| budgets. And then the last column is the ratio of just those two. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| point out that does not mean classroom size. It does. It's strictly a ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| of budgeted FTEs or budgeted teachers to the number of students we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| funded on. That's an important metric for us to track, because if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| funded on a portion of that and the other portion is what's going out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| terms of expenditures, then you should be aware of that correlation. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| ratio you see from 2017 through 22 and then 2023 is projected is 15.15 back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| in 2017, and that number is down to about 14.89. And I was curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| what the national average is, and I can't see my source on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| there from this far away, but I believe it's public school review or policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| review or something like that. But essentially the number up there is 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| to 1 is kind of the national ratio. So I point that out because I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| we're in a good spot in terms of just the ratio of budgeted teachers to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| number of students were funded on. The graph at the bottom does show the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| correlation I'm talking about. And so if you look back from 2017 up through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| 2021, you see a correlation that the top blue line being the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| FTEs that we were funded for for that fiscal year, the green line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| representing the number of teachers that we budgeted for that fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| You see it cross a bit in 2020 and then in 2021 it gets back what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| call right sized. And then 2022 you see it drop well below. So the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| is, why does that happen? How did that happen? And then how do we how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| maintain or get back to the correlation that we see historically? And so again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| I go back to Mr. Daly's question earlier about Bonnie Kate and a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| of students. So our funding, had it not been for the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| holding districts harmless for this year, we've been based on the 57,384| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| number you see there. Um, so instead, they they looked at, they ran the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| numbers based on, um, that that number. And then they also said, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| July fiscal year 20 BEP number is higher. We will use that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| instead. Well, our number was higher because it was based on more ADM at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| that point. Um, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| that's why you see the significant drop there. And so in students and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| significant gap and it comes from last year when we were going through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| staffing process, the district held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| every school harmless. So even though we may have projected you to have 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| fewer students or in some cases more than that, just to mitigate any, any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| any, um, changes in terms of culture in the building. We did not. We did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| reduce any classroom teachers last year. So that's why you see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| correlation drop like it is in the current fiscal year. The red lines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| just there to show you that's a projection. And so we're right now, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| believe, as of today, we should be getting what we call P three, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| our period three numbers 20 day periods throughout the school year. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| so the BP is based on a weighted average of periods 236 and seven. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| we have period two numbers, and that's I believe that's number I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| up there at 58 9 58. And that that number ends up accounting for 12.5% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| the weighted average. And then the number we will receive this week will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| be 17.5%. And then period six and seven, which, of course, are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| spring, will be the other 235% factors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| that that was the period to I don't know the exact date when period two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| ended. Um, but yes. And so the trend there, you see, tends to be going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| in the right direction. And our hope, of course, is that period three numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| once. So what we'll do, we'll get period three, take 17.5% of it. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| sorry. Well, at that point, we'll just take 50% of these because we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| have period six and seven numbers yet. Hopefully, once we get period three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| numbers, they'll be in that same realm, and then we'll see what it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2300)|

| 0:40:45| mean, as a state, we fund so poorly. I mean, and it's embarrassing to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| who we beat. I mean, it's not good. And the only thing it truly highlights is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2449)|

| 0:41:31| mean, I think I think we do a very good job. I mean, we can. We know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| what that money needs to be allocated toward. And, you know, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| it's people. We need additional hands on people. But we also, you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2499)|

| 0:42:59| something that's really been bothering me. And I talked to Scott Bolton about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211117-joint-education-committee?start=2579)|
