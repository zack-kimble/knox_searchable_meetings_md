| 0:13:35| Question that came to me on this one, and I think it was the Campbell Avenue closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=815)|
| 0:13:43| But when a part of this closure, I believe it says that existing utility facilities may be removed if not feasible for site development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=823)|
| 0:14:01| It was not clear to me if utility facilities had to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=841)|
| 0:14:12| At whose cost would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I'm going to ask Director Amy Brooks to field this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Miss Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| I'm not sure I'm the best person to answer that question in terms of who would be responsible for the cost associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Miss Welch, do you have any insight onto that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| I don't think I if you have any information, maybe something I'll tag team with our engineering director about because it's a right away closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| And it's also in the vicinity of the of the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| So I might let you start, Mr. Cannon, and then I'll pick it up on the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=897)|

| 0:15:18| Utilities within existing right of ways are typically the responsibility of the utility themselves to relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| That is a standard practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| If a utility has to be relocated because of work in that area, then the utility would be responsible for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=929)|
| 0:15:39| Miss Welch, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| I guess I was just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| The first part of the question was, will the utilities have to be relocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| And I would have to look into the specific this specific piece of right of way to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=947)|
| 0:15:57| And my question is only if it has to be removed, who pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| I have concerns about this agenda item in the next two agenda items because we have documents related to this development that are not finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=965)|
| 0:16:15| In my opinion, when I look at this potential closure and adding this to the development property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| It should be considered site preparation and any site preparation that's necessary for this property should be the responsibility of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=986)|
| 0:16:36| For that reason, I'm not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=996)|

| 0:19:28| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Is this ordinance related to the redevelopment agreement with KCDC for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1169)|
| 0:19:39| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Not the Magnolia Avenue redevelopment plan, but there will be a redevelopment agreement, Council Member Parker, with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1183)|
| 0:19:56| I mean, I have multiple concerns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| The overarching concern is that with negotiations still underway, agreements are not finalized, but an interlocal agreement is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1203)|
| 0:20:18| And the conditions that were attached to the previous road closures, I don't think it's attached to this one, require plan development approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1218)|
| 0:20:28| That's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Interlocal agreement funding approval, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So the final is design complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| But there are still multiple opportunities for the city to default on this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| And so this public land would go to a private entity for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| That's what I have a concern with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| If we default on the agreement, as I discussed last time, the property as described in the development agreement reverts back to the private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1253)|
| 0:21:08| Now we're adding public land to that project that could then revert back to a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1268)|

| 0:22:08| This ordinance, as I understand it, will allow exceptions for this development through the plan development process, including parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1328)|
| 0:22:21| The development agreement requires a parking study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| I don't feel that we should give an exception to the parking requirements before proper parking study is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| The parking study that's included in our packet is an older parking study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| So, we need the parking study from the development agreement finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1363)|

| 0:23:37| Is there a reason why this resolution restricts future funding or renewed funding to only the availability of ARPA funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1417)|
| 0:23:50| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1430)|

| 0:24:00| I think the child help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| That is one of the buckets that are available within the ARPA funding and that has just been part of our plan from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1443)|
| 0:24:13| But certainly from our standpoint, if we wanted to review other funding sources, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| But it has been part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| It has been part of the amendment that you approved that this body approved a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| And with that use of ARPA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| No, I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I think that this is a very important issue in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| And I can understand that we will wait and see a funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| The funds are available, but restricting it to one pot of funds struck me as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| I just wanted to raise that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1494)|

| 0:24:59| In the AIS, it comments on the regularly ongoing funding that we do annually for child health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| In the background, it says the city currently provides a smaller amount of annual funding to child health for these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| What pot of money does that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| The normal funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Yes, normal annual funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| That would just come from our normal budget funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Like community organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Yeah, I understand that it comes from tax dollars, but it comes from the community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| So we've been giving them money, and there's nothing in here that says we will not continue giving from that pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| This is over and above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And again, the ARPA funding specifically allows those type of expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=1540)|

| 0:54:28| Well, I saw that prevention and treatment initiatives were also allowed under this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| so I was wondering if KPD or the city had considered using the grant for other purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3275)|

| 0:54:52| So that would be a grant that goes towards the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3292)|

| 0:55:24| I'm making a big assumption here, but I assume that this is an opportunity to pay those officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| who are having to work so much overtime because we have a 20% increase in overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3329)|

| 0:56:00| I think I'm just trying to clarify that I assume that this is an opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| to pay for overtime for the officers who are working a 20% increase in overdose deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| so that we do not have to draw that from general, our general budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3379)|

| 0:56:24| My understanding is the grant can be used for prevention and treatment initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| but the city of Knoxville's application only focuses on police overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| And so while we have an opportunity to prevent the 450-something deaths that we saw last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3396)|

| 0:56:59| pursue through this grant options with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| And that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| That's a concern when the grant clearly states that the city can use the grant for treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| and prevention initiatives, but we choose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3433)|

| 1:04:06| And so I think today this is the commitment I know from Council, from where I sit, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| ensure that once this disparity study is completed, that we're intentional about holding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=3852)|

| 1:36:23| but you've got a grown white man who had the kid gloves applied to his situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| And as has already been identified, you don't need anyone's permission as the mayor to release the body count footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| or dash count footage or any additional footage that we can see right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| to clarify the stipulations and false narratives that are happening around Robert Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| in the custody of KPD and Knox County Sheriff's custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Yeah, hide behind TBI. David Roush is problematic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| He used to be the police of chief of Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| So if you really believe the public got faith in him, you are playing yourself as well at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| But as David pointed out, we are our ancestors' wildest dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| We are resilient. There will be no form of intimidation you can use to keep us from coming into these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| There will be no form of intimidation or arrests or charges you can find to keep us from exercising our freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| There is nothing you can do to stop the pressure that we are going to apply every single day of your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| as long as you hold the title of the mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| The real truth that I have at this point is, Knoxville, why did you put these folks back in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5851)|
| 1:37:39| Because, see, here's the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| In India, still got to come to this council and ask for things, particularly the checkbook part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| See, the money part comes through this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Just like in the county commission, the money comes through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| And so one of the clearest ways, when you have a misconduct department like KPD going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| you got to cut that checkbook off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| So giving them $80 million for a new building doesn't say we don't accept racism in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| Giving them new cars that they can spend $3 million on unmarked vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| doesn't say we don't tolerate sexual harassment and sexual assault in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| Giving them any type of monetary expenditure does not say we have a zero-tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| for unethical conduct in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| So here's your part, city council, as a collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| When are you going to stop writing checks to crooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| That's the real question. They're crooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| And that's why you can't get your gun violence under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| because who's going to admit to a fellow criminal who kills as well that they've been killing in the community too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| As has already been said, y'all are delusional in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Delusional is the word to call this entire council, really this entire government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| Y'all are delusional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| And heads up, India, you are under recall vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Next person signed up to speak is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5951)|
| 1:39:19| Mr. Ruggles, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5959)|

| 1:39:28| Hello. My name is Tom Ruggles, Lonis Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Mayor Kincannon, you're in a special position that you're one of the few people here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| that have the ability to answer the questions that me and some people speaking before me have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5978)|
| 1:39:46| as to the mysterious death of Robert Nathan Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| And before I dive into that, I'd like to read you a quote that you stated on April 19th of the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5991)|
| 1:39:59| And just to remind you folks, April 19th, that was seven days after the murder of Anthony Thompson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| And just like today, that day we had similar questions because there had not been any transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| There had not been any tapes released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| And the community had many of the same questions that they have about Robert Nathan Bailey today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| And so on April 19th, you stated, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| I support releasing any incident videos to the media and public as soon as they are legally allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| I'm committed to transparency and hope that a greater understanding of the circumstances will help our city heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6030)|
| 1:40:39| Well, Mayor Kincannon, I hate to say it, but less than a year since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| a family and a community is in a position where they need to begin to heal again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| because Robert Nathan Bailey died mysteriously five days ago in KPD custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| And no one knows anything about what happened to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| And the thing is, after you made that statement on April 19th, almost immediately after, Charmaine Allen released the tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| So you have the power to get the answers that we seek, that the whole community really should be asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6070)|
| 1:41:20| And yet you and everybody else in this room in front of me, with the exception of Miss Parker, has been dead silent on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6080)|
| 1:41:29| Hasn't raised any concerns about what happened to Robert Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| Well, I'm concerned about what happened to Robert Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6094)|

| 1:41:47| I mean, don't you think that his mother, his two sons or his daughter deserve to know what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| They've been sitting in the dark about this for five days, five days, and they have no idea what happened to their loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| They deserve answers. They deserve to know because they care about Robert Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6123)|

| 1:48:00| It's them because they keep those records sealed and they target low-income people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| probably because the legislation set up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| And you say that people are important, but the law says something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6488)|

| 1:48:16| That says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220111_202201?start=6496)|
