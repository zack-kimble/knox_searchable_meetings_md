| 0:01:53| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=117)|

| 0:02:04| We have one, which is 12H of 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| For the mayor's report, you all know, I'm sure, that TDOT Commissioner John Schroer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=134)|
| 0:02:23| came, was here in Knoxville yesterday for a press conference about the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| delays on the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| And prior to the press conference, the commissioner came to my office to meet with me, along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Mayor Burchett and Vice Mayor Pavlis, to discuss the situation and the necessity of the delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| So obviously, as I stated yesterday, I'm very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| I know we are all very, very disappointed in the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Now we are told that the bridge will be open to traffic on February 28th, by February 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| And then they'll actually still be continuing some cosmetic improvements until possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| as late as June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| But the traffic will still another year and a couple weeks, several weeks before the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| is on, is allowed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| So we know this is going to continue to have a negative impact on businesses in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| So we're really encouraging people to go south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| You can still cross the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| I see several south Knoxville friends and neighbors out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| You can cross the river easily on Gay Street and on the south Knoxville Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Please patronize the merchants that are there on Chapman Highway and that are continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| to stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| They need your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| There's also a website, which is www.southknoxisopen.com, southknoxisopen.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=224)|
| 0:03:53| And that will give you some more information about the businesses that are there and waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| for your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| I'd also like to remember and offer condolences on the passing of Maria De La Luz Comper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=239)|
| 0:04:08| whose beauty and grace lives on in every daffodil and flower that she planted in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| I know she worked very closely with our public service and recreation department to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| sure that we beautified our city facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| And of course, we all know that she planted more than a million daffodils, daffodil bulbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| along Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| So as I said at the service the other day, many of us were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Every time I see a daffodil, I'll think of Maria Comper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| And she is, you know, to have a life like that, to live to be 97 and then to leave that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| kind of an impact on the community, it's really something that all of us should aspire to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| I also want to just report to council, to the public, that next week on February 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=290)|
| 0:05:00| and 14th at the Crowne Plaza, the city of Knoxville will be hosting a site development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| symposium in conjunction with the Tennessee Stormwater Association in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| I think some of council may have signed up to participate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| This is a regional symposium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| It's for developers, surveyors, engineers, contractors, and others to learn about new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| regulations and best practices on everything from water runoff to low impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| It's an important conference and registration is already full, but I wanted to announce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| this so folks knew that this was happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| And I want to thank Brent Johnson and our stormwater and engineering staff for taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| the lead in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| They've done a great job in pulling it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| And finally, our annual budget retreat for city council and my staff will be held this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| year at the outdoor Knoxville Adventure Center over at the Volunteer Landing, where the Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| Parks Foundation offices are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| That is on Friday, February 15th from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| I'm looking forward to seeing all of you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Other councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I just wanted to ask a question following up something you just said, and that was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| I wonder if we could convince the community TV folks maybe to televise part of that symposium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| if that helps people who can't get in because they're locked out from registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| I don't know whether that's appropriate or not, but it's certainly something that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| could maybe even get some highlights for so that people could learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| It's going to be a big issue as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Christy Branscombe, Public Works Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| I do think we can talk with them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| We'll try to get in contact with them tomorrow and see if there's a way that they can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I want to thank you for mentioning about Marie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| We will be bringing a resolution from council at the next council meeting to honor her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| Also, I wanted to announce that the signed task force meets tomorrow at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| I know some of you are getting tired of hearing that, but we meet at 4 o'clock tomorrow at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| the KCDC building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| And also, Charles and I have had some conversations lately about the shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| You folks remember that both in East Knoxville and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| I've had several conversations with Sam Furrow about the situation out West in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Charles, do you want to just chime in and give council an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| We have not forgotten that the shingles are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| We are, I think, working diligently to try to cause that to not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| The owner of the West site, the Lexington Avenue site, has been, frankly, very cooperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| in that regard and is now, is in the process of entering into a contract with some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| who are going to come in and recycle those shingles and use them for asphalt purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| hopefully both here in the city and some other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| And we currently anticipate that there's going to be contractual language that will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| those shingles to be gone from that location by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| And we have been promised that we will be furnished with a copy of that contract and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| when it comes in I will forward a copy to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| It will not contain, the economic terms of that contract will be blacked out because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| that's really not our business and not our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| But the timing situation will be a part of the contract and that is of critical concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| to us and we will share that information with you just as soon as that contract is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| I have talked to the attorney who's doing it on behalf of the owner and that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| is currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| At the Borough Street site over on the east side, we just haven't had the same degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| of cooperation from the owners of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| We have done everything that I know that we can do to encourage that cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| I know that they have recently been served with a notice of intent to sue by folks related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| to water violations that may be occurring as a result of activity on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| That's not the city doing that, but that's a coalition of clean water groups who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| getting together and sending that notice of intent to sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| What we are doing at the city is preparing a complaint to file in the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| for common law nuisance and to abate that common law nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| We will be filing that complaint in the very near future simply because we haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| that same degree of cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| We had hoped that we would and we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Our next move is to go to court and ask the court to encourage that degree of cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| I believe the court will cooperate with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=594)|

| 0:15:43| As it's stated, it needs to be included in another portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| The wording would be, the motion would be to delete Section 22.5-21F and replace it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=949)|

| 0:16:50| This is something, simply, that was in the rules before, and when we brought this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| you on first reading, as we were revising the rules to put us in compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| Tennessee Qualifying Local Program, this paragraph was inadvertently taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| So this is a paragraph that had previously existed in our regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Am I stating this correctly, Christy and Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1034)|

| 0:17:37| Okay, so we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1059)|

| 0:17:41| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| So we are now working on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| That amendment has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Now, Councilman Campin, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Yeah, I think due to time constraints and deadlines, I wanted to make a second motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Right, and our law director will explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| You would ordinarily think that this being on second reading, you wouldn't need to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| When you make a substantive amendment to an item that's on second reading, it flips it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| back to first reading, and so this was a substantive amendment, and so it would be flipped back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| You would have to come back for second reading in two weeks if you do not amend it to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I'll second his motion, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| And again, it's a substantive change to what you first voted on, but it is the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| as we've had in the rules previously, so it's not a substantive change to our regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| So now we are back to the original motion as amended on emergency, and on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Councilman Del Vobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| I think this is a really interesting ordinance and approach that we're taking that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| been recognized as an entity that's got sufficient qualifying program to be able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| manage the stormwater and to do it in a way that hopefully has our contractors dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| with one set of rule makers rather than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| I don't know if this has been done elsewhere yet in Tennessee or not, or whether we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| all starting at the same time after the pilot program ended, but it certainly is an interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| process, and I'm looking forward to the implementation, and we're going to have, I'm sure, some bugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| to get out as we go forward, but we all know that we have areas where there's flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and in my district, especially in Fountain City, oftentimes there's flooding, and anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| we can do to make sure that development doesn't contribute to that is certainly a wise and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| prudent move on the part of the city, so I'm going to support this, but I do think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| a great program, and I hope that we do it in a way that does not discourage development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| but forces it into the right channels so it doesn't cause problems to others, so thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Yes, actually, I'm going to ask Christy to clarify that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Yeah, just to clarify, we are part of the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| This is a qualifying local program, and there are four jurisdictions in the state, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| one of those jurisdictions who has been selected along with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And the idea is to expedite the process of getting the permits, isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| To streamline the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| They would not need to apply with both entities, us and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| They would just need to apply with the city, and the city will manage that program for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| This should help our construction projects that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| This is as amended and on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| 9B is an ordinance amending Chapter 26, Article 4, Section 26-303 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1252)|

| 0:21:31| Yes, I wonder, I think I saw Art Seymour here, I was just wondering if he had anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| add from the appearance two weeks ago with regard to those two neighbors who seemed concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| at least that they might be isolated, cut off, and left out in the cold, and have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| had any further negotiations with them to try to resolve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1307)|

| 0:22:09| Well, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| The other question before you sit down is, I take it that we are at the point now where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| we agree that you guys are going to help us get that greenway built with the reservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| that if you have to move it in the future, you'll pay to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| We have a meeting Thursday afternoon with Ms. Wade and members of her department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| officials from Gerdau to thrash all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| And I think we're in agreement, but we just want to sit around the same table and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| sure we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1358)|

| 0:25:25| and directed to forward a true and correct copy of this resolution to Mr. Richmond's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| family to make them aware of City Council's action with respect to this matter. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you. I know we have some members of the Board, I believe, of South Knox Arts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| Heritage. Isn't there going to be a fundraiser in his honor for the organization? Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| like to just briefly announce that? Make sure people know. Come to the podium, Trudy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| just... You get a free pitch. Yeah, we're giving them an opportunity. This is what Charlie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| near and dear to Charlie's heart, so we're going to give them an opportunity to... Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Okay. I wasn't really prepared for this, but in memory of Charlie Richmond, who passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| away, was dear to all of us on the Board, and many people in this city. He was a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| person, and we miss him. We are having a dinner at the Candora Marble Building on February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| 14th. It will be a gourmet dinner. It starts at 6 o'clock with drinks and a tour of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| building, and at 7, a sit-down dinner with candlelight, roses, very, very special, romantic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| and to the theme of the Carnival of Venice, which has a mysterious flavor to it. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| in honor of Charlie. Charlie's mother was actually Italian, and Charlie visited Italy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| many times, so this will be in memory of him, and if anyone is interested in attending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| they can go to our website, which is candoramarble.org, and you can order tickets, and we hope to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| see many of you there, and again, we thank Charlie. We miss Charlie, and we're very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| to have had him as president of our Board for at least five years. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| you. Okay, we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| ayes have it, and so ordered. 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| on behalf of the City of Knoxville necessary to purchase a 2,713 square foot tract of real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| property, a 472 square foot permanent drainage easement, and a 994 square foot temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| construction easement within certain real property located at 6503 Westland Drive from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| Megan Grimsby for $13,250 as part of the Westland Drive Drainage and Bridge Improvements Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Move to approve. Second. Councilman Wallace. Well, there were several questions last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| or last meeting about this project, and Jim Hagerman sent out kind of an update on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| and I just wish you'd give us that again and tell us what this project's about and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| we're voting on these things one after another. Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| as I got down here tonight, I thought, boy, I probably should have printed that out. Whoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| Because I don't remember all the details, but the bottom line is that the two bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| will be widened by ten feet on the south side and different amounts on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1721)|
| 0:28:54| That will allow for a future sidewalk. Right-of-way will be expanded also by ten feet, if I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| right. So sometime in the future when we have the resources to do it, we can put in a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| in that stretch. But really the main emphasis is you've got drainage problem down Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| You're trying to correct it. That was the driver. That's the driver is your drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| It floods out into Westland Drive. Right, and so the creek channel is being modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| and there's several culverts that are being replaced with larger box culverts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1768)|
| 0:29:37| and the bridges themselves are, I think the clearance is being modified somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| and the extension is actually cantilevered out from there. There's also a question later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| from Councilman Starr about what they were going to look like, and as it turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| they're wide enough that they're not going to need any railing on them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| So you won't even know that they're bridges, pretty much, driving across them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| One of them, the one with the narrower shoulder width, will have a guardrail on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| but they won't really look very much like bridges. Good, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| Councilman Grave. Thank you, Mayor. Jim, just wanted to find out, there was some talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| at a couple of the meetings that we've had with KUB about the work that they're going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| What's the schedule, and are you working with KUB to see to it that we don't have both roads closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| at the same time? There's some discussion about, this is sort of a tear-off-the-band-aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| or pull-it-off-real-slowly kind of issue. There's some discussion about whether we want to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| go ahead and do it at the same time. That's still up in the air, but we're definitely working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| with KUB on that, and it's really going to be, to an extent, up to the community to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| what the best way is to approach the detours. We do have the flexibility with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| to wait on it, and KUB does not have the flexibility to wait on theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| KUB has been mandated, and I know I've gotten a number of phone calls of the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| that when people heard that that might be done at the same time in terms of traffic and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| If that's the community's preference, then that's the way we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| I think there's still some discussion to be had on that, and we'll probably try to cooperate with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1886)|
| 0:31:37| and use their discussion forums to discuss that particular issue too. I'm not sure that they know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1897)|
| 0:31:48| Keep me posted, and I'll also let you know when some of the neighborhood meetings are coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| so that the city can be there to talk about that situation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=1918)|

| 0:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| What is your name, sir, and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| My name is Gary Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| I'd like to say good evening to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Let me just tell you, sir, you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| I'm going to set the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| You have up to five minutes per council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2046)|

| 0:34:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Again, good evening, Madam Mayor, Council, all the other dignitaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Again, my name is Gary Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I live on Overton Lane and have been chosen as a spokesman for the Overton Lane, Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| Avenue, and Emory Road residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| At this time, I'd like to recognize those that have come to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| If you guys would stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| First, I'd like to say we're not against urban growth, but we are concerned on how that growth affects not only us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2075)|
| 0:34:45| but the I-75 corridor, the Emory Road itself, and the residents and the visitors that will be traveling through Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| on these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| A real concern that we have is the finger that we are into of city property that's basically surrounded by county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2096)|
| 0:35:06| And the difference is possibly in how that property is viewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| We basically have several issues of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| And after reading and reviewing the material that has been produced for this expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| first after reviewing the grading and site proposals submitted by Kroger's and the written verbiage on the flood plain or floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| these maps show raising the grade level from approximately 984 feet that's at the creek bed to 997 feet, which is 13 feet in elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2130)|
| 0:35:44| The property itself will come back 350 feet into this plain, which basically builds a lateral dam in that flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2144)|
| 0:35:59| We're also concerned about this proposal that the water under a flood situation will be pushed up onto our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| also causing channelization and possibly a backup of water onto portions of the I-75 southbound entrance ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2168)|
| 0:36:18| This backup also affects the 14 homes located on Overton Lane, along with five on Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2178)|
| 0:36:27| Also within this site, there's a proposal of filling approximately 14,000 square foot of regulated wetlands area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| This proposal, if passed, would also send presidents to fill, in the same manner, the property on the Phase II expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2197)|
| 0:36:48| Another concern is the traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| First, there's the flow of traffic entering and exiting the north side of the property at Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| There are 82 residences at Blueberry Road and an apartment complex, but this is their sole access to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| With the increased traffic entering and exiting the Kroger facility, it will make turning north on Emory Road a great hazard for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2226)|
| 0:37:15| Also is the proposal access road onto Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| This access would increase traffic extensively on what now is a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| The plan shows access of the easement from homes on Central Avenue diminishing their front yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| and also as traffic leaves the property at night, one homeowner will have headlights in their front door at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2258)|
| 0:37:49| We're asking for just careful consideration of our concerns as they are being considered by the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| We have two more speakers, Debbie Sahls and Dr. Collier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you for being here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Please state your name and address, and per Council rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| My name is Debbie Sahls. I live at 159 Overton Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| My property backs up to Beaver Creek behind the airport track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I fell in love with my landscape at first sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I purchased the lot understanding that the back portion adjacent to Beaver Creek was in a floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| and had the following restrictions, no dumping, no fill materials, and no building the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| I appreciate the beautiful landscapes and waterways in Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| and I believe what I saw, what I'd heard, and what I'd read from a community that was concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| and wanted to protect its natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| I was confident that the Beaver Creek watershed and the waterways that led to and from her floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| my backyard, would be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Over the next 22 years, I read many reports supportive in identifying issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| and taking appropriate actions to improve the health of Beaver Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| As many of y'all may have been part of this, and if you weren't, I'm sure you're familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| the North County Sector Plan states that the health of the watersheds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| and their respective drainage areas vary across the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Leaking septic systems, poor development practices, physical alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| were the primary contributors to poor water quality found in the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| In addition, the 2006 Watershed Green Infrastructure Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| looked at ways to develop Beaver Creek watershed while protecting its natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| utilizing smart growth and conservation concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| It recommended leaving areas that are environmentally sensitive for parks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| I believe, as do many of you here, even on the council, and as many of my neighbors do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| that such usage would probably be wisest way to develop many of our properties within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2401)|
| 0:40:10| Furthermore, based upon the Beaver Creek watershed assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| the primary impact to Beaver Creek includes sediment, nutrients, and pathogens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| from agriculture and urban runoff, and habitat alterations due primarily to land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| The assessment objectives provided data for use as a planning tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| to encourage development with low environmental impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| to mitigate future flooding, preserve environmental impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| and to preserve and restore wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and stabilize our stream banks for the length of the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| In regard to development, their particular importance for good concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| was also introduced by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| They stressed the importance of stream bank stabilization as it relates to erosion control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| flood control, water quality improvement, and wetland protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| However, a number of sites with degraded stream banks already existed in the Beaver Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| The North Sector Plan went on to state that the south side of Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| the very parcel of land being considered to own the Beaver Creek floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| they identified it clearly as a development constraint that needs to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| during rezoning and development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| In addition, the FEMA Materials for Floodplain Managers even warns that floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| have altered the floodplain landscape, continuously shaping it by the forces of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| and when you add human activities that disturb or change the lands and its coverings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| you generate more sediment, you cause more problems for our streams and creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| As we know, our landscapes are already being altered by human development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| affecting both the immediate floodplain and events up and downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Furthermore, the Association of State Floodplain Managers even says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| that they recognize the current federal standards are insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| because they allow for floodwater to be diverted onto others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| to channel conveyance to be reduced, essential valley areas to be filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| stream velocities to be changed without regard to the effects on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| In their white paper report, they identify a no adverse impact floodplain management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| whereby the action of one property owner does not adversely impact the rights of other property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| The EPA recognizes that the results of past actions have fragmented the health of our wetlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and waterways to the point where they may have long-term ecological and economical impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| Ma'am, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| In conclusion, there must be limits to actions that are detrimental to our natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| I still love this community and her beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I challenge each of you to be bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Fall in love with your community, her landscape, and natural resources all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| That should be your focus, our legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Don't be part of the problem, be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you, Ms. Sauls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| And now Dr. Robert Collier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Sir, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| And like the others, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| My name is Bob Collier, 326 Granville Corner Road in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I'm not going to be as eloquent as the other two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| I live a half a mile away from the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| I've lived there 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| I have about a quarter of a mile of Beaver Creek on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| I've been associated on the board of the Beaver Creek Watershed Association for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| so I'm pretty familiar with a lot of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| and it's interesting to me to sit here and listen to you all trying to fix flooding problems that have been created before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| just like we're about to create a new one tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| This is an interesting area because it's a little finger annexation of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| It buds out from the north side of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| It's surrounded on three sides for miles by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So what you all will be voting on tonight as city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| is really going to affect mostly Knox County citizens downstream from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| As we narrow the flood plain down, the water, millions of gallons of it that come out of these rainstorms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| like we've been having in January, for example, have to go the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| They have to go ten miles downstream to the Clinch River through Powell and Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| And as you put more fill into these land developments, the flood zone narrows more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| The water gets deeper and faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| In the 30 years we've lived on our property, large trees that were along the bank of Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| are now standing ten feet out into the middle of the creek where all the bank is washed away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| and a lot of people's yards have washed away as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| So I would like to offer just two or three quick observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| One is that the 100-year flood plain that the engineers have dreamed up in their cubicles is a fairy tale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| If you will come out the next time it rains four inches in 48 hours and look at our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| you will see where the 100-year flood plain is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| We've had 200-year flood plains a year for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| We had a 100-year flood in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| So we have a lot of water out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| We have intelligent and skilled engineers and all sorts of environmental people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| and city stormwater people who are totally capable of working out a plan for this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| that will still allow Kroger's to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and not further threaten the property of all these people downstream all the way to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| They can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| The knowledge is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| We have ordinances and the laws that need to be enforced to make the developers obey the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| and the engineers to design this project wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Finally, I'd like to reiterate what was said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| that you people on the city council, it's like a reverse of the water wars in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| You can vote whether or not to dump millions of gallons of water on us Knox County citizens with this action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2813)|
| 0:47:02| because you've got a little bitty finger up there of Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| and all the rest for 12 miles downstream is us poor downstream Knox County folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| So our plea is for you to study the facts and get a clear idea of what's involved here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| and please do the right thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you, Dr. Collier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Since it is part and right on the city county line, I met with these folks here, most of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| last week with Commissioner Larry Smith and certainly feel their concern and want to address all these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2858)|
| 0:47:48| I think hearing from Jim Hagerman would be appropriate just to explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| We're just rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| There still has to be stringent guidelines followed through city, county, and state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| But I would like to hear Jim explain why this is appropriate and being considered as okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2884)|
| 0:48:13| Well, I'd like to just start with a little bit of the regulatory framework that we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| First, FEMA requires that there be no fill within the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| That's sort of the definition of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| It's an area that you can fill up to without creating more than a certain defined amount of rise in the flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2909)|
| 0:48:42| We in Knoxville and Knox County both have gone beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| and defined another line that's farther back on the flood plain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| halfway between the floodway and the 100-year flood line in which fill is mostly prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2932)|
| 0:49:05| The only exception to that is if you can demonstrate that the fill placed in that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| will not create any increase in flood elevations or greater than a tenth of a foot, which is like 1.2 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2952)|
| 0:49:25| In addition to that, so bottom line there is if this proposal will succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| it's not going to increase flood elevations by more than 1.2 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| In addition to that, there will be on-site detention required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| so that there will be storage on the site that will keep it from no more runoff from the site than there was previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2984)|
| 0:49:55| I might note that that little paragraph that we had to add back in that we inadvertently deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| was the specific section that relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| It was the no-fill line between the floodway and the 100-year flood line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3007)|
| 0:50:17| The speaker actually had the elevation of the fill a little bit low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| The floor elevation of the finished building will be at 1,000 feet even, which is even higher than what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3024)|
| 0:50:33| but that is in order to get that floor elevation a foot above the 500-year flood elevation to protect them from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3033)|
| 0:50:43| There are recognized traffic issues that we're working through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| We're cooperating with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Both Emory Road and Central Avenue Pike are county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| They're not ours, but we will be requiring reasonable traffic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3055)|
| 0:51:05| There's going to be a light signal at Blueberry Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| I think it will probably have to be right in, right out, so you will not be able to make a left turn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3072)|
| 0:51:21| Wetlands is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| They're not our issue, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| That's Corps of Engineers, and we will be cooperating with them, but they're the authority on that part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| and most likely there will be some application for mitigation if there are wetlands damaged in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3093)|
| 0:51:42| Did I cover everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| It's looking at the property with spring heads and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| whatever wetland areas that will be impacted have to be mitigated at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Again, that's my point is just the concern for the citizens and people that live adjacent to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| just making sure that there's a guarantee that their property is not going to be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| I'm no engineer or hydrologist, but I've worked around stormwater for over a decade in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| and I can obviously see their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| That's what we trust is that the process is honest and open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and everything will be followed through that permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| And I also see their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| There has been a lot of development over the last decades all over the place that wasn't necessarily up to current standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| and the regulations nowadays are better than they used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| and I think if their proposal is to be built, it will have to meet the current regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| So it could still fail then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I see somebody standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Sir, do you represent Kroger on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| If you'd like to come counsel, if there's no objection, we'll allow him to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Please state your name and address, and as the others, you have up to five minutes per council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I'll do the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| My name is Paul Gianca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| I'm a Kroger real estate manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| I live in Marietta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I want to go through our history in a quick recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| All the projects we've done this far, Fountain City, the one in North Shore, Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| we've done stormwater quality devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| We've done filtration systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| The city is very proactive in their stormwater management and filtration process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| and when we bring them a project, they'll say, hey, how about a filtration system there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| We've got a really good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| In fact, I'd like to point out that we did the store in Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| There is a flooding that occurs west of us that actually floods out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| I believe it's called Ten Mile Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| and as part of our development project, we're holding the water that we're supposed to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| pursuant to the guidelines that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| but we also built an underground detention vault that has nothing to do with our water filtration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| but we're actually capturing water that's west of us because the city said, hey, we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| Can you help us fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| And I don't know that it fixes all of it, but we're doing our part to the community in trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| So to the points and the questions that was raised, this is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| First of all, we're going to rezone the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| The second process is UOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| The comments that were raised here today are coming up in our UOR meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| and I'll get to those in just a minute, but we'd like to move forward with the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| and then go through the details of the UOR process where all this will flush out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| And to that end, a gentleman raised a question about the Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| That already came up in our MPC meeting, and it's already been converted to a ride-in, ride-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| The concern with the Greenway, we are dedicating some land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| There's going to be a dedication of land for the Greenway in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| and the essential rules of engagement are you're not supposed to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| or build anything in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| And in the floodplain, you can do it as long as you can mitigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| So what's been happening, and as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| we walked the site around the 21st of January with the Corps of Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and we delineated all of the floodway lines and understand exactly what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Now our engineers are actually doing a model, and we'll present it to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| Oh, and I'm sorry, we've also been working with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Every meeting we've had with the city, the county's been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| so it's not like we're talking to one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Both parties know what we're doing because we don't view this as one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| It's kind of together the way it's woven together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| But we will, at the end of the day, present to the city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| and I still think we have to use the Corps of Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| but your rules now say it's the city, but I've mentally been gearing up for the Corps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| But we will design a project that doesn't cause any undue burden to anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| pursuant to the ordinances, and if we can't, then, as you guys just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| we're not going to build the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| So this is not a done deal by any stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I still, the Corps of Engineers has to sign off on a little bit of wetlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| that we're working on on the eastern boundary of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| The city has to comply or agree with our floodplain mitigation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| and then we have to provide traffic analysis to prove that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| our traffic intersection, we're making the right improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| at no detriment to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| If we don't pass those three hurdles, we don't have a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Could you spell your last name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I'll go slow. X-H-A-J-A-N-K-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| You're from East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Northern Virginia, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Next is Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Don't go far in case they do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| As I read through this information, I guess I was troubled that this went through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| on a consent approach, 13-zip, and that in the process of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| there was a removal of the floodway designation for part of this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| and I guess that enables it to move forward more as a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| But I was concerned that neighbors had written in that over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| their eyes had seen floodwaters on these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| and the fear that they expressed was the more you raise the elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| or put buildings or non-porous surfaces on the now-to-be Kroger track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| the more likely the water is going to be dumped onto their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And I'm really concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I understand that, at least from the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| somehow the floodway zone was changed in 2010 on some FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| Maybe Mark Donaldson or Jim, you can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| But that seemed to me to be the crux of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| and I don't understand why that floodway designation got changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| You seem to have a bit of a blue-line stream that goes halfway into this tract or parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| And how we get past that hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| I mean, what does removal of the floodway designation do to any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| other than facilitate its moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and maybe remove some of the restraints on how you build this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| And, Mark, you guys wrestled with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| so if you could tell us how we got here, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| The floodway designations being removed is just zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and the zoning is almost irrelevant to the way it's regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| It just regulates the kind of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| But the official regulatory floodway is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| The floodway zoning matches the 1983 FEMA flood map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| and it just hasn't changed because there is no reason to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| until somebody wanted to propose something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| The 1983 flood map has been modified a couple of times since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| partly because of better technology and partly just because of more data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| and partly because there have been proposals that looked at developing this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| and nearby sites, and so they were motivated to get some more data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| and do some more detailed study in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| Included in the data is the visual observations by neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| that this land was flooding in high water times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| Yeah, that's part of the calibration of the modeling process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| And, MPC, tell me why this issue was not debated very much at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| Maybe the neighbors didn't show up and didn't raise it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| although there were e-mails and correspondence to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| But it seems to me that we're heading into a direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| that may cause problems on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Obviously, we want good and healthy development in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| but we don't want to cause problems to others up downstream, across stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| wherever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Well, Mark Donaldson with MPC, the item was on our consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| because there was no one at the meeting to speak in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3624)|
| 1:00:33| We strive to put as many items on the consent agenda as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| We provide an opportunity to remove them from the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| prior to setting the agenda each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| So the moral is a civics lesson, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| As someone comes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| they could have asked for it to be taken off the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Did you in your study of the map see any concern about this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| of it being part of a floodway or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| As a result of the flood studies that Jim has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| it no longer is part of the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| and the old floodway boundary had not been modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| because no one had requested that it be modified up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| This gentleman, do you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| I just want to add that we have defined the boundaries of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| That's what we did in our walk with the Corps of Engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| on the 21st or 22nd of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| This is also a 50-acre track of land, and we are developing in 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| This entire 50-acre track, parts and pieces of it absorb water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| when there's a rush or deluge of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| So it's not an isolated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| I guess if you look at it, this is a very large bowl that holds a lot of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| and we're working in the 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| But part of our process is, yes, while we're filling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| we have to be able to show where that water would be displaced in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| and there are mitigation methods by which we can actually make some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| of the floodplain lower in elevation than they are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| which means you're still holding the same capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Are you saying a tradeoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| You dig it out there to resolve a fill here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| But this is not a small little channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| This is a 50-acre track of land, and I'm working in 18 of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| So you've got less than 50% you're saying you're going to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| And the flooding that happened, I mean, when it rained, I expected this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| We knew going into this that we would have to figure out how to mitigate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| so this didn't become a problem because we can't open –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| well, first of all, you can't give us a permit for a store if it's going to flood somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| We understand and respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| And quite frankly, we don't want to build a store that floods out people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| because that's a whole other issue altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| We don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| So we're going to do this right or else we're not going to do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I appreciate your good intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Did Kroger hold any meetings with the neighborhood folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| I mean, did they set up a meeting at the local church or school or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| to talk to locals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| The reason I haven't done that is I don't have the flood study back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| I don't have that flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| That flood study is a few days away from being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| But I didn't have the information to tell them that this is how we're going to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| because right now I'm conjecturing based on my experience level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| and what I know about this site and what I've seen and analyzed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| but I don't know specifically, okay, I'm going to do this in order to cure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| and I didn't want to go out half-baked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Would you be willing to hold such a meeting once you get that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And you would advertise it somehow to the neighborhood folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| so that they could be involved there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I guess my – I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Would you also like to call on Ms. Sauls as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Let me ask Charles or –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| At that point, Ms. Sauls, Councilman Greer will bring you back up in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| Charles or Mr. Frost, if you would address what happens if we act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| on this on first reading, can we delay the second reading if the meeting has not gone forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| and there isn't some discussion that involves these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| or must we do that delay the first reading in order for that gathering to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| and that information to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| In other words, is our option open either way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| If the lady can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Ms. Sauls, Councilman Grave is calling upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| I'm just seeking some clarification on – I believe, sir, you said you walked the area with the engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3874)|
| 1:04:44| Ma'am, please speak into the microphone so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| I believe this gentleman that was just up here said that he walked the area around the creek with the engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| The only thing I was going to ask is that I don't think you have what we gave the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| but, Council, I believe in the packet is a copy from the GIS, NOx GIS, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3908)|
| 1:05:20| that indicates a change in where the – and I get the names of whether it's floodway, floodplain, flood whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| but there is a line that is up and it's moved to cover one structure on the neighbor to one side of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| and is actually up into the barn on the other structure next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| And I wish somebody could clarify as to is that the new line that we should expect our waters to go to when it's flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3942)|
| 1:05:53| or can somebody look at that and please help us understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| I think that's fair to know before we ever had a meeting with somebody because we – it really makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3960)|
| 1:06:08| And the other thing I wanted to point out was I know I have read the same thing about there being a 2010 date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3968)|
| 1:06:18| on the last time that the maps were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| And I went on Flood Smart website and I just wanted to see what it would tell me as far as when maps were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3982)|
| 1:06:32| And I have this and I'd be glad to give it to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| but they indicate that they gave two preliminary maps to officials in the NOx county and NOx city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=3995)|
| 1:06:49| If I interpret this correctly and if I'm not interpreting correctly, I'll stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| But they did so in October of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| And that those maps are projected to have an effective date of August of this year, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4022)|
| 1:07:12| And I wondered if anybody could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Mr. Hangerman, can you address either one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| The first issue, I don't know where your neighbor's barn is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| but the lines on the flood map that is in the packet is the most recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4043)|
| 1:07:35| And the outside line is the 500-year flood, and just barely inside of that is the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| And the floodway is the much narrower zone near the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| Hold on a second, I don't know if they're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Are you able to hear what he's saying, Ms. Sauls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| The outside line on – you're speaking of this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| No, sir, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| I said the KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4087)|
| 1:08:16| It should be the same map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4096)|
| 1:08:30| It's white and blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| It's got a blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Are you talking about this one with the several colors on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| Yeah, page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Okay, I didn't – I don't get – I did not get a copy of that handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| It should be the same as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Well, actually, it's page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| It's multicolored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| See that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| It is – these are our homes right below the blue and the white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| And the dotted line is new as compared to previous maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| And in that, if you look, you can see between the line that indicates the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4152)|
| 1:09:22| there are structures within that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| So my question is, that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| So is this the 2010 map now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Or is this something that's been changed after the folks walked the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| and have decided that that's where the line's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Because I thought that's what I heard him say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| Ma'am, while they're looking at that, I want to ask you a question, Ms.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| that I noticed when Mr. Donaldson was speaking, talking about the consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| that a number of the folks back there were shaking their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Were you all not at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| My understanding was that there was a gentleman there to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Now, I haven't spoken with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| and our understanding was that he was not aware that that had been put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| I think you all call it consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| And so he was actually like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| I was at home watching it, and I actually called in and talked to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| And I said, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I said, why did that not come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| And first of all, CTV didn't have it so we could even hear the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| But he being there, he wasn't aware of the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| And so when it came around for us to speak, he wasn't there to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| Okay, looking at this map, I'll try to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Some of this is a little bit speculative since I don't know exactly what's on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| Jim, which map are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| This is the multicolored map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| This appears to be a land-use map rather than a flood zone map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| It says one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| It's a land-use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| The dashed line is the, as near as I can tell, the 500-year flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| You can see it goes all the way across Emory Road on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| And at the back of several properties behind Overton Lane, the blue is the old floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4287)|
| 1:11:45| which matches the regulatory floodway from the 1983 flood maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| So that's what is proposed to be removed, modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| modified to match the current regulatory floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| This isn't going to indicate the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| some of the design drawings, the proposed design drawings that I saw today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| did have the no-fill line, which is halfway in between the flood plain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| the 100-year flood plain line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| which is just barely inside the 500-year flood plain in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| And let me just double clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Floodway is the smaller space right adjacent to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| The flood plain is usually much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| I started rambling there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| 500, 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| You know, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Well, we may have to have, unless council, really I'm kind of letting you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| go a little further than typical on our rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| So council needs to ask the questions or call on you, anybody else on either side to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| Kind of try and pull this back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| But we can be sure to, Ms. Sauls, we can talk about this afterwards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Mr. Hagerman can spend time with you to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Just like some clarification, I would like to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| First of all, I'm familiar with your new store out at Cedar Bluff, and I do know what you folks did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4403)|
| 1:13:32| I'm talking to Kroger at this time, and I know you folks do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| and definitely pleased with what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| And I also know that there's a lot of hurdles that have to be done before this project can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| But one of the questions that I had, you mentioned that you have 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| You don't have the entire site, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| You just have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| So what we see on our map is the development of the 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| And one of the concerns I have, and Jim, maybe you can answer this, is that I think all of us realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| that eventually this site is going to be developed in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| And we also realize that it's going to have to follow the rules and regulations that are put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| My question is, are we actually building a mound right in the center of the site at this particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| On either side, on the east and the west, and I suppose that's on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| We're really building this site up at this particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Yes, because the floor elevation in the floodway, you can't build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| You can't fill it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Outside of the floodway, floor elevations are regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| Well, in addition to the city no-fill line, but basically floor elevations are regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| So in order to be legal in a floodplain, you have to elevate the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| And what you usually do to do that is you fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| And in this particular case, the fill also allows them to have some storage, some detention basins within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4495)|
| 1:15:04| I mean, you build the – instead of excavating a detention basin, you build up some walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| You and I ran into that situation out in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| My concern is over the entire site that it sounds like what's going to happen, because the way this is zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| is that just like Kroger's coming in and taking 18 acres, that the property to the east and to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| we're going to see this come back to us where someone's going to come in and want to build it up also, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Quite possibly to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| To the east, they have to deal with the wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| The wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Well, there's wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| There's official Corps of Engineers regulated wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| So right now what we're looking at is just that 18 acres, which would be a mound at the center of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| And, again, it's not going to go unless they can demonstrate that it does not increase flood elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| not only at that cross section but a half mile upstream and downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| And I think also then I just want to say to Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| you have made the commitment that you'll keep the neighborhood informed and meet with them as you go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| knowing if the hurdles can be met, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| I guess back to Mr. Hagerman, who has the regulatory authority over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Who decides whether it's impacted the floodway or not to the specifications that we just read into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| I mean, is that the Corps of Engineers has that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| The FEMA and the Corps deal with just the floodway part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| Beyond that, with the city no-fill line, that's our regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| We enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| And their regulations are stricter than what the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Those are much less strict in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| We are going way beyond what, I mean, we're regulating a much bigger area than just the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| And what we're being asked for tonight is to give them relief, relieve this floodway zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| change it back to where they can actually build in it with their fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| That's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| We're going to lessen the floodway zone so that they can have more commercial zoning to build their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4639)|
| 1:17:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| We are amending the floodway zone to its most recently studied boundary on a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4650)|
| 1:17:41| because it has come in requesting a change to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| We could have proactively done it throughout the city when that boundary changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| but we choose not to rezone in the general case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| But we're not impacting the full 50-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| I mean, I'm kind of back to what Duane Grief said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| I mean, I'm afraid you're creating a problem for the next developer that's going to be west of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| The next person in will also request to amend the floodway boundary to the most recent studied area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4689)|
| 1:18:19| But he will do it when he makes a request to change the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| It doesn't cause you any concern that we're modifying the floodway map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| given the pictures and the history, the known history of that flooding of that property for years and years, forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Y'all aren't concerned about that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| We're modifying the map to the most recently approved boundary as done through scientific methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| I just wanted to get some clarity for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| The site that we're discussing, does all of it lie in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| And the residents, most of their homes are actually in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| Is that the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Oh, actually, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| He hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| Yeah, I mean, I think I share some of the sentiment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| I assume that this floodplain was put in at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| It was zoned to flood for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| And what you're saying now is that's changed, that our flooding is worse now than it was before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| Because that just seems contrary to our whole experience that's going on across our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| that flooding problems seem to be getting worse with more development and more extreme storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| The floodway zone district that's shown on the maps today was based on the 1983 flood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4791)|
| 1:20:01| Since then, there have been more recent flood studies which have, in effect, decreased that boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| the width of that boundary on the north side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| which is not uncommon because when floodway and floodplain were first established on maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| they were done very conservatively without flood studies in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| And I guess I just had a question for the Kroger representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Is there a way that you could configure this development that it wouldn't be in the flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| I mean, I just have the hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I had one more question for Mr. Donaldson after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| First of all, I was corrected on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| It's actually not 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| It's actually 84.84 acres is what the property owner that we're buying the land from owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| That's an 84-acre track, and we're developing 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| And I was asking the question of the surveyor and the guy who's working from SM&E on our flood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| They're using old GIS data, which was not specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| They said approximately this is the contour of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| What happened in 2005 is they went through and physically measured the height of that entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| and from that they applied the flood study model and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| well, since the elevations are really here and not here, that changed the numbers and where the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| That's what pulled the line down in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| And what we're asking for kind of cleans up that old data, which was just kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| well, that looks about two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| We actually measured it and said it's a foot and a half, or it's three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| And that's what changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Well, excuse me, it was done in 2005, and we're now applying that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| which we've since corroborated to make sure it's consistent with the 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| and that's what we're asking as far as the reduction in the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| And my question was, could you do your development in the area that's not the current flood zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4914)|
| 1:22:06| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| A little bit north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Change the design of it so it's not in the current flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| The opportunity there is the only way we could structure this was to create these out parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| for the property owner that we're buying the land from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| These out parcels aren't ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Except the fuel center parcel, but the other two are not for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Because most of the development is not in the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| Am I correct there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| The majority of it, yes, is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Yeah, just mostly our building pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| The out parcels, are we not rezoning that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| But you're saying that's not part of your development, or I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| Technically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| That's why I'm confused, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| It's part of the rezoning application, and we're doing the out parcel one and out parcel two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| for the benefit of the Hinton family that owned the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| So those two parcels of land will be retained by the people that we are purchasing the land from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| The rest of the development is Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| And then for Mr. Donaldson, I'm new to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| Do we have a history of changing flood zone in other areas throughout the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| Or is there any precedent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| Let's be specific here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| There is a floodway zone in our zoning scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| That's different than a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| But the floodway zone, F1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| F1 is what we're talking about here, and that's this area below this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| The line was established prior to this request by a 1983 estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5034)|
| 1:24:03| Since then, there's been a flood study done in 2005, a letter of map revision that was approved in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5043)|
| 1:24:12| and a new firm map in 2010, which changes the edge of that floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| But we have not changed our boundary because no one has come in to ask for it to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| So this is unprecedented, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Whenever somebody has the occasion to request a change in the zoning map for their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5068)|
| 1:24:37| that's adjacent to a floodway zone that has been recently studied, it will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| I'd like to follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| I've got a couple of questions, but first of all, why don't we go ahead and rezone the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| instead of coming back to this two or three more times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| I mean, if we know, you know, just change it and go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Council may initiate that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Okay, that's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| The other question I have, when you're talking about the floodway and the changes that are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| how much of what development has occurred east of the interstate was taken into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| I mean, we have all that paved area and all the shopping centers and the motels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| and all that kind of stuff that are draining down into this creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Was that taken into consideration in terms of what we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| and then, you know, what's possibly going to be added when the Kroger's goes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| That's the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| But it also depends on, I mean, a flood study, a complete flood study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| involves surveying cross-sections, modeling what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| figuring out what the actual volume of water you will get at these different probability levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| That's been done since all this development has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| This was done in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| And, yeah, since a lot of it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| And actually, when they did that, they also looked at what it would look like if it was all built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| and how much water and, you know, just to bracket the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| And that's one reason both the county and the city went to the 500-year regulatory flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| instead of staying with the 100-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| And also why we went with the more conservative no-fill line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| which was halfway between the floodway and the 100-year flood line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| to take into account some of the future land use changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| and maintain some protection even as land use changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| Councilman Del Vobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| I think we have, for this meeting, beat this up enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| I would like to see us move forward with the understanding that there will be no final approval of this zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5215)|
| 1:27:05| rezoning until the public meeting has been held and the neighbors have had a chance to question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| Hopefully we have a city representative with the appropriate maps and that this be discussed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| But I'm going to, since we can go either way according to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| I'm going to move that we approve it but that we delay any final reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| You have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| We do already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Well, I'm going to amend it then that any final reading will be postponed for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| to allow ample time for one or more public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| so that hopefully they will have more information from their engineers, they can meet with the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| But we are going to affect, potentially, people's lives here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| and they ought to have a say in what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| And they ought to, since it's complicated, they ought to have a chance to understand all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| and we can hear back from them at the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| But I don't want to see this just go through in some rote fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| The other option is just to postpone it, but we've had all this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| so I'll ask that we actually, the amendment would be that we actually vote it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| but we add to it that we will delay any final reading for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| and require that a public meeting be held where information is shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| Sadly, that's not a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Tell me how we do it and we'll do it your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| That's the intent, and you can frame it in good legalese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| The proper motion would be, I mean, if you're going to pass this motion, it's going to come back in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| and then in two weeks it would be a proper motion to postpone it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| But if it's passed on first reading, the charter is going to require that it come back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| Now, you can postpone it now and not pass it on first reading and then take your time in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| But if you pass it on first reading, you can't append to that a change in the way the process works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| because it will have to come back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| And then you can tell people that you're going to postpone it and you can plan to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| but if you pass it on first reading, it will have to be back on your agenda in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| And can we have a condition that there be a public meeting with these folks to allow them to see the map information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5349)|
| 1:29:17| to have the engineers report to them from Kroger that they get an understanding of what is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| Because right now I don't feel comfortable that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| They have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| They have reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| They need to see the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| And so can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Yeah, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Or do we postpone the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| That's really your option is to postpone the whole thing and recommend that that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| But you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Once you pass it on first reading, then it comes back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| But you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| I mean, you can recommend that these meetings occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| and you can tell people that if it comes back in two weeks and these meetings haven't occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| we're not going to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| You can convey that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| But you can't condition it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| But you can't condition the motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I'd like to amend my motion to be a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| I second the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Because I think you'll have the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| You'll have some results back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| You'll have the study back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| You'll have more information before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| Well, if you want to take that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| On the other hand, they're not going to build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| I mean, this is just rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| This is not approving the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| So, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Will you have final design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| When will you have final design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| That will go through a long review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| And it's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| I'm probably talking beyond where I should be talking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| But one tool that this particular zoning gives you is it's a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| So, there are more approvals that are required in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| And perhaps somebody else should elaborate on that rather than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| The UOR that Mr. Janka referred to is the use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| which has been applied for and is currently scheduled to be on our February agenda at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5477)|
| 1:31:26| If acted upon favorably, it would be with the condition that the final zoning be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| That triggers the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| So, that is the first part of the final phase of the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| Hey, I wonder if someone can tell us from the applicant's standpoint if they can have their meeting in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| or whether they're not sure about their data and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| I mean, we don't really know the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| But I think our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| I'd just like to give, you know, you're kind of backing yourself into a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| You're going to approve the zoning and then it's subject to final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| I mean, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I just think we need to be comfortable that we're giving this floodway zoning away in an area that we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| has historic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Now, if they're convinced with the design, then I've got to trust the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| We just really don't have enough information based on what we've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| So, I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| I second it to postpone it until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Give us more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| To postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| I've got a couple other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| This is to speak to the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Just answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| I would feel more comfortable if we passed it on first reading tonight and then in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| if this meeting has not occurred with the neighbors, if some of the other data is not in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| then we could postpone the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| But these people have come out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| We've heard a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| A lot of things have been digested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| We all have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| If this was five years ago, I would have voted no on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| because I wouldn't be confident that we would be addressing any kind of water issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| And the history of the stormwater control, flooding control, has been checkered at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| And I'm not pointing fingers at anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I'm just saying that we've made big strides in addressing those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| And I don't think that MPC, and I've been assured that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| will not approve anything that's going to create a water problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| for the people who are sitting here tonight or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| So rather than postpone it and then, you know, two weeks we bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| and maybe we don't have what we need, then we postpone it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| I would suggest that we pass it tonight on the first reading and then in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| That would kind of put the pressure on people to get the meetings, get the things done, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| I would just soon postpone for some of the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| And I know all the checks and balances that have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| But I notice that Kroger is agreeing, and I think it would help the neighbors understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| And it would also say, okay, in two weeks we're going to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| or however long we're postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| So they know that within the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| both the neighbors are going to have to react and Kroger's is going to have to react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| So I would just as soon go ahead and postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| And that has nothing to do with the fact of how good the process is going to be from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| But I'd rather postpone now than wait and then postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| So I'm in favor of postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| Okay, so the motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| I heard three no's, so that's Campin, Palmer, and Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| So the motion passes five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| The motion passes, so this item is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| I hope that Jim will have someone at that meeting so that he can bring factual information to bear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5718)|

| 1:39:36| Anastasia, yes, Anastasia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| My name is Vinnie Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| I reside at 201 Locust Street, Apartment 1011, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| I have a suggestion for City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Can we have a construction company instead of KUB on the Lions View project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Fact is KUB put in pipes on Broadway and they did a bad job, I mean real bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| Stock construction company had to come back in, re-dig it up, and fix it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| Now, the City Council did approve this on the Lions View project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| but I'm asking you to reconsider to have a construction company do the Lions View projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| or any other projects that you approve for KUB because it would save the KUB customers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| and also would save the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| And also it would prevent a lot of traffic jams and a lot of waste of people who drive to there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6031)|
| 1:40:40| with these projects going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Also, Meryl here, could you call TDOT to have a public meeting on the Broadway Bridge project, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6045)|
| 1:40:55| so that we can understand when TDOT does do the Broadway Bridge that we know how long it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| so we don't have the problems with Henley Street Bridge that we're having now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| And then last one, the mayors of Chattanooga and Memphis, total they have $25 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6066)|
| 1:41:16| and they were considering, there was an article in the Metropulse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| and they wanted to know if the city would be interested in the near future of putting up a train station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Now, me, I would seriously want that to happen because I used to live in Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| and they're making a week, say, between $10,000 to $20,000 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| Revenue-wise, per year, they're making between, I'd say on an average, between $5 million to $6 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6102)|
| 1:41:50| And that's with labor, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| But the place is constantly packed, and we're talking holidays everywhere, every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| and they go all over the place, Washington, D.C., you name it, Boston, all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| So I would really like this council to reconsider having KUB do any project in the city to save the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6124)|
| 1:42:16| Like I said, I'm repeating myself again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| And also the KUB customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| And, Jim, on the storm drain projects, does that include your highway park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| I mean, seriously, because you really need to look into the highway park one of these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| because the last time we had a heavy storm, they had a picture in the newspaper, and the car was, like, buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6156)|
| 1:42:44| I mean, it was, like, flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| And I hope that we can get the storm drain projects fixed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| And I hope to God that you all really consider, by having construction companies, you know, put, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| do all the work for getting the storm drain problem done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Councilman Grave, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| Mayor, yes, I just wanted to say we've been working very closely with KUB on that particular project since it's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| And that project will go out for bids, and it will be done by a construction company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| KUB will not be doing the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Thank you, Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130205?start=6206)|
