| 0:09:33| Children are born with great potential for development and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=573.0)|

| 0:09:42| every child's trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=582.0)|
| 0:09:44| So we're going to talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:48| Early experiences affect the development of brain architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=588.0)|
| 0:09:52| which provides the foundation for all future learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=592.0)|

| 0:09:57| Children thrive in safe, stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=597.0)|
| 0:10:01| nurturing environments made up of supportive families, caregivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=601.0)|
| 0:10:06| neighborhoods, communities, schools, and child care environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=606.0)|
| 0:10:11| Eighty-five percent of brain volume is fully developed by three years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:16| Ninety percent by the time a child enters kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=616.0)|
| 0:10:21| The early years are the most active period for establishing neural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=621.0)|
| 0:10:25| connections, but new connections can form throughout our life span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:30| Thank goodness we can continue to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=630.0)|
| 0:10:32| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=632.0)|
| 0:10:34| In the first few years of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=634.0)|
| 0:10:36| one million new neural connections form every second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=636.0)|
| 0:10:40| which means every second counts for brain development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=640.0)|
| 0:10:43| A child is born primed for learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=643.0)|
| 0:10:46| and that child's experiences create and influence neural connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:50| As demonstrated by this picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:52| by the time we are two years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=652.0)|
| 0:10:54| neural connections abound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=654.0)|
| 0:10:56| Positive, healthy, growth-promoting experiences help to develop brains that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=656.0)|
| 0:11:01| are efficient and sophisticated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=661.0)|
| 0:11:04| But for some young children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=664.0)|
| 0:11:06| their developing brains are incorporating experiences that are abusive or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=666.0)|
| 0:11:10| profoundly neglectful, and these alter the brain's processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=670.0)|
| 0:11:14| sometimes for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=674.0)|

| 0:11:29| Circuits build on circuits, and skills produce skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=689.0)|
| 0:11:34| Note the prenatal period and the first year of life are extended in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=694.0)|

| 0:11:51| We see a rapid proliferation of neural connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=711.0)|
| 0:11:54| and that's followed by a drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=714.0)|
| 0:11:56| That's the natural process of pruning in which the brain becomes more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=716.0)|
| 0:12:00| efficient by eliminating connections not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=720.0)|
| 0:12:04| This is why serve and return and repetition and patterns and colors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=724.0)|

| 0:12:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=758.0)|
| 0:12:41| Providing young children with a healthy environment to which to learn and grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:44| is not only good for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=764.0)|
| 0:12:47| Economists have also shown that high-quality early childhood programs bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=767.0)|
| 0:12:51| impressive returns on investments to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=771.0)|
| 0:12:55| And yet, there is a very real mismatch between spending on programs to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=775.0)|
| 0:13:00| the brain and the brain's actual capacity for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=780.0)|
| 0:13:04| Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman's graph here depicts what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=784.0)|
| 0:13:08| calls the economics of human potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=788.0)|
| 0:13:11| For example, for every $1 invested in high-quality early intervention and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=791.0)|
| 0:13:16| educational programming for a child that is living in poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=796.0)|
| 0:13:20| we will see a $13 return on investment, a 13 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=800.0)|
| 0:13:25| That ROI decreases to less than 2 to 1 in the high school years and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=805.0)|
| 0:13:30| Again, it's not that our brains can't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=810.0)|
| 0:13:33| It's that they become more inefficient in their ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=813.0)|

| 0:14:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=840.0)|
| 0:14:02| Child care costs in Knox County, it's pretty staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:08| For typical costs for a center-based care in an infant in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=848.0)|
| 0:14:13| and that's certainly true here in Knox County, it's $10,800 a year just for one child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:20| It's higher than tuition, college tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=860.0)|
| 0:14:25| When we start to really break that out and look at disaggregated numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=865.0)|
| 0:14:30| that's 18% of the median household income for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=870.0)|

| 0:15:00| That's 32% of the median household income for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=900.0)|

| 0:15:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=915.0)|
| 0:15:18| So it's no surprise that access, availability, and affordability to high-quality child care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=918.0)|
| 0:15:24| continues to be a challenge for Knox County families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=924.0)|

| 0:16:08| This message is not just an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=968.0)|
| 0:16:10| It comes from neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics, behavioral and social science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=970.0)|
| 0:16:15| and even from economic analysis of human capital development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=975.0)|
| 0:16:20| What all of these sciences tell us is that healthy development in the early years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=980.0)|
| 0:16:23| means children will be more successful and lead healthier, longer lives in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=983.0)|
| 0:16:29| and as adults, that they will be more productive contributors to the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=989.0)|
| 0:16:34| more responsible participants in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=994.0)|
| 0:16:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=998.0)|
| 0:16:40| So here in Knoxville, Knox County, we began an 18-month-long strategic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1000.0)|
| 0:16:49| and we did this in partnership with Tennesseans for Quality Early Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1009.0)|
| 0:16:54| They developed a Bright Start Tennessee cohort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1014.0)|
| 0:16:57| so there are six communities across the state of Tennessee that were all leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1017.0)|
| 0:17:02| local early care and education strategic plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1022.0)|
| 0:17:05| We were one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1025.0)|
| 0:17:07| And through that process, we went through pretty deep community interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1027.0)|
| 0:17:14| stakeholder interviews, focus groups, surveys, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1034.0)|
| 0:17:20| to truly understand what is the need in Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1040.0)|
| 0:17:24| around birth through age eight learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1044.0)|
| 0:17:27| What is the need for our families and caregivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1047.0)|
| 0:17:30| What are the needs for our practitioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1050.0)|
| 0:17:33| Here's a quick snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1053.0)|
| 0:17:37| We have all been talking about the third-grade retention law, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1057.0)|
| 0:17:42| and the connections to how our children are measured in third-grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1062.0)|
| 0:17:49| So, of course, that bubbled up as a major need and concern to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1069.0)|
| 0:17:55| Forty percent of children ages zero through five living at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1075.0)|
| 0:17:58| or near federal poverty guidelines in Knox County, that's a big need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1078.0)|
| 0:18:02| Child care sector has lost nearly ten percent of its workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1082.0)|
| 0:18:06| This is impacting access to reliable, accessible, and affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1086.0)|
| 0:18:09| high-quality child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1089.0)|
| 0:18:12| And 40 percent of kindergartners nationally, and we can assume a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1092.0)|
| 0:18:18| probably pretty similar number here for Knox County, are not entering ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1098.0)|
| 0:18:22| learn because of pretty significant developmental delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1102.0)|
| 0:18:26| COVID, of course, has impacted that pretty significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1106.0)|
| 0:18:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1111.0)|
| 0:18:33| So what are we hoping to do about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1113.0)|
| 0:18:36| We have set a vision to achieve high-quality continuum of learning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1116.0)|
| 0:18:44| all children birth through age eight, that's through third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1124.0)|
| 0:18:48| And to do that, we feel like we need to focus on three core domains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1128.0)|
| 0:18:52| high-quality birth to age eight learning environments, supported and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1132.0)|
| 0:18:56| supportive families and communities, health, mental health, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1136.0)|
| 0:19:01| development on track beginning at birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1141.0)|
| 0:19:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1144.0)|
| 0:19:07| Our key priorities prioritize strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1147.0)|
| 0:19:10| Again, these were developed with community voice, lived experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1150.0)|
| 0:19:15| practitioner voice, stakeholder voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1155.0)|
| 0:19:20| First is to expand all core tutoring support for K through third graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1160.0)|
| 0:19:24| in out-of-school environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1164.0)|
| 0:19:27| Development of an early care and education workforce development system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1167.0)|
| 0:19:30| to strengthen the attraction and retention pipeline into the early care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1170.0)|

| 0:19:40| This is to strengthen the business of child care across a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1180.0)|
| 0:19:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1187.0)|
| 0:19:49| And the second domain for supported and supportive families and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1189.0)|
| 0:19:53| our focus will be to develop an early care and education resource hub and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1193.0)|
| 0:19:57| supporting awareness campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1197.0)|

| 0:20:07| And the development of a transition plan from pre-K to K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1207.0)|
| 0:20:12| helping support parents and caregivers in their understanding of what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1212.0)|
| 0:20:17| means to be kindergarten ready and equally supporting our schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1217.0)|
| 0:20:21| helping them be ready for the kiddos that are coming their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1221.0)|
| 0:20:25| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1225.0)|
| 0:20:27| In the third domain we see expanded support and awareness of evidence-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1227.0)|
| 0:20:32| early intervention services, both home-based and clinic-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1232.0)|
| 0:20:36| Expansion of family-centered mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1236.0)|
| 0:20:39| Expanded support of the community school strategy and additional place-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1239.0)|
| 0:20:44| strategies that support early childhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1244.0)|
| 0:20:47| And assessing pediatric provider awareness of early childhood developmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1247.0)|
| 0:20:51| needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1251.0)|
| 0:20:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1253.0)|
| 0:20:55| We have a variety of communication campaigns that we think are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1255.0)|
| 0:20:59| Again, in helping Knoxville-Knox County-ans understand exactly what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1259.0)|
| 0:21:05| happening in early care environments, how critical brain development is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1265.0)|
| 0:21:10| this space, and what every single person in the county can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1270.0)|
| 0:21:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1277.0)|
| 0:21:20| Hopefully, for now, what we're asking is for you to help us share the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1280.0)|
| 0:21:27| If you go to the United Way website, you can download the full action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1287.0)|

| 0:21:38| But we do have a very comprehensive breakdown of the data analysis that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1298.0)|
| 0:21:44| found of those community conversations and focus groups, the root factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1304.0)|
| 0:21:49| analysis that we really dug into to help us identify what our gaps and needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1309.0)|
| 0:21:54| and assets were in our communities, and, of course, the prioritized strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1314.0)|
| 0:21:59| and the details behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1319.0)|
| 0:22:01| The overall cost for the recommendations of this plan are around $26 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1321.0)|
| 0:22:06| It's a big lift over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1326.0)|
| 0:22:09| And it's going to take a shared collaborative effort to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1329.0)|
| 0:22:15| We'd love to share more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1335.0)|
| 0:22:18| We'd share more details if you want to host a Lunch and Learn event, if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1338.0)|
| 0:22:24| would like to join one of our action team committees that are responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1344.0)|
| 0:22:28| deploying the work and implementing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1348.0)|
| 0:22:31| We have a variety of policy recommendations that are also outlined in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1351.0)|

| 0:22:41| funding opportunities and creative funding opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1361.0)|
| 0:22:45| We hope to collaborate with each of you, and I'd love to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1365.0)|

| 0:22:52| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1372.0)|
| 0:22:58| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1378.0)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1380.0)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1381.0)|
| 0:23:02| Is this being shared with all the community or United Way partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1382.0)|
| 0:23:09| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1389.0)|
| 0:23:10| We have not actually sent them out to our funded community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1390.0)|
| 0:23:15| but that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1395.0)|
| 0:23:17| We had a very public launch a couple weeks ago and had over 50 organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1397.0)|

| 0:23:24| So we had a good start, but I think we probably need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1404.0)|
| 0:23:28| Speaking of collaboration, you know, a lot of this comes to mind with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1408.0)|
| 0:23:32| Boys and Girls Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1412.0)|
| 0:23:34| Yes, they're a key partner for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1414.0)|
| 0:23:36| I hope that that effort will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1416.0)|
| 0:23:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1419.0)|

| 0:23:45| Ms. Kittrell, you talked about the funding model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1425.0)|
| 0:23:49| Is any of that estimate that you presented funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1429.0)|
| 0:23:52| or is that sort of an optimistic goal of what you hope to rally to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1432.0)|
| 0:23:58| thing real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1438.0)|
| 0:24:00| We do have almost 5 million of it funded and identified funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1440.0)|
| 0:24:05| so it's still fairly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1445.0)|

| 0:25:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1531.0)|
| 0:25:32| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1532.0)|
| 0:25:33| Mark Siegel, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1533.0)|
| 0:25:35| I'm here to speak about the request for a subpoena of the sheriff in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1535.0)|
| 0:25:41| McAllister-Delhi incident and also whether or not it's advisable to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1541.0)|
| 0:25:50| citizen review commission for the sheriff's department as there is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1550.0)|
| 0:25:57| Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1557.0)|
| 0:26:01| I'd rather, frankly, be here speaking in support of law enforcement than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1561.0)|
| 0:26:06| being critical of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1566.0)|
| 0:26:08| Law enforcement is probably the most critical governmental responsibility in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1568.0)|
| 0:26:14| a civilized society, but it's also one of the easiest ways for freedoms to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1574.0)|
| 0:26:26| off the tracks if not properly accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1586.0)|
| 0:26:32| We have a situation here where there has not been proper accountability from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1592.0)|
| 0:26:39| sheriff's department about an incident in which a 15-year-old member of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:46| community has suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1606.0)|
| 0:26:50| I do not know what happened at McAllister-Delhi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1610.0)|
| 0:26:56| I've heard rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1616.0)|
| 0:26:58| I've heard different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1618.0)|
| 0:27:01| But I do know that the communications officer of the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:06| should not have rushed out to elevate this on her personal social media account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1626.0)|
| 0:27:12| in violation of departmental policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1632.0)|
| 0:27:17| I do know that when an elected official in this community representing concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1637.0)|
| 0:27:25| of a community asks that the sheriff's department come forward and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:34| what happened, that the sheriff's department should not have answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1654.0)|
| 0:27:40| flippantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1660.0)|
| 0:27:42| The sheriff's department should have been willing to come forward and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1662.0)|
| 0:27:49| what happened and to answer the questions which were raised or would be raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1669.0)|
| 0:27:58| and that has not happened in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1678.0)|
| 0:28:05| That's why it's so important when you talk about law enforcement that you talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1685.0)|
| 0:28:09| about protecting and serving because we need law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1689.0)|
| 0:28:17| We need them to do a job that's difficult, but we also need them to do it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1697.0)|
| 0:28:24| respect to us and not just me but all members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1704.0)|
| 0:28:31| They all deserve the respectful treatment of law enforcement, and that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1711.0)|
| 0:28:38| believe that in this case a subpoena should go forward to the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1718.0)|
| 0:28:45| and why I believe that this commission should consider a community review commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1725.0)|
| 0:28:53| like exists in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1733.0)|
| 0:28:57| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1737.0)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1740.0)|
| 0:29:03| Next on the list is Constance Everey, followed by Deidre Harper and Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1743.0)|
| 0:29:09| Ms. Everey, if you would please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1749.0)|
| 0:29:13| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1753.0)|
| 0:29:15| My name is Constance Everey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1755.0)|
| 0:29:16| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1756.0)|
| 0:29:18| We are past a subpoena because to me who should really be vetted here for answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1758.0)|
| 0:29:25| is District Attorney Charm Allen because she's the one who allows the conduct of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1765.0)|
| 0:29:31| jurisdictions of the police departments in her jurisdiction of Knox County as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1771.0)|
| 0:29:35| minister of justice to continue this kind of behavior going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1775.0)|
| 0:29:40| I thought or I knew, better yet, at Anthony Thompson, Jr., she showed me who she was when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1780.0)|
| 0:29:47| she failed to hold those officers accountable for the child's murder in a high school bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1787.0)|
| 0:29:52| But then I thought, well, maybe the council will start to raise concerns about Charm Allen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1792.0)|
| 0:29:57| and our oversight of our police departments and their conduct when we had KPD finding out we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1797.0)|
| 0:30:03| qualified NASCAR drivers and he killed someone in his operations under state law that he's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1803.0)|
| 0:30:09| to have his lights and his sirens on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1809.0)|
| 0:30:11| That cost us dollars as taxpayers in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1811.0)|
| 0:30:14| But then I thought maybe when we had the KPD cop who took home the blood evidence from a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1814.0)|
| 0:30:19| scene and that he forgot about it so long his wife returned on his behalf, I thought then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:25| then maybe the council, the county commission will ask Charm Allen what is her operation of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1825.0)|
| 0:30:31| But yet we are continuing to see this misconduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1831.0)|
| 0:30:34| More importantly, if we're going to really talk about Knox County Sheriff's Department, let's talk about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1834.0)|
| 0:30:38| Kimberly Gwinn should have been fired a long time ago because she has been caught lying under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1838.0)|
| 0:30:43| When police officers had that drunken night down in the old city and bar fighting and wrecking cop cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1843.0)|
| 0:30:49| and they tried to cover it all up, she should have been fired then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1849.0)|
| 0:30:52| But you all fail to hold accountability time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1852.0)|
| 0:30:56| That is why when I become mayor of Knoxville, I'm going to call for the Department of Justice to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1856.0)|
| 0:31:01| investigate the entire city and county because I cannot do due diligence to my constituents of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1861.0)|
| 0:31:07| and the true justice of identity here without making sure first Charm Allen is held accountable for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1867.0)|
| 0:31:13| obstruction of justice and her criminal content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1873.0)|
| 0:31:16| This happens, as I've already stated, because police immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1876.0)|
| 0:31:19| For the black folks here, this is why you don't become friends and partnerships and tokens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1879.0)|
| 0:31:23| because when you take their gifts and money and we want to hold them accountable, we get nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1883.0)|
| 0:31:27| because you are being bought and paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1887.0)|
| 0:31:29| That's why it's called the plantation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1889.0)|
| 0:31:31| If we were being serious, we would have been called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1891.0)|
| 0:31:34| Many things that were happening because at the same price that I want to spend on the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1894.0)|
| 0:31:38| it costs half of that cost to restore HBCU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1898.0)|
| 0:31:41| So you see, Knoxville, again, these are failed leaderships for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1901.0)|
| 0:31:47| You do not want to be like this leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1907.0)|
| 0:31:49| A whole lot of talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1909.0)|
| 0:31:51| But when it's time for action, they show time and time again their true cards because I can't forget about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1911.0)|
| 0:31:56| Courtney Durette being there when we first found out the murder of Ed Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1916.0)|
| 0:32:00| And this is what I've been talking about, inviting white folks to the cookout because they come to look at our pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1920.0)|
| 0:32:05| They come to watch us be in distraught and confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1925.0)|
| 0:32:08| They watch us suffer, but they do not help us because she's been chairman of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:14| I have not heard her once speak up on behalf of black issues in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1934.0)|
| 0:32:17| So this is why you don't bring them to our safe spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1937.0)|
| 0:32:20| It's a violation of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1940.0)|
| 0:32:22| But again, Knoxville, I am running for mayor 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1942.0)|
| 0:32:26| I plan on bringing true justice to Knoxville and Knox County because it is no longer acceptable how these council members operate nor move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1946.0)|
| 0:32:34| More concerned with rich people agendas than they have ever been with poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1954.0)|
| 0:32:37| More concerned with what we're going to do on a baseball stadium than they have ever been about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1957.0)|
| 0:32:40| More concerned about what we're going to do for a pedestrian walkway than they have ever been about youth gun violence and lack of youth enrichment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1960.0)|
| 0:32:45| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1965.0)|
| 0:32:52| Next on our list is Deidre Harper, followed by Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1972.0)|

| 0:34:32| Thank you, Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2072.0)|
| 0:34:36| Hi, Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2076.0)|
| 0:34:41| My parents divorced before I turned one years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2081.0)|
| 0:34:47| I grew up most of the time in Anchorage, Alaska, but I would come down to Tennessee in the summers to visit my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2087.0)|
| 0:34:55| And I wasn't sure how old I was, but I was a young child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2095.0)|
| 0:34:58| I was in grade school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2098.0)|
| 0:35:00| I was sitting on my father's couch watching American Gladiators, and one of the contestants was in a climbing competition, climbing up a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2100.0)|
| 0:35:07| My father was in the kitchen frying bologna sandwiches for lunch, and he leaned over the back of the couch, and he whispered to me, that n-word climbs up that pole just like a monkey climbs up a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2107.0)|
| 0:35:23| I was way too young to really know what to say to that, so I just went to my room, and I didn't talk to him for the rest of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2123.0)|
| 0:35:34| The next day, I was helping him in his garden, which was a daily practice when I visited him, and I think he was picking cucumbers, and he just stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2134.0)|
| 0:35:48| And he looked at me, and he said, son, what I said yesterday was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2148.0)|
| 0:35:54| What I said yesterday was bad, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2154.0)|
| 0:36:00| And despite the flaws my father had, I've always respected him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:07| That was one of the more valuable lessons that I learned as a child was to take responsibility for your failings and own up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2167.0)|
| 0:36:20| Now, there is no way that these subpoenas can make Ms. Thompson whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:29| She has been permanently damaged by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2189.0)|
| 0:36:33| But if you go forward with these subpoenas, and you uncover some facts that warrant an apology to Ms. Thompson, and you do that, what you are doing is restoring people's faith in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2193.0)|
| 0:36:52| You're restoring integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2212.0)|
| 0:36:54| You're restoring transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2214.0)|
| 0:36:57| You're restoring honor to this county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2217.0)|
| 0:37:01| I've been before you multiple times begging for you and the mayor and the sheriff's office to raise Knox County deputy salaries, and that's extremely necessary because when we have pay this low, the standards have to come down with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2221.0)|
| 0:37:21| And that's how we get in these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2241.0)|
| 0:37:24| Now, I haven't seen any of the videotapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2244.0)|
| 0:37:27| I haven't talked to any of the deputies that were involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2247.0)|
| 0:37:31| I have not talked to Kimberly Glenn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2251.0)|
| 0:37:33| I have not talked to Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2253.0)|
| 0:37:35| I haven't talked to the managers or the CEO of McAllister's Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2255.0)|
| 0:37:42| But I'd like you to see if Ms. Thompson deserves an apology, and if she does, give one to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2262.0)|
| 0:37:49| Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2269.0)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2270.0)|

| 0:48:15| I've got my question answered by the law director, Mr. Butte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2895.0)|
| 0:48:19| stating that when the mayor sends a committee recommendation, we have to accept it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2899.0)|
| 0:48:25| or we have to refuse all of them, send them back to the mayor, and ask for a new list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2905.0)|

| 0:48:45| Normally it's for the mayor to recommend and the commission to approve or not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2925.0)|

| 0:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3185.0)|

| 1:03:42| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3822.0)|
| 1:03:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3825.0)|
| 1:03:47| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3827.0)|
| 1:03:52| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3832.0)|
| 1:03:54| With a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:58| Commissioner Daley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3838.0)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3841.0)|
| 1:04:02| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3842.0)|
| 1:04:13| How you doing, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3853.0)|
| 1:04:14| Yes, sir, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3854.0)|
| 1:04:15| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3855.0)|
| 1:04:16| I'm happy for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3856.0)|
| 1:04:19| Just about two months too late, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3859.0)|
| 1:04:22| Give us an update on basically what this ordinance will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3862.0)|
| 1:04:27| Will it affect the city of Knoxville or just the town of Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3867.0)|
| 1:04:32| Just give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3872.0)|
| 1:04:34| I know we've got two more readings on it, but just give us something to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3874.0)|
| 1:04:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3877.0)|
| 1:04:38| Really, the city of Knoxville stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3878.0)|
| 1:04:41| It is part of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3881.0)|
| 1:04:44| so those conditions we have the ability to enforce presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3884.0)|
| 1:04:50| This ordinance would allow us to enforce Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3890.0)|
| 1:04:54| recommendations or Planning Commission requirements, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3894.0)|
| 1:04:58| outside of that jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3898.0)|
| 1:05:00| So they could be an adjacent county potentially, town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3900.0)|
| 1:05:07| potentially a state route inside one of those other jurisdictions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3907.0)|
| 1:05:13| So it does that plus more things that I would propose that I think would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3913.0)|
| 1:05:18| help my department and ultimately help the constituents is allow us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3918.0)|
| 1:05:23| or Engineering and Public Works, to actively manage the off-site improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3923.0)|
| 1:05:29| Right now we kind of do that on a little bit of a, you know, as-needed basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3929.0)|
| 1:05:36| but we feel like that my department's better served to do that just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3936.0)|
| 1:05:42| that's, you know, we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3942.0)|
| 1:05:45| one of the things that we do really well is widen roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3945.0)|
| 1:05:49| So we would like to have that ability to, for the developer to enter an MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3949.0)|
| 1:05:55| with the county to allow Engineering to manage the road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3955.0)|
| 1:06:00| as required by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3960.0)|
| 1:06:03| and just reimburse the county for those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3963.0)|
| 1:06:06| That way we can do what we're good at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3966.0)|
| 1:06:09| and the developer can, you know, do what he's good at, which is greenfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3969.0)|
| 1:06:14| No project will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3974.0)|
| 1:06:17| It's not going to be like a 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3977.0)|
| 1:06:20| It could vary from different project to different project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3980.0)|
| 1:06:23| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3983.0)|
| 1:06:24| And they will give you the money, and they don't have to do any work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3984.0)|
| 1:06:29| It will all be done by Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3989.0)|
| 1:06:31| and we know we're going to do it the correct way, the width, the length, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3991.0)|
| 1:06:35| So just making sure that, you know, we'll understand that subdivision comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3995.0)|
| 1:06:42| you're going to say it's going to cost half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4002.0)|
| 1:06:45| and the developer agrees to pay $300,000 of that $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4005.0)|
| 1:06:50| That's in cash to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4010.0)|
| 1:06:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4013.0)|
| 1:06:54| And typically those percentages would be based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4014.0)|
| 1:07:00| at least the way we would present it to this body at present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4020.0)|
| 1:07:04| would be based on traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4024.0)|
| 1:07:07| That's a traffic engineer that's licensed in the state that is hired by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4027.0)|
| 1:07:13| and he, under our review, sets aside background traffic and growth of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4033.0)|
| 1:07:20| and that way we can equitably split out what costs are the counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4040.0)|
| 1:07:25| and what costs are the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4045.0)|
| 1:07:28| I apologize for turning my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4048.0)|
| 1:07:30| We had this discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4050.0)|
| 1:07:35| So I'm a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4055.0)|
| 1:07:37| It may not be fair, but that's the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4057.0)|
| 1:07:40| I'm on a road, and I'm the developer, and I've got to pay to fix this road, this portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4060.0)|
| 1:07:45| Then the next two years later, there's another developer that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4065.0)|
| 1:07:49| and he didn't have to pay for this part of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4069.0)|
| 1:07:52| And I don't know if we can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4072.0)|
| 1:07:54| It's just too late to the party type deal, but they would still have to fix their section of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4074.0)|
| 1:07:59| But they got the benefit of not having to fix the whole road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4079.0)|
| 1:08:03| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4083.0)|
| 1:08:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4085.0)|
| 1:08:06| That cumulative effect of development is one of the things that really we don't have a tool that can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4086.0)|
| 1:08:13| If the developments come in simultaneously or while we're in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4093.0)|
| 1:08:17| we can reflect those agreements or modify them to reflect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4097.0)|
| 1:08:21| But to your point, if it comes in after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4101.0)|
| 1:08:24| then there's really no way or mechanism we have to require that additional participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4104.0)|
| 1:08:32| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4112.0)|
| 1:08:34| I talked to the home builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4114.0)|
| 1:08:36| The only question that they had was is the release going to be upon the receipt of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4116.0)|
| 1:08:44| or upon the completion because you're holding their land plots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4124.0)|
| 1:08:50| so they want to know as soon as they pay you, is that obligation then met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4130.0)|
| 1:08:54| rather than waiting for you to complete the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4134.0)|
| 1:08:56| Because in theory, what they're afraid of, you could drag your feet for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4136.0)|
| 1:09:00| and then they would never get their property released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4140.0)|
| 1:09:03| Could you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4143.0)|
| 1:09:05| Correct. Good question, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4145.0)|
| 1:09:07| Once they enter into the MOU or other mechanism as it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4147.0)|
| 1:09:12| their approvals would be released at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4152.0)|
| 1:09:17| We would also potentially do the staggering of reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4157.0)|
| 1:09:22| within the engineering phase and the construction phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4162.0)|
| 1:09:26| so that they don't have to pay everything up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4166.0)|
| 1:09:29| I think we could approve things on the front end as well as stagger the reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4169.0)|
| 1:09:35| Do we have that in some kind of detail to make sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4175.0)|
| 1:09:39| We're in this position originally because of writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4179.0)|
| 1:09:41| Do we have that in writing somewhere, or can we make sure it's in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4181.0)|
| 1:09:45| Yeah, I can work with Mr. Moyers and we can see if we can get that language added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4185.0)|
| 1:09:50| Because I want it as clear as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4190.0)|
| 1:09:56| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4196.0)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4197.0)|
| 1:09:58| Director Stone, I know there's been some discussion about Commissioner Ward's point there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4198.0)|
| 1:10:06| about completion of road improvements prior to permits being released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4206.0)|
| 1:10:14| If that's the case, would that condition need to be made either at the Planning Commission level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4214.0)|
| 1:10:21| or this Commission level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4221.0)|
| 1:10:23| Would that need to be read into the motion as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4223.0)|
| 1:10:26| that the project not only needs to be entered into an MOU and payments made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4226.0)|
| 1:10:31| but the improvements must be completed before permits are granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4231.0)|
| 1:10:37| Correct. And to Commissioner Daly's point, each case is going to be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4237.0)|
| 1:10:42| Typically, the traffic is based on the number of homes constructed and occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4242.0)|
| 1:10:48| so it may be a situation where we could allow the construction of homes to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4248.0)|
| 1:10:54| but hold COs until such time the need for the improvement was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4254.0)|
| 1:11:01| I think we can look at it a little bit different each time, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4261.0)|
| 1:11:05| There may have to be thresholds that are set by either Planning Commission or this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4265.0)|
| 1:11:10| to allow for the protection for the public such that a turn lane isn't not constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4270.0)|
| 1:11:16| by the time so many homes are constructed or occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4276.0)|
| 1:11:22| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4282.0)|
| 1:11:23| If that's the case, can we make sure that there is a time frame set in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4283.0)|
| 1:11:28| Because like I said earlier, for example's sake, you need $100,000 to build a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4288.0)|
| 1:11:36| In theory, if we make it that you guys will not release the plots until the turn lane is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4296.0)|
| 1:11:44| I'm not saying you'd ever do this, but you could hold up that construction forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4304.0)|
| 1:11:48| Or if there's another pandemic or whatever the case may be, a plane crashes into the, I don't know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4308.0)|

| 1:12:06| just to screw it to that builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4326.0)|
| 1:12:09| You need to have some kind of time frame mechanism in there, some reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4329.0)|
| 1:12:13| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4333.0)|
| 1:12:15| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4335.0)|
| 1:12:16| And certainly our goal is to be equitable both in the cost share as well as the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4336.0)|
| 1:12:21| so I can work with Mr. Moyers there and we can see if we can address some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4341.0)|
| 1:12:25| that would address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4345.0)|

| 1:15:27| So we are on to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4527.0)|
| 1:15:31| Item number 62, discussion of March agenda zoning items, numbers 64 through 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4531.0)|

| 1:15:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4540.0)|

| 1:16:01| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4561.0)|

| 1:16:13| I'd make a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4573.0)|
| 1:16:15| No, we're not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4575.0)|
| 1:16:16| We're just discussing if there's anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4576.0)|
| 1:16:18| Basically, if there's anything we need to consider before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4578.0)|
| 1:16:22| Any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4582.0)|
| 1:16:23| Just on 65 and 66, I have met with Mr. Graham on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4583.0)|
| 1:16:30| It is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4590.0)|
| 1:16:32| I think it will add to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4592.0)|
| 1:16:35| There's a subdivision behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4595.0)|
| 1:16:37| It will not affect them in any matter because they will be entering on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4597.0)|
| 1:16:41| So I think this will be good for District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4601.0)|
| 1:16:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4606.0)|
| 1:16:48| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4608.0)|
| 1:16:50| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4610.0)|
| 1:16:53| Mr. Moyers, you and I had a discussion about this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4613.0)|
| 1:16:56| If we're going to do this, I think we should probably notify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4616.0)|
| 1:16:59| If we're going to continue doing this at work sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4619.0)|
| 1:17:03| I think we should notify the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4623.0)|
| 1:17:06| That's certainly something we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4626.0)|
| 1:17:08| You and I had this discussion last time afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4628.0)|
| 1:17:11| The thing about it is, as I said before, we shouldn't be taking any votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4631.0)|
| 1:17:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4639.0)|
| 1:17:20| If you're going to open it up for people to speak on each item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4640.0)|
| 1:17:24| we're going to have to probably adjust the rules on how these work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4644.0)|
| 1:17:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4650.0)|
| 1:17:31| But as long as we're not voting on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4651.0)|
| 1:17:34| my understanding is we're just sort of getting input from the district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4654.0)|
| 1:17:40| But if you want people notified—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4660.0)|
| 1:17:43| I think in good faith we should have people notified in good action because really—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4663.0)|
| 1:17:53| I'll just say this the polite way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4673.0)|
| 1:17:57| The builder knows what his project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4677.0)|
| 1:17:59| and the people that oppose it in the area know what that area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4679.0)|
| 1:18:03| And we don't necessarily know all the facts and the figures once we get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4683.0)|
| 1:18:10| So there's a possibility for a commissioner to make an accusation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4690.0)|
| 1:18:15| without having the full knowledge of what the situation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4695.0)|
| 1:18:18| which then may persuade votes for the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4698.0)|
| 1:18:22| So I don't know if the practice is a good practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4702.0)|
| 1:18:26| If we're going to do it, you almost have to do a full meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4706.0)|
| 1:18:30| because we don't know what planning really thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4710.0)|
| 1:18:33| because they haven't given us their opinion on it and why their opinion is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4713.0)|
| 1:18:38| I have six people I talk to every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4718.0)|
| 1:18:42| six planning commissioners I talk to every single time before I come to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4722.0)|
| 1:18:46| I talk to all six of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4726.0)|
| 1:18:48| They all give me their different perspectives of why the votes went certain ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4728.0)|
| 1:18:51| and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4731.0)|
| 1:18:53| There's all this information and all this detail that we're not painting a full picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4733.0)|
| 1:18:59| I don't know if that's fair because these decisions affect people's lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4739.0)|
| 1:19:03| and their livelihoods and their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4743.0)|
| 1:19:06| I don't know if it's – I don't like trending this way because we've never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4746.0)|
| 1:19:12| I'm fine with doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4752.0)|
| 1:19:13| This is what commission wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4753.0)|
| 1:19:14| but I think we're going to do this out of respect to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4754.0)|
| 1:19:18| and the community that they should be able to be involved in this to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4758.0)|
| 1:19:23| It's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4763.0)|
| 1:19:25| I would say that, subject to being corrected because I'm not certain about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4765.0)|
| 1:19:29| I think it's the planning commission that notifies applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4769.0)|
| 1:19:33| and community members about zonings that are going to be on the county commission, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4773.0)|
| 1:19:40| So to do that, we would have to get the planning commission involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4780.0)|
| 1:19:43| in putting out signage as they do for the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4783.0)|
| 1:19:49| I don't think they go to everybody and knock on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4789.0)|
| 1:19:53| I think they put up signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4793.0)|
| 1:19:55| So we'll have to get them to do that at an earlier time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4795.0)|
| 1:19:58| This is a notified meeting, and traditionally, up until a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4798.0)|
| 1:20:02| we never did this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4802.0)|
| 1:20:04| and then we're not notifying the public that we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4804.0)|
| 1:20:07| or the property owner that we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4807.0)|
| 1:20:09| So I think it would be in good taste to let, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4809.0)|
| 1:20:16| some of these decisions are multimillion-dollar decisions that you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4816.0)|
| 1:20:19| without any input from the person that it's affecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4819.0)|
| 1:20:24| which is I think it's a dangerous road to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4824.0)|
| 1:20:28| Because I've already seen in the last two months a commissioner say one thing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4828.0)|
| 1:20:33| and then all of a sudden it's a different story once we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4833.0)|
| 1:20:36| So I feel like we're going to end up making a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4836.0)|
| 1:20:40| that's going to end up costing somebody their livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4840.0)|
| 1:20:43| or we make a bad decision because we have bad information to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4843.0)|
| 1:20:50| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4850.0)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4852.0)|
| 1:20:54| It is publicly noticed through our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4854.0)|
| 1:20:57| They know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4857.0)|
| 1:20:58| So it is publicly noticed, I guess, three weeks, two weeks before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4858.0)|
| 1:21:06| I like doing it for this simple reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4866.0)|
| 1:21:08| I cannot call you and tell you to go to look at that piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4868.0)|
| 1:21:14| I'll be breaking the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4874.0)|
| 1:21:16| No, you can tell me to go look at the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4876.0)|
| 1:21:18| As long as you don't tell me how to vote or how you're going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4878.0)|
| 1:21:21| I can go and you can say, Commissioner Ward, you should go check out this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4881.0)|
| 1:21:25| There's A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4885.0)|
| 1:21:28| It's a fine line, but as long as it doesn't go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4888.0)|
| 1:21:31| As long as it doesn't go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4891.0)|
| 1:21:32| It's exploratory information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4892.0)|
| 1:21:35| As long as you don't tell me how you're going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4895.0)|
| 1:21:37| and I don't tell you how I'm going to vote, you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4897.0)|
| 1:21:39| Kyle, go check this out, look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4899.0)|
| 1:21:43| I would rather do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4903.0)|
| 1:21:45| Sure, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4905.0)|
| 1:21:47| That's my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4907.0)|
| 1:21:49| I'm fine with doing it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4909.0)|
| 1:21:50| My thing is if we're going to do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4910.0)|
| 1:21:53| out of respect to the applicants that are coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4913.0)|
| 1:21:56| they should be involved in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4916.0)|
| 1:21:58| I feel like they have the opportunity to at least defend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4918.0)|
| 1:22:02| if we start going down the wrong path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4922.0)|
| 1:22:08| I appreciate that sentiment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4928.0)|
| 1:22:10| I'm trying to look out for the citizens is my point I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4930.0)|
| 1:22:16| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4936.0)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4937.0)|
| 1:22:20| Commissioner Ward, I always appreciate his insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4940.0)|
| 1:22:22| because he gives a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4942.0)|
| 1:22:26| The whole idea behind putting it on as a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4946.0)|
| 1:22:29| is this is a discussion item between the 11 county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4949.0)|
| 1:22:32| that serve on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4952.0)|
| 1:22:34| We would not be asking the public to come forward to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4954.0)|
| 1:22:38| to get their opinion on the different items on a discussion item like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4958.0)|
| 1:22:44| Nor would we be asking the developer to come to the podium and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4964.0)|
| 1:22:49| This is just, like Commissioner Daley said, for general information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4969.0)|
| 1:22:53| I want to know, do I need to go see that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4973.0)|
| 1:22:56| Do I need to look at the hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4976.0)|
| 1:22:58| Do I need to look at the traffic flow on XYZ Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4978.0)|
| 1:23:02| All we want is to be able to make an intelligent decision next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4982.0)|
| 1:23:06| and that was the whole premise of having a pre-meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4986.0)|
| 1:23:10| before our formal meeting just like we do with the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4990.0)|
| 1:23:14| We were advised by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4994.0)|
| 1:23:16| that we should not be pulling it off the agenda to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4996.0)|
| 1:23:20| that it would be a better avenue to put it as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5000.0)|
| 1:23:24| and so that's why I did it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5004.0)|
| 1:23:26| Again, I'd like to hear from the district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5006.0)|
| 1:23:30| what their opinion is on the zoning item in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5010.0)|
| 1:23:36| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5016.0)|
| 1:23:37| My point is if you at least let them know that we're going to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5017.0)|
| 1:23:42| and the owner of the property, not necessarily the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5022.0)|
| 1:23:44| but the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5024.0)|
| 1:23:46| the person that we're going to make a judgment on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5026.0)|
| 1:23:48| we're going through this, we can at least reference them if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5028.0)|
| 1:23:51| We don't need to let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5031.0)|
| 1:23:53| They don't have the privilege to speak necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5033.0)|
| 1:23:55| but if we're sitting here and a commissioner is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5035.0)|
| 1:23:58| well, they haven't talked to me yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5038.0)|
| 1:24:00| Well, if they're standing right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5040.0)|
| 1:24:01| if they've been notified to come the week before and the week of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5041.0)|
| 1:24:04| then we can at least get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5044.0)|
| 1:24:06| Or if they don't care, then they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5046.0)|
| 1:24:08| I don't see an issue of sending out a piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5048.0)|
| 1:24:13| to let them know we're talking about their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5053.0)|
| 1:24:15| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5055.0)|
| 1:24:16| I'm not saying don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5056.0)|
| 1:24:17| I'm just saying, hey, guys, we're going to talk about your stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5057.0)|
| 1:24:20| If you want to show up and listen, you can listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5060.0)|
| 1:24:23| And, hey, we might call on you to say, hey, I haven't heard from you yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5063.0)|
| 1:24:26| or, hey, I forgot what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5066.0)|
| 1:24:28| or you put some color to what I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5068.0)|
| 1:24:31| I don't see the issue of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5071.0)|
| 1:24:35| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5075.0)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5078.0)|
| 1:24:39| I think you both have very valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5079.0)|
| 1:24:46| We haven't heard from Planning Commission, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5086.0)|
| 1:24:50| although their recommendation is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5090.0)|
| 1:24:54| To notify someone, I also agree, is not a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5094.0)|
| 1:25:02| I'm thinking the concern might come is that when we are talking about this from our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5102.0)|
| 1:25:09| sometimes we tend to say, oh, and I think this is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5109.0)|
| 1:25:15| or, man, I think this is a really bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5115.0)|
| 1:25:19| That's where I think it got a little bit uncertain, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5119.0)|
| 1:25:28| However, I will agree with Commissioner Ward that, I mean, sometimes we are pretty blind on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5128.0)|
| 1:25:37| I mean, in full disclosure, probably none of us has time to go out and drive around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5137.0)|
| 1:25:42| and look at, you know, 25 properties every month, necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5142.0)|
| 1:25:47| so we do have to rely heavily on presentations that are brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5147.0)|
| 1:25:52| and it would, in fact, give a builder or anyone in opposition to it a chance to know who they need to call up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5152.0)|
| 1:26:02| in the next week to say, you know, you might have gotten some wrong information or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5162.0)|
| 1:26:10| So I just say that to say I do clearly see both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5170.0)|
| 1:26:17| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5177.0)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5179.0)|
| 1:26:21| Yeah, I'm with Commissioner Hill on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5181.0)|
| 1:26:25| I see both points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5185.0)|
| 1:26:27| Would there be anything wrong, kind of like Commissioner Ward suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5187.0)|
| 1:26:31| would there be anything wrong with the Chairwoman Durrett just asking planning to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5191.0)|
| 1:26:36| as part of their procedure, notifying applicants that this item will appear on next month's County Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5196.0)|
| 1:26:46| and may also be discussed at their work session, just so that they would specifically be informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5206.0)|
| 1:26:54| hey, your zoning item could come up for discussion at the work session in case you wanted to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5214.0)|
| 1:27:01| It's not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5221.0)|
| 1:27:03| We're not going to be taking input from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5223.0)|
| 1:27:07| Ms. Brooks may have some thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5227.0)|
| 1:27:10| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5230.0)|
| 1:27:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5231.0)|
| 1:27:12| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5232.0)|
| 1:27:14| We would be happy to ask Dory Caron, who actually sends out the notices to applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5234.0)|
| 1:27:20| to add that additional language to the notice that goes, if you all would like for them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5240.0)|
| 1:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5246.0)|
| 1:27:27| I have no issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5247.0)|
| 1:27:30| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5250.0)|
| 1:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5251.0)|
| 1:27:32| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5252.0)|
| 1:27:33| Like I said, for me, it's just a question of logistics, but if they can take care of it, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5253.0)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5257.0)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5258.0)|
| 1:27:40| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5260.0)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5262.0)|
| 1:27:43| Again, really great points by my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5263.0)|
| 1:27:47| Seeing both sides of this, having kind of been in this arena for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5267.0)|
| 1:27:53| I think it's safe to say that anybody who's in the business of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5273.0)|
| 1:27:58| they know for a hot minute that this comes before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5278.0)|
| 1:28:03| I think the difference is we're now having very meaningful and intentional conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5283.0)|
| 1:28:10| about where we want to be and how we want to move forward when it comes to growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5290.0)|
| 1:28:18| I'm also concerned with the requirement of staff to be here to answer questions, should we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5298.0)|
| 1:28:25| There's that to take into consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5305.0)|
| 1:28:29| And I know that this has been an ongoing discussion about where can we have meaningful discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5309.0)|
| 1:28:37| It's about what's the best way to do that, and we're kind of just chasing our tails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5317.0)|
| 1:28:42| I think Commissioner Schoonmaker has tried to have pre-agenda discussion meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5322.0)|
| 1:28:48| We've tried to discuss it here at work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5328.0)|
| 1:28:52| I'm just really frustrated with this because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5332.0)|
| 1:28:56| I'm hearing from constituents that they're really glad that we're having this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5336.0)|
| 1:29:02| even if they're just tuning in and listening or they're going back and watching it on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5342.0)|
| 1:29:06| So, again, if you live in this world, you know the process and you know the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5346.0)|
| 1:29:15| And I think that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5355.0)|
| 1:29:22| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5362.0)|
| 1:29:24| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5364.0)|
| 1:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5370.0)|
| 1:29:32| We are at 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5372.0)|
| 1:29:40| 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5380.0)|
| 1:29:42| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5382.0)|
| 1:29:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5385.0)|
| 1:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5387.0)|
| 1:29:48| So before you get started, so to kind of go into this, do we, if we're not voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5388.0)|
| 1:29:55| do we need to have the clerk read it into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5395.0)|
| 1:29:58| Let's just discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5398.0)|
| 1:30:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5400.0)|
| 1:30:02| Probably easier to just go to the commissioners who have the thing and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5402.0)|
| 1:30:06| okay, you're up, you're up, you're up, and then we're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5406.0)|
| 1:30:11| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5411.0)|
| 1:30:12| I'm up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5412.0)|
| 1:30:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5413.0)|
| 1:30:14| 67 and 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5414.0)|
| 1:30:19| This is a property that's somewhat adjacent to the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5419.0)|
| 1:30:23| It's across the road and down the street a ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5423.0)|
| 1:30:30| My comments on this would be, when I came on commission a little over four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5430.0)|
| 1:30:37| the Midway Business Park had already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5437.0)|
| 1:30:40| Since that time, all the infrastructure's been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5440.0)|
| 1:30:45| I think we had a ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5445.0)|
| 1:30:46| I know we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5446.0)|
| 1:30:47| We had a ceremonial ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5447.0)|
| 1:30:49| To date, there are no tenants in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5449.0)|
| 1:30:53| There were several agreements, handshakes, commitments, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5453.0)|
| 1:30:57| made to the Thorn Grove community regarding commercial development outside the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5457.0)|
| 1:31:06| Some of those are in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5466.0)|
| 1:31:08| Some of those are not in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5468.0)|
| 1:31:09| Some of those were simply promises made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5469.0)|
| 1:31:13| I think the best expression of them is probably in the small area plan for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5473.0)|
| 1:31:19| But the long and short of it is, this does not fit those commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5479.0)|
| 1:31:25| So, that's how I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5485.0)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5492.0)|
| 1:31:34| Commissioner Lee for item number 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5494.0)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you, Madam Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5498.0)|
| 1:31:42| I have not heard any opposition from my district on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5502.0)|
| 1:31:46| I think it would be consistent with the Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5506.0)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5514.0)|
| 1:31:56| And then, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5516.0)|
| 1:31:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5518.0)|
| 1:32:00| This is the Karate Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5520.0)|
| 1:32:02| Still trying to work out some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5522.0)|
| 1:32:04| I don't know if they've been worked out yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5524.0)|
| 1:32:07| This is the one that should have been transition zone in the first place, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5527.0)|
| 1:32:13| So, they went back to transition zone, and it did pass planning as a transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5533.0)|
| 1:32:21| So, we'll know if they've got it all worked out next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5541.0)|
| 1:32:27| I mean, it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5547.0)|
| 1:32:29| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5549.0)|
| 1:32:30| There's an issue that's got to be fixed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5550.0)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5554.0)|
| 1:32:36| And it's not a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5556.0)|
| 1:32:38| It's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5558.0)|
| 1:32:42| Next discussion item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5562.0)|
| 1:32:47| Item number 63, discussion item to change the zoning agenda to reflect the actual recommendation from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5567.0)|
| 1:32:56| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5576.0)|
| 1:32:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5578.0)|
| 1:33:01| This has kind of been ongoing, I guess, since I first became a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5581.0)|
| 1:33:06| I've always thought it was very odd that our printed agenda states one thing, and then we defer to NOx Planning, and they state something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5586.0)|
| 1:33:18| What I'm getting at is the way our agenda reads, and I'll just use this as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5598.0)|
| 1:33:24| For a zoning issue, it might say the applicant, Bob Jones, is requesting approval for residential development on XYZ Street, and he's requesting five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5604.0)|
| 1:33:42| I'm using just a generic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5622.0)|
| 1:33:46| But then we defer to NOx Planning, and they go, Bob Jones, XYZ Street, Planning Commission approved three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5626.0)|
| 1:33:59| So my contention is, why shouldn't the agenda reflect what the Planning Commission's recommendation to us, what the Planning Commissioners voted on on that particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5639.0)|
| 1:34:13| Because it's very confusing to the public when they're looking at our agenda, and it says, oh my gosh, five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5653.0)|
| 1:34:20| when in fact the real recommendation, not from the Planning staff, but from the Planning Commissioners, have said three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5660.0)|
| 1:34:30| So why don't we actually put what the recommendation is from Planning Commission posted on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5670.0)|
| 1:34:38| And it's easily done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5678.0)|
| 1:34:40| It is. 64 says Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5680.0)|
| 1:34:46| Okay, did she move those over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5686.0)|
| 1:34:50| 66 says Planning Commission recommendation, approve PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5690.0)|
| 1:34:55| Okay, let me use a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5695.0)|
| 1:34:58| 67, Planning Commission action, approve the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5698.0)|
| 1:35:04| 68, approve EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5704.0)|
| 1:35:09| I know this was something we discussed at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5709.0)|
| 1:35:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5712.0)|
| 1:35:13| That we were going to ask Planning to include both the staff recommendation and then the Planning Commission recommendation as well in the captions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5713.0)|
| 1:35:26| And I think we discussed that before Mr. Moyers joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5726.0)|
| 1:35:32| I mean, this was years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5732.0)|
| 1:35:34| We talked about you can always ask, I mean, you can see in the case file what the staff started with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5734.0)|
| 1:35:40| but at the end of the day there's only two governing bodies, them and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5740.0)|
| 1:35:44| So with all due respect to the staff, it's the recommendation coming from the other legislative body to us is really the one that matters the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5744.0)|
| 1:35:53| That's what the statute says, that you have to get the Planning Commission's recommendation before you act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5753.0)|
| 1:35:58| Now you can take whatever information you like, including staff recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5758.0)|
| 1:36:02| but the one that you have to have is the Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5762.0)|
| 1:36:07| So I'm confused, Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5767.0)|
| 1:36:09| Okay, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5769.0)|
| 1:36:17| Okay, let's go look at your agenda for item 2A23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5777.0)|
| 1:36:24| Let me make sure that that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5784.0)|
| 1:36:26| Somebody sent me a mock-up of what we were doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5786.0)|
| 1:36:31| Is it what's attached to the agenda packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5791.0)|
| 1:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5803.0)|
| 1:36:45| What she did, okay, if you look at 2A23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5805.0)|
| 1:36:53| Okay, that would be it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5813.0)|
| 1:36:56| Yes, what she's saying we could do, they could put, and I'll just read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5816.0)|
| 1:37:01| Planning Commission action, approve the Northwest City Sector Plan Amendment to CC Community Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5821.0)|
| 1:37:08| because it's a logical extension of the development pattern by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5828.0)|
| 1:37:14| Then she goes in and lists the property address and that the applicant is listed at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5834.0)|
| 1:37:20| It says Graham Corporation Applicant, Commission District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5840.0)|
| 1:37:27| Is that a little bit easier to understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5847.0)|
| 1:37:29| So you're basically taking out the applicant's request and only including Planning Commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5849.0)|
| 1:37:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5858.0)|
| 1:37:39| That's it because it doesn't really matter what the applicant's requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5859.0)|
| 1:37:42| It's what they've all, the Planning Commission has actually presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5862.0)|
| 1:37:50| Respectfully, Commissioner, that's really not, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5870.0)|
| 1:37:55| What I'm saying is that at the end of the day it is still the request of the applicant that you're acting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5875.0)|
| 1:38:02| You're getting a recommendation from the Planning Commission, but that is not binding on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5882.0)|
| 1:38:07| And if you leave out or minimize what the applicant's asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5887.0)|
| 1:38:12| then you're basically elevating the Planning Commission over the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5892.0)|
| 1:38:18| I mean, this is a legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5898.0)|
| 1:38:22| All that this body's required to do in amending the zoning ordinance is get the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5902.0)|
| 1:38:29| After that, this commission can do what it likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5909.0)|
| 1:38:34| But I think it's a bit of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5914.0)|
| 1:38:37| Like on the first one, this is the request of Robert T. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5917.0)|
| 1:38:40| It's not the Planning Commission's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5920.0)|
| 1:38:42| It's Mr. Whitehead's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5922.0)|
| 1:38:44| Now he may, this commission may be inclined to give him what he wants or it might not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5924.0)|
| 1:38:49| but at the end of the day it's still his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5929.0)|
| 1:38:51| It's not the Planning Commission's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5931.0)|
| 1:38:53| So respectfully, I think that would be a problem to just list or even primarily list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5933.0)|
| 1:39:01| the Planning Commission's recommendation over that, what the property owner's actually asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5941.0)|
| 1:39:10| Okay, that's one of the good reasons why we have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5950.0)|
| 1:39:15| See?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5955.0)|
| 1:39:19| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5959.0)|
| 1:39:20| Just a quick question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5960.0)|
| 1:39:22| Can we include the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5962.0)|
| 1:39:25| Because I do feel like that's important information in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5965.0)|
| 1:39:30| From a legal point of view, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5970.0)|
| 1:39:32| Just, you know, these captions are going to get pretty long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5972.0)|
| 1:39:35| But there's nothing legally wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5975.0)|
| 1:39:41| So to move forward with this, if we wanted to get their caption on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5981.0)|
| 1:39:48| can we just do that administratively through the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5988.0)|
| 1:39:55| Director Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5995.0)|
| 1:39:59| Who drafts these captions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5999.0)|
| 1:40:03| Is it Drew or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6003.0)|
| 1:40:04| The law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6004.0)|
| 1:40:05| Dory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6005.0)|
| 1:40:06| Dory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6006.0)|
| 1:40:07| Yeah, I guess if you just ask Dory to include the planning staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6007.0)|
| 1:40:10| she'd be happy to do it, I imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6010.0)|
| 1:40:13| Is that the consensus of the body to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6013.0)|
| 1:40:18| Amy, do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6018.0)|
| 1:40:19| I just have a question if it's okay to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6019.0)|
| 1:40:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6022.0)|
| 1:40:23| So if we were to add staff's recommendation, would that also be read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6023.0)|
| 1:40:33| She still does it because it's still read into the record anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6033.0)|
| 1:40:38| The clerk still reads it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6038.0)|
| 1:40:40| But, yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6040.0)|
| 1:40:43| It would be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6043.0)|
| 1:40:50| Actually, she just corrected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6050.0)|
| 1:40:52| The clerk doesn't read the planning commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6052.0)|
| 1:40:57| That's left up to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6057.0)|
| 1:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6060.0)|
| 1:41:01| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6061.0)|
| 1:41:02| But it would be publicized in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6062.0)|
| 1:41:07| It would be written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6067.0)|
| 1:41:08| Yeah, and I would say that it is part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6068.0)|
| 1:41:11| Staff's recommendation is included already in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6071.0)|
| 1:41:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6074.0)|
| 1:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6075.0)|
| 1:41:16| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6076.0)|
| 1:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6077.0)|
| 1:41:18| Amy and I have had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6078.0)|
| 1:41:19| I believe it's in our rules that it comes down, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6079.0)|
| 1:41:24| and that's what Amy has to read or just reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6084.0)|
| 1:41:28| That could be done by the clerk all at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6088.0)|
| 1:41:32| and we don't have to ask Amy what staff recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6092.0)|
| 1:41:37| because it's already read into the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6097.0)|
| 1:41:40| More important to me is Amy or Michelle or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6100.0)|
| 1:41:45| when I asked a question, what happened, why did they vote 8-6 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6105.0)|
| 1:41:53| that you really know why it was 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6113.0)|
| 1:41:56| That's more important than reading, having Amy or whoever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6116.0)|
| 1:42:02| Michelle, I guess, now read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6122.0)|
| 1:42:05| You follow what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6125.0)|
| 1:42:07| Well, just let the clerk read the whole thing into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6127.0)|
| 1:42:10| and we've got that solved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6130.0)|
| 1:42:12| and then hopefully when I asked Michelle, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6132.0)|
| 1:42:16| did you all discuss commercial when he really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6136.0)|
| 1:42:20| that would be a better fit than GC or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6140.0)|
| 1:42:25| We'll be good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6145.0)|
| 1:42:28| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6148.0)|
| 1:42:34| So what is the, what are, we've had several recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6154.0)|
| 1:42:38| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6158.0)|
| 1:42:39| I would have the clerk read the whole thing into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6159.0)|
| 1:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6165.0)|
| 1:42:46| Since it is currently in our rules that Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6166.0)|
| 1:42:50| Staff Reports, Planning Commission's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6170.0)|
| 1:42:52| that would have to be a rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6172.0)|
| 1:42:56| That's what we're waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6176.0)|
| 1:42:58| We have a couple of other things on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6178.0)|
| 1:43:01| Let's change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6181.0)|
| 1:43:04| Hear, hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6184.0)|
| 1:43:08| Is there any more discussion regarding this discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6188.0)|
| 1:43:25| Is there any more business to come before this work session of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6205.0)|
| 1:43:29| Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6209.0)|
| 1:43:31| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6211.0)|
| 1:43:32| Just want to remind everyone that we have an educational series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6212.0)|

| 1:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6224.0)|
| 1:43:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6226.0)|
| 1:43:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6228.0)|
| 1:43:49| You had noticed there's some bass boats coming into town for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6229.0)|
| 1:43:53| tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6233.0)|
| 1:43:54| so it's kind of neat to see those turning in on to Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6234.0)|
| 1:43:57| this afternoon on the way to audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6237.0)|
| 1:44:00| So I'm glad they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6240.0)|
| 1:44:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6243.0)|
| 1:44:05| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6245.0)|
| 1:44:06| Guess what I'm going to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6246.0)|
| 1:44:09| April 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6249.0)|
