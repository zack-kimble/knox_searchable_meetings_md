| 2:44:35| My eight-year-old daughter, who just finished third grade, hears about drugs at elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9875)|
| 2:44:42| And, of course, we as parents know it's never too early to start talking to children about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9882)|
| 2:44:51| But sometimes I think that what they get in school that mom and dad aren't telling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:58| but when they hear it from an authority figure at school, sometimes that carries more weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| So I would very much like to see you all developing a curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| or a program to be used with children as young as kindergartners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| Well, this is more important now that we don't have the DARE program like we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:17| See, they were in the elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| Yeah, I just want to point out, and I just forwarded you guys all the e-mail from the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| we've got $11,500 in fines that haven't been collected since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| And I'm going to get with the law department over the next couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| and hopefully can figure out what we need to do to recover these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| And some of these businesses shouldn't still be in business, but we'll work on collecting these fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:49| But that's $11,500 if we can collect all these fines that are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| And we need to make sure this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| The motion before us is the amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| Everybody knows what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9972)|

| 2:46:16| Page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| and prior to the Knox County Law Director's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| on the county commission's behalf, Section 15 of the amended and restated lease agreement between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| and Hillcrest Health Care, dated March 24, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| by putting Hillcrest Health Care on notice for material breach of the agreement for cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| in accordance with the requirements of said section of the agreement, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:44| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:45| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| Eight on no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| Bottom line, Mr. Law Director, what exactly does this do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| What are we saying here with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| If you were to proceed with the resolution as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| you would essentially be putting Hillcrest on notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| and ultimately essentially ceasing any operation or their ability to maintain our premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10024)|
| 2:47:11| So it's basically it would terminate the contract with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Hillcrest folks are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Why should we not do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| I need your name, address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| William Mason, 3560 Talahi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| I'm the chair of the Hillcrest Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| We asked the commission not to adopt the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| We were here in February and March of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:40| and asked that the item be deferred so that we would have time to complete the Medicaid recertification survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:50| and to cure any alleged breach of that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| Hillcrest West successfully passed a full Medicaid recertification survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10076)|
| 2:48:03| and was readmitted to the Medicaid program in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| The survey at West was conducted by the leader of the team from the Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10089)|
| 2:48:18| was the same person who conducted the survey in January that led to our decertification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:27| In addition, at South, since I reported to you last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10107)|
| 2:48:35| that facility has completed its annual survey with four low-level deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:44| and as a result of that positive survey and South's strong compliance history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| with the requirements for a nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:57| the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have raised South's star rating from two stars to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10137)|
| 2:49:06| I think that Hillcrest is a much different and much improved organization than it was two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10146)|
| 2:49:15| when we first appeared with the help of Grace Healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:21| the professional organization that we've employed to provide the day-to-day operations of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10161)|
| 2:49:31| We have clinical and financial systems in place that are designed and working to support our mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10171)|
| 2:49:39| to consistently and properly care for the senior residents of Knox County who are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:50| We appreciate the Commission's patience over the last two years in allowing the Board to get its arms around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10190)|
| 2:49:59| and to have time to respond to both the clinical and financial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| I think the efforts that have been made in both areas are now paying dividends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| and we expect further gains at all facilities from the foundation that's been laid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10210)|
| 2:50:19| For those reasons, we ask that the resolution not be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10228)|
| 2:50:29| Bill, I believe the reason we granted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| we were trying to get a healthcare open back up as fast as we could down there at Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| and you all said you all could get certified faster than anyone else could as we went along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| But the only thing I want to talk about, and I'm not going to be here after another month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| the only thing I want to say is, you know, I told everybody this was coming in 08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| but I think that we passed a resolution that someone from Hillcrest was supposed to be up here once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10248)|
| 2:50:57| I would like to go back to the quarter on that and not get a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10257)|
| 2:51:01| but have someone come up and stand at that podium where these commissioners could ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| about how things are going, if that's not too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| That's all I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| And I want to thank you for getting it recertified and I certainly hope they do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| A couple questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| You mentioned Hillcrest South's three-star rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| Hillcrest North is still, at Medicare.gov, rated one star out of five, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| North is currently awaiting their annual service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| And its current online for health inspection is one star out of five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| And its nursing home staffing rating is one star out of five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:45| If you'll take my word for it, I'm looking at the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Does Hillcrest still have in Michigan a facility that is an SSS, special focus facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:57| Hillcrest has no facilities other than in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| Does Grace have in Michigan a facility that's still SFF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| Trent Talbert, the president of Grace Healthcare, is here this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| If you don't mind, we'll let him answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| Is that facility in Michigan still SFF, special focus facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| I guess I've introduced myself right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| Trent Talbert from Grace Healthcare in Chattanooga, president of Grace Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:28| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| As you know, that star rating process is a three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:36| The building has had two surveys with three or less deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| and should be off that list after the next survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| Well, let's hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| Let's talk about Grace also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Grace Healthcare of Benton, which is in Arkansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| In 2007, rather than agreeing to something by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| did you challenge them before an administrative law judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| And did you lose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| No, we won that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| I point you to the decision, October 20, 2007, docket number C06610,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| that they determined that the civil monetary penalties of $3,500 a day against you were appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10397)|
| 2:53:25| and that you would lose nurse aid competency evaluation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| To my knowledge, the only thing we went all the way through to ALJ was a survey at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10412)|
| 2:53:38| of that facility's experience that resulted in several immediate jeopardy tags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10418)|
| 2:53:46| and we did ultimately win that through the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| Well, I'm not talking about you appealing the fine and losing that appeal, not the item itself, but the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10430)|
| 2:54:00| and you also lost nurse aid competency and evaluation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10443)|
| 2:54:04| Yeah, during a period of time in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:07| So your cooperation with Medicare is spotty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| I would like to say that I appreciate what you've gotten done the last three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:30| As I mentioned when we sat here in March, why you waited so long to get behind the eight ball and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10470)|
| 2:54:40| I just hope, assuming that, you know, we defeat this today and you go on in this endeavor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:49| that we don't have to go back through this again because I'm going to be one of the ones going to be setting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10489)|
| 2:54:53| I'm not going to be gone in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| And I just want you to know that we will be keeping an eye on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| and I agree with Commissioner Pinkston that at least once a quarter we should have a progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:09| And anything that comes up in between, I mean, all it takes is a letter to our commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| and it's put out to the rest of us as far as what is going on, good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10514)|
| 2:55:19| because we have a responsibility to the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| that can't take care of themselves, to see that this is done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| And I just want, again, putting it on notice that we are going to be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:35| How often do they come and do these inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Once every six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| Yes, at West, the normal cycle is once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| Once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| And at West, once every six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| Well, we're in the recertification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| We've applied to be recertified for Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:58| The first step was to be recertified for Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10558)|
| 2:56:02| We had that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| We don't know, of course, when that survey will occur, but we're due for another survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| So right now you don't have Medicare and Medicaid there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| We have Medicaid, not Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:17| That's the process having been decertified to go back and apply for first Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10577)|
| 2:56:25| and then apply for Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| So it takes one more inspection pass to get the Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| It's due, but they don't tell you when they're coming, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:43| What would be wrong, Commissioners, if we got copies of these reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:48| when they were done by the inspectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| I think we should have them immediately after they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| Is that a problem with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| I would like to request that if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| When we get the survey results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| we normally have a period of ten days to respond to those results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| and develop a plan of correction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| and I'd recommend that we give you those with the plan of correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| It would be a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Do we have a motion on the floor at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10653)|
| 2:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| You know, this was a really close vote when this came up last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| and it was a very, very narrow vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| and I think this commission took a gamble on you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:48| and I think that gamble has paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| I understand Rome wasn't built in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| and I'm not concerned about what goes on throughout the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:59| I'm concerned about what goes on at Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| and I think you all inherited a very difficult situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| I think you've made the best of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| and I think you're slowly turning this place around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| So at this time, I don't see any reason to put you on notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| so I'm going to ask that we vote against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| and we not put Hillcrest on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| Keep in mind that this commission will be looking over your shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| and any other commissioner, I'll be gone in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| but any other commissioner can put this back on at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| But at this time, I think you all have made significant progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:36| so I'm going to make the motion that we vote against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| So the motion would be to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10722)|
| 2:58:43| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| Well, we've got to have a second before we have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| Now we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| You said you wanted to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| First of all, I feel like commission didn't do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| This would have been corrected in 2008 when this first came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| if we had done our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| We let it linger on too far until they got close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| I would like to make a motion that they have to be here every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| for us to talk to or for you to talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| and that they give us that report, like the gentleman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| ten days I believe it was after that or something, give us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| And if they fall down any of these reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| if they're down to a one star, that they at least be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10761)|
| 2:59:29| I was going to say, Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| I would accept the first part of that as a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10771)|
| 2:59:35| that they come to us every so many days to let us know how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| But, you know, I think that it's to set in motion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| there is a process set in place to terminate this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| And I think to set a condition that would automatically pull the trigger on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| without any regard to the circumstances surrounding it would be irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| So if you would take that last part off, asking them to come back every few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| I would accept that as a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| but I just can't accept any automatic triggers that would terminate this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| Let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Serene Manor corrected their problems over there in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| Let's put it these problems need to be corrected in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Now, we're giving these people a break on their tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| I want this health care unit open down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| We need it in Knoxville Bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| But they need to do something to correct these deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| They don't need to let them drag out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| Now, Serene Manor was a FSC facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:38| They corrected theirs in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| and these people didn't get them corrected in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| Mr. Pinkston, that's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| Based on the rules, a facility, once they're on the special focus list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| is going to be on that list at least a year or even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| There's no way to correct the focus list within a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| I bought up this Medicare.gov you go on, and when I looked at it and they were on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| they corrected theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| They were out there in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| Now, theirs may not have been as bad as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| I'm not saying that, but we need to be sure that you're going to give the citizens of Knox County good care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| because you're getting a free ride down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| The focus list, the star rating, and deficiencies are all separate entities and are different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:39| We had a building that was on the special focus list that we purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| and within three months it became a four-star building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| which to this day anyone we talk to in the business says that that's an impossibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| There are all sorts of studies out there that the star rating has a lot of issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10914)|
| 3:02:02| The most recent one is over 1,000 nursing homes were surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| and the customer relations surveys were in direct opposite of the star rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:14| The one-star buildings had higher customer ratings and the five-star buildings had lower customer ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| So the star list is a very difficult thing to rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| Commissioner Pinkston, before we go any further, you asked for a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| I'm going to ask if we have the do we have a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10947)|
| 3:02:33| Would you restate it, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| Well, I was wanting to ask him another question because I might change that substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10956)|
| 3:02:40| Let me ask you this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| When they come in and grade you, how soon do they give you your rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| Normally we find out about the rating by getting on the computer and looking at the special focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| How long does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| You don't get notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Normally it takes-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10978)|
| 3:02:59| If they checked you today, how long would it be before you knew what rating they were giving you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| It would be three to six months before we know, before the rating gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:09| With the south survey, the three-star rating was not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10989)|
| 3:03:14| right after survey there wasn't any kind of immediate tick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| Well, you've agreed to come up here as soon as you get that rating and tell what you're doing to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:24| So Commissioner Pinkston's motion still includes the language of the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:30| Mr. Pinkston, do you still have your substitute motion out there to be seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11010)|
| 3:03:35| You want to know what it was, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:36| I want to know what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11016)|
| 3:03:37| I might very well second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11017)|
| 3:03:38| Mine was that we reinstate this, but have them to come forward every quarter at this podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11018)|
| 3:03:47| tell us how they think things are going, where you can ask them questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| give us that report as soon as they can where their judge checked every year to what their rating is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| and if they go down to a one-star rating, that you look at terminating their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11043)|
| 3:04:04| I'm willing to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11044)|
| 3:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| Could you please go over those ratings again that you had, south, north and west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| Give us those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| North and west are both one-stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| And south is now a three-star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11064)|
| 3:04:25| From a two to a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| And those stars, again, north, with the perfect survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| north's opportunity would be to move from a one-star to potentially a three-star,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| but that's as far as they'd be able to move after one survey period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| And that, again, is based on three-year history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| So there's a lot of history we have to overcome in order to move those ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| So what's the best that west can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| Currently, three was as good as west could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| They only had a three-deficiency survey, so they had an extremely good survey this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11097)|
| 3:05:03| You know, commissioners, my concern, you know, I'm not expertise in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| I'd like for Dr. Briggs to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| You know, I just feel uncomfortable that, you know, north is one, west is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:15| And where we are, we want the best for our seniors that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| Dr. Briggs, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| I want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| You know, I have a lot of, you know, mixed feelings about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| and I believe I actually voted against this the last time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| But, you know, I will have to say, you know, we know this from our joint commission examinations of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11133)|
| 3:05:39| and also, as you know, both Mercy and some of the other hospitals have their transitional care units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| which are classified as nursing homes, and they're in that five-star rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:49| And they almost always get five stars, but there certainly is a difference between a facility like Hillcrest West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11149)|
| 3:05:57| and St. Mary's where they just take a wing of the third floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| and you have nursing staff, laboratories, physical therapy, occupational therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| plus every physician of every specialty that you can imagine literally 30 seconds away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:13| So I think there are some problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| and what you're also saying is that sometimes different agencies can rate places differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:19| and I'll just give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| If you drive down the interstate here, you'll find out that Knoxville has about seven top 100 hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| I don't know if there's any more left in the country, but it just sort of depends on how they're rated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| I agree with Commissioner Pinkston completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| I think it would be good for Hillcrest to come back since we have had some of these controversies every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| and give us a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| If I understood, your last part of this was if there is a one-star rating we would give consideration to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:52| but not mandatory because I think there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| Right. That's correct, Commissioner Briggs, because let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| I may be wrong and I stand to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| I haven't looked at this lately, but two stars, I believe, is much below average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| Two stars is right below average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| Much below average, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| But anyway, and Commissioner Briggs, going back to what you're saying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| is Breakville Nursing Home operates the same way as Hillcrest does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11236)|
| 3:07:21| Now, this is all from my memory because I'm not looking at anything on Medicare.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| They are a four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11245)|
| 3:07:29| They operate the same facilities like they do, and they're a four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| We have several of them in a 22-mile radius around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| I checked them, 22-mile that are fours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Now, I want these people to succeed, but if we don't make them work hard at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:44| they're not going to succeed and we're giving them a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:46| I want them to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| I really wasn't planning on saying anything about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| I was planning on it, but I get worked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| But I want the citizens of Knoxville because we're paying these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| These people are non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11277)|
| 3:08:01| Breakville is a profit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| They take Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| Under state law, any nursing home that gets a license, is that not correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| They have to take Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| They can't jump over anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| You can apply for those and you can opt in or out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| Yeah, but if you're in Medicaid and Medicare, you have to get a nursing home license in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| You have to take so much, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11303)|
| 3:08:24| No, you can be a private pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Right, private pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| I'm talking about if you take them, though, you're operated and graded the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| Now, they make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| Others make money, and yet they're four stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| One thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| And they pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| Does Hillcrest pay any taxes, property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| One thing to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| This year, we really weight heavily the American Health Care Quality Awards in our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11329)|
| 3:08:56| They're based on Malcolm Baldrige Excellence Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11336)|
| 3:09:01| This year, there were nine centers that received the first level quality in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11341)|
| 3:09:07| Out of that nine, seven of them were Grace Health Care buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| That was the only nine in the whole state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| Hillcrest South was one of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| So, you know, we're very proud of our records in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11357)|
| 3:09:22| So I have no problem with you setting the bar high on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| Paul, here's what I was getting with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| To me, this is the third time we've brought this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| This is the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| To me, this is the third strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| And their flagship is right there in Commissioner Cairns, right there in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| probably with your most employees and most patients probably at North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| And I don't want to do anything to hurt those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| But, you know, Dr. Briggs, I guess what I'm getting at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| are we comfortable as a commission letting this go as a one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| Or do we owe it to our seniors and the people that are there in these nursing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| to get them somebody that will give them three or four care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| You know, to me, it seems like we're settling for this the least of the least we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| And we've given them time after time after time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| And, you know, just how long are our seniors going to wait for them to get their act together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:24| I mean, I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| And, again, for our purposes, Grace Healthcare purposes, the building was a one-star when we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:32| I mean, we have had less than a year to start moving those stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11432)|
| 3:10:37| And we're moving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| So what we're saying is we think we've got our act together with the Hillcrest team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:44| We have made major progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| We got this building certified quicker than anybody ever has in the whole state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:51| No one that I have spoken with believes we got this building re-certified as quickly as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| And we did because we have a great reputation in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| We work well with the surveyors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| And we're on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| So what we don't want to do, continue to do, is come down here and the wheels come off with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| and not be able to make these buildings continue to progress like they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| North is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11474)|
| 3:11:15| And south is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| And west will be full if we don't continue to talk about it in public and ruin its reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11478)|
| 3:11:25| Larry, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| Here's what we've done as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| I'm talking to Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| Larry, here's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| We've put ourselves in a bottle by not asking this to be corrected in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| Now we're in a position, we've delayed it up until right now about getting re-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:43| And these gentlemen here will be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| If we take this away from them, it's liable to be up to two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| before we can get someone else down there re-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| So we need to put these people on notice, keep their feet to the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| and say we're expecting you to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| That's what I'm trying to do, put some guidelines in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| And then if they don't, we need to take it from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| Well, I thought that's what we were doing today, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| I mean, to me, in my mind, I was coming to this meeting today, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| you've had three times at bat and you've struck out three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| So, you know, I wouldn't prepare to vote for this in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:14| You know, but if other people feel that we can, you know, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:18| But that's what I'm here to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| They say they're certified now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| And I think, you know, I'm looking at the citizens of Knoxville, that's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11542)|
| 3:12:27| They say they're certified, so we need to give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| When they come up here in the quarter and a year, if they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| you need to find someone else to take this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| And I think that's being fair with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11554)|
| 3:12:36| Do you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| Commissioner Smith, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| Well, you know, and, Paul, you're probably getting the same thing I'm getting in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11559)|
| 3:12:42| Michelle, you're probably getting the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| People say, don't take our seniors away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11564)|
| 3:12:47| Several months ago, that was one of the number one topics, especially in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| And it's like, guys, you're still not performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| and we as commissioners let you still non-perform and take care of our adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11575)|
| 3:13:00| You know, we want you to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| We don't want to have to mess with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| But, you know, if I vote for this today, this would be the last time, you know, that I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11585)|
| 3:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| There's a reason I seconded Paul's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| It's not that I'm overly fond of Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| Actually, I am, but that's not the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| He's a sweet guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11604)|
| 3:13:28| I'm quite fond of all folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| The reason is that I think it's something we, the least we should do as sort of a caretaker role that we must assume here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:43| This came before us several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| We were very generous with the original proposition, and then they went around and brought in grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11625)|
| 3:13:54| And it fell out of, for whoever's fault or reason, it fell out of Medicare-Medicaid certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11634)|
| 3:14:01| which one certainly could argue, and I argued a few months ago, was a material breach of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11641)|
| 3:14:08| And I pointed out last time that, yeah, there are flaws with the star system, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| If you add it all up, the provider here is below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| Too many one, two stars, not enough four and fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| And I pointed out today that rather than agreeing to a fine in Arkansas, they challenged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:26| So I don't, I'm not really enamored with the provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| but I thought that Paul's resolution to use the star system to prompt a review was a reasonable way for us to exercise our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:39| caretaking authority that we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| And that's why I agreed to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| And I think in some ways I agree with Commissioner Smith that we should be doing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| We should be angrier about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| That losing Medicare certification is a terrible sign of neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| And that one star at Hillcrest North is a dangerous sign for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:03| But I'm willing to go with the lesser penalty of the caretaker obligation that Paul has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11703)|
| 3:15:09| And I hope that's why we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11709)|
| 3:15:13| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| You know, there's not a whole huge difference in these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| The real difference comes down to this business over this automatic trigger, which I know you're saying that it's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:28| Well, my proposal says it's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| My proposal reminds these folks that any commissioner at any time can bring this back to this agenda and can put them on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11731)|
| 3:15:41| Now, we're looking at this through what we've been through over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:47| But these folks have not been here the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:51| We had a vendor that was operating this facility and apparently ran it in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11751)|
| 3:15:58| To use an aviation term, it stalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11758)|
| 3:16:04| Now this company has taken over and they have started to make significant progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:10| We had unlicensed facilities that are now licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| Now, things don't get fixed overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| Ships don't get recommissioned overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| Airplanes don't get recommissioned overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| Buildings don't get renovated overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| I've seen a lot of these renovation projects throughout town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| We'll approve a TIF and it will be a year or two later before we see the benefits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11787)|
| 3:16:32| We are already seeing the benefits of what these folks have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| And all I'm asking that we do is that we just let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| Now, if they don't do their job, any commissioner at any time that is sitting on this commission can put a resolution back on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:49| agenda saying let's put them on 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| I think this talk of 30-day notice is hurting these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11812)|
| 3:16:56| I think it's hurting their progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| And I'm saying we have new folks here who have already shown phenomenal progress and I'm saying let's just get out of their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11818)|
| 3:17:05| Now, if we want to ask them to come back and show us what progress they're making, I think that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:11| And I would have accepted most of what you proposed, Paul, as a friendly amendment because I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:16| I think that when we have something that's being turned around that we need as good public servants, we need to keep an eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11836)|
| 3:17:26| Commissioner Lambert, let me take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| Paul, I have the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:31| We still are using Robert's rules of order, I think, on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| I'm saying let's give these folks time to continue to do what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| And, you know, you're saying let's automatically revisit this, you know, put them on notice for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:48| And I'm saying that that is completely unnecessary and that language hurts these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| It hurts these folks unnecessarily because any commission can put it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11873)|
| 3:17:58| and if the commissioner gets a majority of votes, they're put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| We don't need to restate that with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| And I don't think we need to treat these folks like they're the ones that have been there since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| And I was right with you in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| But it's not 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| It's not the old company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:18| It's a new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11898)|
| 3:18:19| And my proposal is simply that we just give these folks time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| They know that we have the power to put them on 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| We don't need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:28| We don't need to scare citizens with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| And we don't need to beat up on these folks for what the previous owners did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| And that's why I'm voting against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:39| And I'm going to support the original motion that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| And I wish you had let them be combined so that we wouldn't have to argue about this so much because we are so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:51| We are so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| Mr. Lambert, just to kind of reinforce what you're saying, Dr. Harmon's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11933)|
| 3:19:00| We have several buildings that are one stars and two stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| Our company has purchased or gotten involved with more than 80% of our buildings in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:12| And we are a company that takes on troubled buildings and works on improving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11952)|
| 3:19:19| Our fear in getting involved with Hillcrest in the beginning was they were in a whole lot of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| And we were afraid the commission would look at our history and use it against them and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:30| here's a company with a bunch of buildings that have underperformed historically because they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:36| in all this data they don't show the changes of ownership and when we got involved and when we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:43| So that's been our challenge with these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:47| I think our fears certainly have been manifested in what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| We don't want to hurt this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| We really came up here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| We have deferred management fees on this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=11996)|
| 3:20:00| We aren't making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| We're losing money every week up here helping these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| And we really have been climbing uphill with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| But we have had great success here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| And we really want to continue to show you that we will continue to have great success here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12013)|
| 3:20:18| We have an extremely good reputation in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:23| I'm averaging less than three deficiencies across this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:27| And I really want to continue with these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12027)|
| 3:20:31| And I'll guarantee you, you can hand them to anybody else in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| they aren't going to run them any better than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| I guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| Okay, we're going to continue to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:41| And if we could try to make our comments a little quicker so we can get done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| Thanks, Chairman, for that, when you called on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:51| I didn't plan to talk about this, but I'm not going to be on here after September either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12051)|
| 3:20:57| but I feel like I have to express how I feel about my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12057)|
| 3:21:02| My number one priority is that the patients at all these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| with Hillcrest and nursing homes in our area, are taken care of, well taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12066)|
| 3:21:12| There's just no excuse when patients are neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| I'm a patient advocate all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12076)|
| 3:21:19| I grew up with Hillcrest North all my life, and so I want to see Hillcrest continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12079)|
| 3:21:27| and Knox County needs that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| My family is in the medical care, and if Hillcrest just went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12091)|
| 3:21:36| we were going to be in big-time trouble in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:39| However, taking you all off notice, and I wasn't on commission in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:47| but I was last year when we voted and gave you all the opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:52| and I realized grace came into a hornet's nest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12112)|
| 3:21:56| But grace knew what they were coming into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12116)|
| 3:21:59| So there's no excuses for grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| And you have made some big differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12122)|
| 3:22:06| and I think it's because that this commission has held you all's feet to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| And I don't really want to take you off notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| because I want you all to take us serious in Knox County and the people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12134)|
| 3:22:20| that we demand excellent, above excellent, the best care that anybody can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12140)|
| 3:22:28| Because mistakes happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| Everybody's human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12150)|
| 3:22:31| And, you know, there are going to be things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12151)|
| 3:22:37| But like I say, everybody's human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| I mean, it's just like we go out and we have an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| I mean, it's an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:43| But then there are some things that should not be overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| So I'm not for taking Hillcrest off notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:50| Just simply, it's like I raised my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| Here's what I expect out of you, and if you don't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| you're going to get punished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| And if they know there's not a consequence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| then why are they concerned about whether they do right or wrong, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:07| So I really appreciate the hard work that Grace has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12187)|
| 3:23:12| I'm all for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12192)|
| 3:23:13| I want you just, you know, in the terms of taking Medicare and Medicaid patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:17| and that all nursing homes have to do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12197)|
| 3:23:22| But they don't have to take everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| Because when a hospital calls a nursing home to put a patient there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12205)|
| 3:23:31| they come and interview that patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| And there are loopholes everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12214)|
| 3:23:36| No, we're not going to take a kidney dialysis patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| which is a big thing with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| Hillcrest takes those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| Nursing homes can flat say, no, not taking you, because we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| There are so many stipulations there that, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| every nursing home does not have to take that patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| And they don't take that patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| So I just want to tell you that from Seventh District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| our number one concern is to make sure the patient is taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:04| and two, that they're families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12244)|
| 3:24:06| So to leave you on notice is not a thing to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12246)|
| 3:24:13| I want to see Grace and Hillcrest fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| It's that I want to let you know that this commission is serious about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:21| and that we expect it to be higher than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12261)|
| 3:24:25| We want to see it four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| I mean, that's what we think our area and that's what we think our seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| and it's not just seniors, it's all ages that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:34| And we want them to make sure they've got number one care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12274)|
| 3:24:39| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| And I want you all to know I'm not a foreigner, I'm a UT boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| So I went to school up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| and I know I've known these Hillcrest buildings for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| I just wanted to make one last comment on this and first ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12292)|
| 3:24:56| When did Grace take over the management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| I remember it was shortly after our discussions with the previous management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| I mean, we're really talking about two different companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| and two different management groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| We had the old one, which obviously had some difficulties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| and then Grace took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| When was that, just to refresh my memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| April 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| Of 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12318)|
| 3:25:19| So we're just a little bit over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| You know, I think what we're saying is that we want to see progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12321)|
| 3:25:24| and that's the question I'm asking myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12324)|
| 3:25:26| We've gone from a facility that had been decertified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| and could not receive Medicare patients to a facility now that's at least receiving Medicare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| We have another facility, if I understood correct, in the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| that's gone from one star to three stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| And the grade or the scoring is still out on the north facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| but they've been reevaluated recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:49| We've had another annual survey that was an excellent survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| and anticipate this one that should happen any time to be another really good survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12352)|
| 3:25:58| So we should see those stars move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12360)|
| 3:26:01| So, you know, really the question I'm asking myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| have we seen progress in the period of time that Grace has had the management of the facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:10| And I think the answer to that question is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12370)|
| 3:26:13| And really to sort of reiterate what some of the others have said, we expect, you know, progress to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:19| and I know you want it to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12379)|
| 3:26:20| Now, where it happens or not is how well it's managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:24| But, you know, but I think that, you know, I think that with what we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12384)|
| 3:26:28| and some of you know here, even going back to 2008, I was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12388)|
| 3:26:34| I really would have liked to have privatized Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12394)|
| 3:26:37| That's a whole other story, but we've got what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12397)|
| 3:26:40| And I think that, you know, I think that I would have to support the motion that, you know, we allow this to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12400)|
| 3:26:47| I think it probably is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| You can come down here and give us the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| We want to continue to see progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| Just because there's a stumbling block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| and I do realize that this is an average over a longer period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| and that's why you can't just turn it around with one inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12419)|
| 3:27:04| that I'm going to support the motion that's on the floor for that, for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:12| Because I think to stagnate with one stars or what's perceived as poor service isn't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12432)|
| 3:27:19| But I think in this case, because we are seeing progress, and some is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12439)|
| 3:27:23| I mean, to go from one to three is pretty good progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12443)|
| 3:27:26| And I was actually surprised that you got recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| I thought there'd be enough problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12450)|
| 3:27:31| That might be more of a difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| But, you know, for that reason, I'm going to go ahead and support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| but agree also that we need to come down and have quarterly reports on what's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12461)|
| 3:27:42| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12462)|
| 3:27:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| Sir, how many facilities you say you have in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| We have 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12467)|
| 3:27:48| How many of them do you get free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12470)|
| 3:27:51| How many do you get free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| You mean as far as paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12474)|
| 3:27:57| Paying or taxes or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12477)|
| 3:27:58| How many do you get free, like Hillcrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12482)|
| 3:28:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12483)|
| 3:28:04| So that's what I'm trying to say is you've got more capital to use to bring these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12484)|
| 3:28:09| Now, I'm going to say this about Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| He don't want to take advice from you car salesmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12491)|
| 3:28:14| but it's definitely that he don't know how to run a business because in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| if you don't produce, they fire you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| Now, I don't think we've got to have standards just like you have standards for your children to live by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12500)|
| 3:28:25| things they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| And I don't think we're asking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| Now, Lumpy, that don't mean that we're going to revoke them just as soon as they come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12508)|
| 3:28:33| but it gives us the right to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12513)|
| 3:28:36| And if they fall below a one star, they're getting everything free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Let them hire more help down there to take care of these people with that money instead of putting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12519)|
| 3:28:44| I don't care about these people out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| I don't care if they have to hitchhike back to where they came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12526)|
| 3:28:49| I'm concerned about the citizens of Knox County, and we're getting it free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| and that's the reason why I appreciate Mr. Harmon's second to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12536)|
| 3:28:57| We're on a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| Would you restate again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| You're saying in your motion that we will ask them to come back quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| but also in the motion is if they fall below one star, is it an automatic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:13| No, it's a could be, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| It's a could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| That's why I want to check the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| That's with a 30-day termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| Puts them on their 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| That's all we can do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| His words were fall below a one star, which means no stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| Fall to one star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| Two is below average and one star is two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| I'm restating what Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| Well, that's what I'm asking is because I'm hearing different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| I want to make sure I understand the exact wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:43| Is it to fall to a one star?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| If they fall below a one star, they go to a special focus facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| Can we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| So right now they're a one star already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| Does that mean that they fall to that or are they already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| Well, it just means that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| Well, I believe he said west was coming up with the rational evaluation you had, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12601)|
| 3:30:05| North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12606)|
| 3:30:07| Okay, north I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12607)|
| 3:30:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12608)|

| 3:31:31| Motion passes, 11 ayes, 7 noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12691)|
| 3:31:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12705)|
| 3:31:51| On page 14, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12711)|
| 3:31:57| establishing the policies and procedures by which employees, taxpayers, and other citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12717)|
| 3:32:01| may confidentially report suspect illegal, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12721)|
| 3:32:07| Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12729)|
| 3:32:10| Recommend approval 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12733)|
| 3:32:14| Recommend to approve 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12737)|
| 3:32:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12738)|
| 3:32:19| Well, commissioners, if I could interject, my apologies, but this resolution actually requires you to make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12739)|
| 3:32:27| If you look on the second page, in order to form this hotline, although it's mandated by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| the details have not been worked out in terms of name, structure, functioning, branding, the manner in which it's to be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12753)|
| 3:32:40| So the audit committee asked the full commission to make a determination whether the entire commission wants to get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:46| in the mechanics of this process or, on the alternative, either form a committee of so many members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12766)|
| 3:32:53| or punt it back to the audit committee to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12776)|
| 3:32:57| Commissioner Shouse, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12777)|
| 3:32:58| I think that's a good synopsis of our conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12778)|
| 3:33:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12781)|
| 3:33:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12782)|
| 3:33:03| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12783)|
| 3:33:04| I think if we form a committee, I think that sponsoring commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| since they work on both sides of it, could make the decision for bringing it before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12787)|
| 3:33:15| When you're on the audit committee, I mean, if we form a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12795)|
| 3:33:21| I think the people that have been working with it since day one should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12801)|
| 3:33:27| Are you saying you just want to go ahead and just allow the audit committee to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:34| Or are you saying did you want to form a three-person committee with Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| Yeah, that's why if we're going to form a committee, I mean, if we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| it ought to be the ones that have been working with it from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:43| I mean, you guys are in there with them every day or every meeting, unless you all feel like that's a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12823)|
| 3:33:51| We deferred to commission to get the will of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12831)|
| 3:33:55| and we being the three of us on the commission and the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12835)|
| 3:33:59| along with our two other audit members and Joe and Mike Reeves, we met for an hour or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12839)|
| 3:34:06| I guess what we're trying to determine is how to filter the data that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12846)|
| 3:34:13| We heard Whistleblower talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12853)|
| 3:34:16| We hear from Brad at lots of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| and that would be the kind of things that this hotline would hear or would get calls from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12858)|
| 3:34:25| Some people would leave their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| I'm Sam Smith, and here's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| Let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12869)|
| 3:34:30| And a lot would be anonymous, and a lot would be things that were truly trivial, possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12870)|
| 3:34:37| or go to HR, a speeding county vehicle, somebody smoking in the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12877)|
| 3:34:42| or a dispute over somebody does more work than the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| But some will be things that will go, probably wind up with the DA or wind up the ethics committee, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| We're just trying to get some direction on how to filter it and to sort the data out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12893)|
| 3:34:58| and I think we left it, correct me please, David and Finbar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12898)|
| 3:35:02| at the meeting we had on July the 6th with Joe, our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12902)|
| 3:35:11| to determine who on his staff could handle it and, of course, the volume of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12911)|
| 3:35:16| I think we'll have about 900 to 1,000 roughly on average, three a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:22| Statistically, counties that have formed these, that's where statistics flesh out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| and that's going to be the challenge, of course, is separating frivolous claims from valid claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12927)|
| 3:35:32| But, again, just the entire mechanics of this, how you want it set up, the reporting mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:37| the filtering mechanism really should be done by a smaller, I think, tight run committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12937)|
| 3:35:42| that can then report back its findings, and the commission can then tweak it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| Because, again, a committee does just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| It makes recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| It certainly is positive for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12950)|
| 3:35:53| and I think in light of what happened the last three years and all those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12953)|
| 3:35:58| and the continuous allegations we hear of solid waste and just whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| this is something that state law mandates that it will certainly help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| And looking at $600 million budgets, $8,000, it's a relatively very almost nothing kind of deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12966)|
| 3:36:12| But we need some direction, and what do you guys think about, I mean, audit committee to handle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12972)|
| 3:36:18| or just to handle the filtering of the sorting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:23| Well, I mean, traditionally, I would, on the legal part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12983)|
| 3:36:27| if it's something that needs to go to the DA, I'd rather go through the law department first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| I mean, the law department would be your filter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| because they can just decide if it's HR or criminal or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12993)|
| 3:36:39| Frivolous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=12999)|
| 3:36:40| Frivolous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13000)|
| 3:36:41| And I hate to put work on the law department, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13001)|
| 3:36:45| Well, I do think it has legal implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| But, again, there's also administrative implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| How does the webpage design the mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13009)|
| 3:36:52| That's what the committee is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| It's clearly going to, a lot of it's going to have to be punted to me to see if we have valid legal claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13014)|
| 3:36:59| And if someone reports something that's clearly criminal in nature, I'm going to have to send that to the DA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13019)|
| 3:37:04| If somebody reports something that's not fiscal, but a violation of your policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13024)|
| 3:37:08| it's going to be punted to, perhaps, the ethics committee or to HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13028)|
| 3:37:12| if it's a singular employee committing an act that's not, maybe, illegal, but contrary to your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13032)|
| 3:37:17| But, again, the purpose of a subcommittee would be, essentially, to work out all the other details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13037)|
| 3:37:22| even the matter in which it appears on the webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| How that's going to be designed is going to be also a telephone hotline, a physical box to write a logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13045)|
| 3:37:33| Those are the things that are administrative and beyond the legal aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13053)|
| 3:37:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13063)|
| 3:37:44| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| I think what we had was a couple hours of discussion around all these issues of where we think the reports might come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13066)|
| 3:37:59| who's going to determine if they're frivolous or legitimate or if they're legal questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13079)|
| 3:38:07| I believe that at the end of our meeting or at the end of our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| we thought we needed to get back with commission, full commission, to determine what the next step might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| Do you want three different committee people to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13098)|
| 3:38:23| Do you want the audit committee with some of the ideas that we've thrashed around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| And I really think it should not just be the three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| It should be the full audit committee, if that's what you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| because we get the expertise or input of a person from Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13116)|
| 3:38:40| and an excellent chairmanship person from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| plus a couple of other people here within Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13124)|
| 3:38:48| So I think we were just giving a readout of where we stood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| some of the thoughts that we had behind what may need to happen with this fraud, abuse, theft, whatever, fraud, abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13133)|
| 3:39:05| So we need to name it first, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13145)|
| 3:39:08| We need to call it SPOT or something and get a name to it and then come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13148)|
| 3:39:16| We're not off to approve something or implement something in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| We are at the end of a two-hour discussion from a previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13160)|
| 3:39:26| We're giving you a readout of where we think we stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| and if you'd like for us to look at it further about coming up with actual policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13169)|
| 3:39:35| in conformance with some guidelines out of the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13175)|
| 3:39:39| we'll be happy to be back with that in a month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13179)|
| 3:39:46| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| I think Commissioner Wright well reflected the discussion we had in a brief manner at the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13188)|
| 3:39:54| and we're certainly willing to come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| I think he indicated we just wanted some input back from the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13195)|
| 3:40:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| In reading the resolution, however, I don't know if it allows for what you all are suggesting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13206)|
| 3:40:14| It looks like we can either choose all of the commissioners or X number of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13214)|
| 3:40:21| It doesn't allow for the members of the audit committee that aren't commissioners to serve on this policy model group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13221)|
| 3:40:32| So I guess we might need to update that if we want the audit committee to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13232)|
| 3:40:40| and give us a rock that we can take a look at, which is what I think this is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13240)|
| 3:40:46| and what the law directors charged us was pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13246)|
| 3:40:52| So I guess what I'm suggesting is that I see A here, the entire commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13252)|
| 3:40:57| or B, committee consisting of X number of commissioners, and we choose C, the audit committee, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13257)|
| 3:41:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13266)|
| 3:41:07| Again, I gleaned this from what I thought the conversations were, but you can certainly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| a resolution, unlike an ordinance, is an express will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13271)|
| 3:41:14| You can certainly just insert an option three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13274)|
| 3:41:17| and you can vote to appoint the audit committee to come up with a model for the full commission to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13277)|
| 3:41:24| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13287)|
| 3:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| Does everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| Motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13293)|
| 3:41:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Excuse me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13297)|
| 3:41:38| I would invite anybody interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| The audit committee meets next on September 7th at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| That's a Tuesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13305)|
| 3:41:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13307)|
| 3:41:48| I wanted to have a point of privilege to ask that we suspend the rules to add an item to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13308)|
| 3:41:54| I want to thank Commissioner Anders for giving us this information on the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| Well, actually, I need to make a correction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| I misread the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13320)|
| 3:42:02| There's no fines that have been unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13322)|
| 3:42:04| I misread the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13324)|
| 3:42:05| I was looking at the right-hand and the date paid, and so the chart's been misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13330)|
| 3:42:11| There's nothing to be declared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13331)|
| 3:42:12| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13332)|
| 3:42:13| Because I was going to ask that we address this today, but if that's the case, then I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13333)|
| 3:42:17| I made an error reading the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13339)|
| 3:42:20| It's purely my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13340)|
| 3:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| regarding the process by which an audit of the outgoing county mayor's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13345)|
| 3:42:29| shall be conducted, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13349)|
| 3:42:32| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13352)|
| 3:42:34| Recommend to approve 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13354)|
| 3:42:36| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13356)|
| 3:42:38| Recommend to approve 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13360)|
| 3:42:42| If I could, Commissioners, once again, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13362)|
| 3:42:45| You do have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| As I mentioned earlier at the beginning of every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13366)|
| 3:42:48| this is one where you actually have to make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13368)|
| 3:42:51| You're either going to decide to have the internal auditor audit the outgoing administration or KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| The Audit Committee, and again, I won't speak for the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| but from all of the events that have occurred up until now, you're probably safest to action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13381)|
| 3:43:08| and the one that would draw the less, I think, legal criticism would be to have KPMG conduct this audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13388)|
| 3:43:14| rather than the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| But that's a decision I'll defer to the Commission's wisdom on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| I'll take that as an amendment to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13401)|
| 3:43:25| Does the second agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13410)|
| 3:43:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| Did he give us a dollar figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13415)|
| 3:43:39| No, sir, but they're under a continuing contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| and they're doing a lot of these as we speak, just as a matter of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13421)|
| 3:43:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13428)|
| 3:43:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| On page 15, ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13434)|
| 3:43:58| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13438)|
| 3:44:01| amending Chapter 12 of the Knox County Code entitled Businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13441)|
| 3:44:04| by adding a new Article 4 to prohibit a business or entity in possession of a Knox County business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13444)|

| 3:45:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13514)|
| 3:45:16| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13520)|
| 3:45:21| Yeah, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13521)|
| 3:45:25| I seconded the motion to deny because if I read this right, and maybe I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13525)|
| 3:45:32| it prohibits restaurants that if they choose to allow folks to bring their dogs to the patio area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13532)|
| 3:45:45| will this prohibit them from being able to do that if the restaurant chooses to allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13545)|
| 3:45:51| Sir, the purpose of the ordinance was to mirror state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13551)|
| 3:45:54| which was to try to find a mechanism by which counties can regulate pet dogs entering restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13554)|
| 3:46:01| So if a restaurant has an outdoor patio and they want to permit dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13561)|
| 3:46:05| they would have to come to the county and get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13565)|
| 3:46:08| This then affords the county the opportunity through the health department to ensure compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13568)|
| 3:46:13| because the fear is, of course, that dogs will wander, get into the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| get in contact with people who are serving food, which is contrary to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13576)|
| 3:46:22| So what this is, the law basically reads if you're going to permit pet dogs in restaurants in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13582)|
| 3:46:30| you need to have a permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| And that's what this ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13592)|
| 3:46:33| So this is actually creating the process that I'd like to see created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13597)|
| 3:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13598)|
| 3:46:40| I'll withdraw my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13600)|
| 3:46:41| There's a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| Substitute motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13604)|
| 3:46:45| I mean, you know, because, like I said, I mean, I don't think we ought to force restaurants to allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13605)|
| 3:46:49| but I think if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| They have to choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13611)|
| 3:46:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| They should be allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| Well, you know, we had a big discussion about this in Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13616)|
| 3:47:00| I am a pet lover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| I have two beagles that some of my neighbors probably wish I didn't own, but they're my babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13622)|
| 3:47:08| I love all animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13628)|
| 3:47:11| But being very health conscious, you always see Carringer's going around with antibacteria here to try to keep germs off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13631)|
| 3:47:22| I really hadn't thought much about it until my husband and I had an encounter with this on a restaurant on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13642)|
| 3:47:30| that we like to frequent very often and set it out on their patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13650)|
| 3:47:34| Several tables were available around us, but we had a couple that showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13654)|
| 3:47:39| and I'm not talking a little poodle, but a great dane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| Even though they had it on a leash, it came over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| They sat right beside us, which was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| I had no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13668)|
| 3:47:49| I love children, but I think children should be taught to behave where they're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13669)|
| 3:47:54| although that doesn't happen sometimes, and our pets are the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13674)|
| 3:47:59| So this couple let their dog roam the patio, and it came right over between my husband and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13679)|
| 3:48:09| while we had our food and put its face right up on our table right in between us and around our food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13689)|
| 3:48:16| And I said this last Tuesday, I don't like my own dogs in my food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13696)|
| 3:48:21| and I certainly don't want somebody else's dogs in my food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13701)|
| 3:48:25| I think we have created another problem for restaurant owners as well as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13705)|
| 3:48:31| There's no way an employee at a restaurant and being outside that you can't walk by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13711)|
| 3:48:38| and want to pet a child's head or want to pet a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13718)|
| 3:48:42| And then how do we know that they go and wash their hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13722)|
| 3:48:44| Dogs have germs just like us humans, and you don't know if all of them have all their vaccines and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13724)|
| 3:48:54| So, y'all, I just can't go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13734)|
| 3:48:58| I don't want anybody taking this that I don't love animals because I am a big animal lover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| But I just do not think the health is good, and also this dog went right over to a child in their car seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13743)|
| 3:49:13| Y'all have heard me talk about this before, but I'm really passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13753)|
| 3:49:19| How do you keep a dog from just wanting to bite somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13759)|
| 3:49:22| You've got other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13762)|
| 3:49:24| But, anyway, another concern was, was it going to be a $20, $25 fee, law director, that these restaurants had to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13764)|
| 3:49:34| $20, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13774)|
| 3:49:36| And so my big concern was who is going to monitor that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13776)|
| 3:49:39| Is it going to be the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13779)|
| 3:49:40| Is it going to be Knox County codes or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:43| So how often is that, how is that really going to be monitored on a quarterly basis and yearly or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13783)|
| 3:49:55| I just can't go for it because I don't think the health reasons are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13795)|
| 3:50:02| Martha Buchanan, director of Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| Just to address your question of monitoring the way this is set up, the clerk's office collects the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13805)|
| 3:50:11| and then our staff, by virtue of the fact that they're in restaurants already, will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13811)|
| 3:50:17| and will be doing checking to make sure permits are in place and that that fee has been assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13817)|
| 3:50:23| and if there are violations going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| So it will be a cooperative effort between the clerk's office and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13825)|
| 3:50:29| Our staff are generally in facilities once or twice a year, frequently more often than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13829)|
| 3:50:36| Since we inspect every single food complaint that comes in, we are in there much more frequently than twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13836)|
| 3:50:42| So we do have opportunity to work with these restaurateurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13842)|
| 3:50:45| and with the clerk's office to make sure these are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13845)|
| 3:50:51| Well, and I agree with, you know, there's just no way that this can really be monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13851)|
| 3:50:57| Dogs, how are you going to keep them if they get in a dog fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13857)|
| 3:51:01| I mean, it's been you're seeing our dogs know how to behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13861)|
| 3:51:07| They sit and they mind their owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| But I've just been around where my beagles don't mind me half the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13869)|
| 3:51:13| So I just have a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| The health and the safety of this is just like I don't want anybody smoking and we ban that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13875)|
| 3:51:21| But when I choose to sit outside, some smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13881)|
| 3:51:25| But I just don't think the health and safety is something that commission ought to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13885)|
| 3:51:30| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| Yes, this is the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13892)|
| 3:51:33| Joe, how do you determine a pet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13893)|
| 3:51:37| How do you determine a pet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13897)|
| 3:51:38| Yeah, I used to rabbit hunt and I'd have eight beagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13898)|
| 3:51:41| What if I wanted to stop back on a trip, meet and go in one of these places and eat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| Could I take all my beagles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| Paul and I have something in common with these beagles and I haven't harmed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13909)|
| 3:51:53| Right now I have schnauzers, but I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13913)|
| 3:51:56| They don't eat in the kitchen where I eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13916)|
| 3:51:58| But I'm going to vote for this and the reason why is I think a person that owns a business should have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13918)|
| 3:52:06| If you don't want to eat there because they let someone bring a dog in, don't go eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13926)|
| 3:52:11| I think if a person owns a restaurant, I don't believe in this anti-smoking law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13931)|
| 3:52:15| I think you should have the right to allow smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13935)|
| 3:52:18| And if you don't want to participate in my restaurant because I allow smoking, don't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13938)|
| 3:52:22| These restaurants will come around to the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13942)|
| 3:52:25| They want your dollar, so if they don't want dogs in there because it's hurting their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13945)|
| 3:52:29| they won't come up and get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13949)|
| 3:52:32| So I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13952)|
| 3:52:33| I will say, Commissioners, and again, it all comes down to enforceability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13953)|
| 3:52:37| but the state law outlines the specificity when and how a pet dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13957)|
| 3:52:41| defined really as anything other than a service dog like a seeing eye dog or other help dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13961)|
| 3:52:45| virtual panoply for things they can't do, they can't be allowed on chairs, tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13965)|
| 3:52:50| anywhere near food is being prepared, anywhere in the interior of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13970)|
| 3:52:54| Employees are not permitted to touch the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| If they do, by happenstance, they have to immediately go back and wash up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13976)|
| 3:53:03| They have to be kept on a leash at all times and under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| I mean, I'm just letting you know the state, oddly enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| did actually put some pretty strict parameters, which is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13990)|
| 3:53:13| What you're saying then is if I take up hunting again, I can bring my beagles in and eat with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13993)|
| 3:53:17| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=13997)|
| 3:53:20| There's an exception for fox hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14002)|
| 3:53:28| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14008)|
| 3:53:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14009)|
| 3:53:30| To me, the deciding factor is that it's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| We're not telling the restaurant owner you have to do this, but it's optional to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14012)|
| 3:53:37| and I'm sure there's exceptions to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| There's bad pets, just like there's bad kids who get unruly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14019)|
| 3:53:44| It's been very popular downtown here, up on the Market Square, down on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| As hot as it is, you may not see it tonight, but on lots of evenings, you'll see a dozen animals out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14029)|
| 3:53:54| They seem to be well-behaved, and I think it's a good option for people to bring their pets downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14034)|
| 3:54:00| and to enjoy anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| Of course, we're talking about out in the county now, so I think it's great to let the people in the county enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14043)|
| 3:54:07| the option that the people in the city currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14047)|
| 3:54:10| We don't have to go eat there, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14050)|
| 3:54:13| It's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14053)|
| 3:54:14| I mean, it's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=14054)|
