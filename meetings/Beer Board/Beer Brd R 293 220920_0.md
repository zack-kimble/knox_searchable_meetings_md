| 0:06:11| You guys normally do your events in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Did you shifted for COVID or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| We're expecting 100,000 people this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| We had 55,000 in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| So moving to have space for that many people and moving in three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| But also with the college students not being here in June, we get probably 2,000 emails asking us to be later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=384)|

| 0:18:50| that's going to delay their inspections, and their opening date is December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Do we need to put a time frame, or are they okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1134)|

| 0:22:35| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Yes, my name is Edward Romero, and address is 1845 Albershire Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1357)|

| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| So on March 17th, 2022, you were cited for sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| which was your first in the two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| On March 23rd, 2022, you submitted a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| and then August 26th, cited again for the sale of a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| and then on August 30th, you received notice of administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| sent and received, and then receipt of a revised remedial plan and fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| Do you want to share a little bit about where you are, your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| how you intend to ensure this violation doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Hey, we have come up with three more different policy on the management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| and one is that we buy the machine, the ID scanner, to verify the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| The second one, we're making every server to write the due dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| or birth dates on their notebooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and the third one is that even if they verify with the machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| they've got to go to the manager who's in charge on that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| to verify the ID as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| and they're not allowed to sell alcohol without the permission of a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I just wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| so you mentioned that you guys are going to purchase the card reader machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| When will you actually have them on your premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| We already did two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Two weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Have all of your staff been trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Have all of your staff been trained on how to use the card reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Everybody has been using it since the machine got bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Yes, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I was reading through your responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| and I was pleased to see that you had those two additional methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| of making sure you're IDing people properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| and dealing with the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I thought that was really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| and then having that extra layer as well with the managers on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| You know, if you have another issue in this two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| then you'll go straight to a revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| But I'm going to suggest that we do take no action today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| because of all the work you've done to help make sure you have policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| to prevent this, and certainly want to make sure you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| and appreciate your work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| And I just want to apologize for, you know, it shouldn't happen, but it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| So, you know, we're trying to fix our problems internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| We have a recommendation to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Well, good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Hope we see you there and not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Anyone from O'Rourke's maybe shown up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Do we want to make a motion to postpone 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| I see they were here on May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| They weren't here on August 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt if my colleagues approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and make a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| If there's no activity by then, I don't think I'll be making such a motion next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Mr. Barr, can I ask if you've been in contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| I have, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I spoke with Ms. Scarborough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I sent a little reminder email out, I think, Thursday, and we didn't connect back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| She sent me a voicemail assuring me that she would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| But things do come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| I don't know what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| So, she's aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| She is aware, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I was just going to say, Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| are you saying extend for 90 days or postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Like, should we give her another opportunity to show up at the next beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| I would recommend 30, I think, for her to show, if, in fact, you've been in touch with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I'll withdraw my motion and make another motion to postpone for 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220920?start=1638)|
