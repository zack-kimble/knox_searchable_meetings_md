| 5:44:02| or it could be drawn in such a way that it favors Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20642)|
| 5:44:07| We may well be running against each other in 2010 if we both choose to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20647)|
| 5:44:13| Giving one of us, but not both of us, a seat at the table is very unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20653)|
| 5:44:20| And that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20660)|
| 5:44:23| This is politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20663)|
| 5:44:24| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20664)|
| 5:44:25| It's never going to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20665)|
| 5:44:27| but we need to make it as fair as possible by giving every one of us a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20667)|
| 5:44:33| And I'm sure you know that a lot of folks don't want to go to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20673)|
| 5:44:38| They would rather just have a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20678)|
| 5:44:40| Let somebody else bring us a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20680)|
| 5:44:43| You know, and if you're part of the downtown crowd, silk stocking crowd, as Kaz Walker used to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20683)|
| 5:44:51| I'm sure that there will be fine folks on that commission that will take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20691)|
| 5:44:55| But for those of us who have a minority opinion, who have an opinion that isn't always appreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20695)|
| 5:45:01| redistricting could draw folks like myself, and on the other side of the spectrum, folks like Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20701)|
| 5:45:08| It could completely draw us out of a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20708)|
| 5:45:12| The districts could be realigned so that the districts be made where we couldn't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20712)|
| 5:45:18| That's why I think that the only fair way to do it, if we want to be as fair as absolutely possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20718)|
| 5:45:25| is if every member of this commission has a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20725)|
| 5:45:29| and I have no objection to adding a few experts to it because we will need that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20729)|
| 5:45:36| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20736)|
| 5:45:37| I don't know of any of us here that has the expertise, but everybody here deserves a seat at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20737)|
| 5:45:44| because their constituencies deserve a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20744)|
| 5:45:48| I don't sit here as myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20748)|
| 5:45:50| I sit here representing a certain constituency, a fairly conservative constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20750)|
| 5:45:56| They deserve a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20756)|
| 5:45:59| Their seat at the table is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20759)|
| 5:46:02| Mr. Anders has a different constituency than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20762)|
| 5:46:05| We both serve the 6th District, but we both tend to do better at different precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20765)|
| 5:46:10| His people deserve a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20770)|
| 5:46:13| They deserve to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20773)|
| 5:46:15| And the only way that we can fairly represent the constituencies within this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20775)|
| 5:46:22| is if every one of us has a seat on that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20782)|
| 5:46:25| And if there's anything less than that, then I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20785)|
| 5:46:31| Commissioner Brault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20791)|
| 5:46:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20794)|
| 5:46:35| Lumpy, the fact that you've sat here and said that if you're on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20795)|
| 5:46:38| you're going to do everything you can to redraw the districts to favor conservative Republicans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20798)|
| 5:46:43| that makes me uncomfortable with you being on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20803)|
| 5:46:46| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20806)|
| 5:46:47| That's why you need to be on it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20807)|
| 5:46:49| Well, I'm interested in being as fair as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20809)|
| 5:46:53| As fair as possible to you as a liberal Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20813)|
| 5:46:56| No, as fair as possible to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20816)|
| 5:46:58| Commissioner Labrador, can you let her talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20818)|
| 5:47:00| I'm interested in being as fair as possible to Knox County and the residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20820)|
| 5:47:05| Now, I know that this is a majority Republican county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20825)|
| 5:47:09| Of course I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20829)|
| 5:47:10| We've got a majority number of Republicans on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20830)|
| 5:47:14| I'm not interested in redrawing these districts so that we have a Democrat sitting in every seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20834)|
| 5:47:19| That would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20839)|
| 5:47:21| Just as drawing it so that every seat is filled with a conservative Republican would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20841)|
| 5:47:28| That would be unfair representation for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20848)|
| 5:47:31| I want to do what's best and what's fair and what's in the best interest of everyone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20851)|
| 5:47:39| And that's what I think we need to keep our eyes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20859)|
| 5:47:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20862)|
| 5:47:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20864)|
| 5:47:45| And just listening to the conversation and the dialogue, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20865)|
| 5:47:49| this is why we don't need 19 people on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20869)|
| 5:47:52| Because if we're going to have all 19 of us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20872)|
| 5:47:55| then let's just plan on staying here hours and hours and hours trying to protect our seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20875)|
| 5:48:03| I mean, that's basically what we're looking at in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20883)|
| 5:48:06| We have got to do what is in the best interest of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20886)|
| 5:48:10| And if it is in the best interest of our citizens to have all 19 of us come in here and go through this every single night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20890)|
| 5:48:17| which is what we're going to end up doing, then let's do that if that's in their best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20897)|
| 5:48:22| You're going to have folks sitting here in this room that are going to be running against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20902)|
| 5:48:27| And, again, I agree with you, Mr. Lambert, it's politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20907)|
| 5:48:31| I'd like to see as much politics taken out of it as possible so that we can come in and have an objective drawing of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20911)|
| 5:48:40| Again, they've got to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20920)|
| 5:48:42| Nothing's going to be approved unless we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20922)|
| 5:48:45| And if they come in and if they say, here's why we did it, here's how we did it, and here's why we did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20925)|
| 5:48:50| if it doesn't make sense, we can always go back and do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20930)|
| 5:48:54| So the final decision rests with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20934)|
| 5:48:56| But the notion that all 19 of us are going to get together and try to redraw these districts, you talk about ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20936)|
| 5:49:02| I mean, if that's what the cable folks want, I mean, it's going to really get really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20942)|
| 5:49:06| But to me, let's leave it in the hands of the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20946)|
| 5:49:09| And if you're not comfortable with having, and I've never met this Mr. Ross, I don't know who he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20949)|
| 5:49:14| but I have met Frank Leuthold, and I know that he's going to be fair-minded because he's shown it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20954)|
| 5:49:19| And so if we can get some fair-minded people here who have one thing in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20959)|
| 5:49:24| and that is let's do what's best for Knox County, then I think that's the best for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20964)|
| 5:49:29| Then we can take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20969)|
| 5:49:31| But for all 19 of us to sit here night after night after night and try to draw a district in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20971)|
| 5:49:36| we've already seen what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20976)|
| 5:49:39| And so I think that it would be better, if Mr. Leuthold feels better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20979)|
| 5:49:42| and having some commissioners, maybe a committee of commissioners look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20982)|
| 5:49:46| If we feel, you know, again, we can work on mechanics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20986)|
| 5:49:51| but I think that we've got to go outside and get in these expert folks to come in and help us draw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20991)|
| 5:49:56| I don't know anything about drawing a district, don't really want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20996)|
| 5:49:59| but it's part of our responsibility and we're going to need the expert advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20999)|
| 5:50:04| But the notion of us sitting here night after night and arguing about Democrats versus Republicans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21004)|
| 5:50:08| and right wing versus left wing and, you know, let's do this and let's do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21008)|
| 5:50:12| and let's protect this and let's protect that, I don't think that's what our citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21012)|
| 5:50:16| I think they want us to be very businesslike and approach this in a businesslike way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21016)|
| 5:50:20| And so this is why I'm suggesting that we go to the consultants who know these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21020)|
| 5:50:25| and let them bring us the thing and then we can get into our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21025)|
| 5:50:28| and our diatribes and say the things we want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21028)|
| 5:50:34| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21034)|
| 5:50:35| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21035)|
| 5:50:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21037)|
| 5:50:39| Regardless of what the committee does or what this commission eventually votes to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21039)|
| 5:50:44| this has to be approved in Nashville to where it meets the state law also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21044)|
| 5:50:49| So we've got protection down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21049)|
| 5:50:55| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21055)|
| 5:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21057)|
| 5:50:58| It's obvious that I'm fighting a losing battle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21058)|
| 5:51:00| But since I'm one of the ones that's most concerned about this, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21060)|
| 5:51:04| how would you feel about adding me to your committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21064)|
| 5:51:12| I thought it was the chairman's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21072)|
| 5:51:16| He threw out a couple of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21076)|
| 5:51:26| Our law director says that it's only on the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21086)|
| 5:51:30| And so we would have to go through the process of redoing the agenda and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21090)|
| 5:51:35| So let me throw this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21095)|
| 5:51:36| What if we asked the chairman to come back at our meeting next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21096)|
| 5:51:41| after consulting with the law director and, you know, coming up with a plan for a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21101)|
| 5:51:48| Or the other option is by two-thirds vote you can amend the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21108)|
| 5:51:54| and you can put it on if you wanted to have a motion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21114)|
| 5:51:58| Because this is such an important issue, I just don't want to leave anything to chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21118)|
| 5:52:03| So if there's going to be a motion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21123)|
| 5:52:05| I would just suggest that there be a motion to add this to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21125)|
| 5:52:09| which would require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21129)|
| 5:52:11| If not, and you want to wait for another meeting, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21131)|
| 5:52:19| What's the will of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21139)|
| 5:52:21| Next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21141)|
| 5:52:23| Tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21143)|
| 5:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21144)|
| 5:52:25| Then I'll go ahead and make a motion that we add it to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21145)|
| 5:52:28| So he can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21148)|
| 5:52:32| It has to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21152)|
| 5:52:38| Yeah, that's a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21158)|
| 5:52:41| It was out of order for me to even make a motion since it's only a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21161)|
| 5:52:48| So you're making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21168)|
| 5:52:49| I'll make a motion that we add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21169)|
| 5:52:52| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21172)|
| 5:52:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21174)|
| 5:52:56| Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21176)|
| 5:52:58| Do we have any discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21178)|
| 5:53:00| No, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21180)|
| 5:53:03| The motion is to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21183)|
| 5:53:09| So then you can then have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21189)|
| 5:53:11| Do we have discussion on that, Commissioner Lambert, just to add it to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21191)|
| 5:53:15| Yeah, I know, but before I vote on whether to add it to the agenda or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21195)|
| 5:53:18| are you going to include me on the suggested committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21198)|
| 5:53:22| I'm going to leave it up to our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21202)|
| 5:53:24| I have confidence in our chairman to appoint a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21204)|
| 5:53:26| and whether it's made up of a mixture of commissioners and experts, that's entirely up to our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21206)|
| 5:53:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21213)|
| 5:53:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21215)|
| 5:53:36| Mr. Chairman, you've not asked anybody yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21216)|
| 5:53:38| You've not asked anybody from UT or Mr. Luthold or anybody yet, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21218)|
| 5:53:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21222)|
| 5:53:44| It's supposed to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21224)|
| 5:53:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21226)|
| 5:53:48| I'm turning my light off for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21228)|
| 5:53:50| We have a motion on the floor to add it to the agenda so we can vote on a possible motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21230)|
| 5:53:58| Well, we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21238)|
| 5:54:01| There's got to be a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21241)|
| 5:54:03| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21243)|

| 5:54:20| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21260)|
| 5:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21261)|
| 5:54:22| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21262)|
| 5:54:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21263)|
| 5:54:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21264)|
| 5:54:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21265)|
| 5:54:26| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21266)|
| 5:54:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21267)|
| 5:54:28| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21268)|
| 5:54:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21269)|
| 5:54:30| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21270)|
| 5:54:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21271)|
| 5:54:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21272)|

| 5:54:34| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21274)|

| 5:54:36| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21276)|
| 5:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21277)|
| 5:54:38| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21278)|
| 5:54:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21279)|
| 5:54:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21280)|
| 5:54:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21281)|
| 5:54:42| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21282)|
| 5:54:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21283)|
| 5:54:44| 18 yeses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21284)|
| 5:54:45| One, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21285)|
| 5:54:46| 18 yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21286)|
| 5:54:47| At least I didn't say what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21287)|
| 5:54:55| So it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21295)|
| 5:54:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21296)|
| 5:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21297)|
| 5:54:58| Let me try this, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21298)|
| 5:54:59| I'll make a motion that our Chairman select a committee to make recommendations to the full body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21299)|
| 5:55:04| with regards to possible redistricting in conjunction with the law director, law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21304)|
| 5:55:09| It consists of three commissioners and two, quote, experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21309)|
| 5:55:14| Perhaps the University of Tennessee person and Frank Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21314)|
| 5:55:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21321)|
| 5:55:25| So the committee of five with three committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21325)|
| 5:55:27| The committee would be five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21327)|
| 5:55:28| You would select three commissioners and you would have two members also of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21328)|
| 5:55:33| Then you would be empowered to bring in anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21333)|
| 5:55:35| All these committee meetings would have to be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21335)|
| 5:55:37| Any commissioner that wanted to could come and listen and hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21337)|
| 5:55:41| I just throw that out as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21341)|
| 5:55:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21345)|
| 5:55:51| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21351)|
| 5:55:53| You know, Lump, I came to your fleet committee the other day and was allowed to make a statement or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21353)|
| 5:55:59| And I think any commissioner, hopefully many of us will attend there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21359)|
| 5:56:03| and we could maybe not be a voting member, but having a commissioner being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21363)|
| 5:56:08| certainly had a great influence on the outcome of how this is recommended anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21368)|
| 5:56:14| This wouldn't be the final say, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21374)|
| 5:56:16| And I think it gets this ball rolling and maybe a week after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21376)|
| 5:56:21| I'm not pleading exhaustion, but I'm ready to stay here until midnight if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21381)|
| 5:56:26| But if we have a fresh look at this, maybe we can come close to the unanimity on it and not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21386)|
| 5:56:34| get all political philosophies involved and feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21394)|
| 5:56:43| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21403)|
| 5:56:47| We don't know who's going to be on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21407)|
| 5:56:49| He's going to pick something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21409)|
| 5:56:50| We're not voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21410)|
| 5:56:51| You're giving the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21411)|
| 5:56:52| We're not voting on it, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21412)|
| 5:56:53| I want to know who he's going to pick before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21413)|
| 5:56:55| I don't think that was part of his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21415)|
| 5:56:58| He told me to bring it back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21418)|
| 5:57:00| Vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21420)|
| 5:57:01| You don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21421)|
| 5:57:05| Motion all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21425)|
| 5:57:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21427)|
| 5:57:08| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21428)|
| 5:57:10| It wasn't my marching orders again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21430)|
| 5:57:13| Three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21433)|
| 5:57:14| Five total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21434)|
| 5:57:15| Three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21435)|
| 5:57:16| Two experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21436)|
| 5:57:17| And we recommended Mr. Luthold and Mr. Ralston, but if one of them can't serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21437)|
| 5:57:20| then someone else who would have expertise in geography and drawing districts and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21440)|
| 5:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21447)|
| 5:57:29| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21449)|
| 5:57:39| Discussion regarding the matters before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21459)|
| 5:57:43| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21463)|
| 5:57:45| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21465)|
| 5:57:46| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21466)|
| 5:57:47| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21467)|
| 5:57:51| If one wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21471)|
| 5:57:52| Right, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21472)|
| 5:57:54| I guess the vice chairman, I'll briefly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21474)|
| 5:58:01| Of course, the audit committee, the real audit, they had a de facto audit committee in years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21481)|
| 5:58:06| but we have a real professional sitting audit committee now, three members of commission and two professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21486)|
| 5:58:13| We're looking at a charter, which we'll be bringing to the full commission in a meeting or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21493)|
| 5:58:18| and I'm sure one of our agenda or on our agenda with high priority will be the recent release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21498)|
| 5:58:25| recently released audit from Mr. Walsh about the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21505)|
| 5:58:29| So I'm sure that will be discussed at our next audit meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21509)|
| 5:58:32| and I think that's about just in a snapshot what we're up to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21512)|
| 5:58:37| I'm sure we'll be discussing the terms of the audit committee members at future meetings that Mr. Wright postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21517)|
| 5:58:46| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21526)|
| 5:58:48| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21528)|
| 5:58:49| I'd certainly like to hear from Mr. Saunders or Wright if they have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21529)|
| 5:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21536)|
| 5:58:57| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21537)|
| 5:58:59| I think we have a couple more discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21539)|
| 5:59:03| This is the discussion on selling Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21543)|
| 5:59:10| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21550)|
| 5:59:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21553)|
| 5:59:14| I guess most of you read my post, but I'd like to go over a few things here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21554)|
| 5:59:20| I talked to Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21560)|
| 5:59:23| He says we've got approximately $39 million in our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21563)|
| 5:59:27| We're average spending $2.5 million a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21567)|
| 5:59:32| In good times, I'd think that would be a good fund balance, but right now we're in hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21572)|
| 5:59:38| Our average natural growth last year was 8.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21578)|
| 5:59:44| I mean $8,800,000 for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21584)|
| 5:59:49| Our codes are down on fees to approximately $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21589)|
| 5:59:55| Most of that would be in building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21595)|
| 5:59:59| That means we may not have any natural growth next year to mount anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21599)|
| 6:00:04| But what's real disturbing here is we're down almost $3 million on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21604)|
| 6:00:11| Two million of this has come in the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21611)|
| 6:00:16| December of last year, we took it for December of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21616)|
| 6:00:21| This is a month behind, you've got to realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21621)|
| 6:00:24| In January, we took in $18,941,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21624)|
| 6:00:29| I know everybody has read in the paper where the department store said that they've had bad business this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21629)|
| 6:00:36| Everything's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21636)|
| 6:00:38| The state's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21638)|
| 6:00:39| You've seen what Governor Bredesen said this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21639)|
| 6:00:41| There may be 2,000 layoffs in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21641)|
| 6:00:45| Our interest on our money for this year compared to last year is down almost $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21645)|
| 6:00:56| One good thing, our property tax was up about $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21656)|
| 6:01:02| But still yet we beat that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21662)|
| 6:01:04| This interest on our money can do nothing but get less as time goes on because economic times people aren't spending money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21664)|
| 6:01:14| and as the stores reduce prices, that even brings in less revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21674)|
| 6:01:20| Our gross receipts tax, my understanding was here a few months ago I asked how much that was a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21680)|
| 6:01:27| and I was told it was approximately $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21687)|
| 6:01:31| That's based on the amount of retail sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21691)|
| 6:01:33| That's business tax to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21693)|
| 6:01:35| But in the private sector, they call it gross receipts tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21695)|
| 6:01:38| That's going to be down very significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21698)|
| 6:01:41| Our license will be down because nobody's going in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21701)|
| 6:01:47| There will not be a lot of renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21707)|
| 6:01:48| Our personal property tax will be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21708)|
| 6:01:52| But what we're really here to be concerned about, you heard Bob Cross talk about our pension fund, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21712)|
| 6:01:59| and we need to do something immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21719)|
| 6:02:01| Talk like this needs to be done by July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21721)|
| 6:02:07| Well, I have proposed and our law director has said that we should not be in the land business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21727)|
| 6:02:15| As everyone knows, I've said we shouldn't be selling our assets to pay our bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21735)|
| 6:02:21| But we're sort of in a bad situation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21741)|
| 6:02:24| There was a lot of people willing to sell it for $6 million here about three months ago and carry it for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21744)|
| 6:02:32| We've had people come forward and about halfway offer $22 million for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21752)|
| 6:02:37| My suggestion is to put it out for bids at $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21757)|
| 6:02:42| I passed a law out here showing that everybody in Medicaid and Medicare and minorities are protected by the Litton Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21762)|
| 6:02:52| I put this on a post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21772)|
| 6:02:55| The only person that responded to it was Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21775)|
| 6:02:59| He got into depth about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21779)|
| 6:03:00| And I'd like to yield the floor to him right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21780)|
| 6:03:06| Let me preface any of my comments by saying I appreciate very much what Commissioner Pinkston has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21786)|
| 6:03:15| And I'm repeating a little bit about what he said is that I'm not necessarily in favor of selling capital assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21795)|
| 6:03:22| to cover operational expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21802)|
| 6:03:24| I think that's sort of a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21804)|
| 6:03:29| It appears that we do have some financial problems with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21809)|
| 6:03:33| but we've also heard the mayor and the finance director of the county say that we might be able to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21813)|
| 6:03:43| We're also having the law director look at how much we need to put in to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21823)|
| 6:03:50| First of all, we don't know how much we're going to have to put in to keep this thing actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21830)|
| 6:03:59| It may be $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21839)|
| 6:04:00| We won't know until the first of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21840)|
| 6:04:03| There may be ways that we can structure that where we don't have to put that much in, but that's something we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21843)|
| 6:04:11| I am in favor of the county in general divesting itself of some of the real estate holdings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21851)|
| 6:04:19| The city previously was in the nursing home business, and they did the same thing a number of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21859)|
| 6:04:24| when they sold the city nursing home, and it's now a privately owned nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21864)|
| 6:04:29| There were stipulations on it that they could borrow against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21869)|
| 6:04:33| but that it needed to remain in the health care business because it was part of the old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21873)|
| 6:04:36| it was one of the wings of the old Knoxville General Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21876)|
| 6:04:39| And this is a very similar situation to what we're proposing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21879)|
| 6:04:43| That nursing home is 100% Medicaid, and the patients have a place to go, and I think it's worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21883)|
| 6:04:54| I think it's worked out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21894)|
| 6:04:57| We make a profit having a 100% Medicaid facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21897)|
| 6:05:02| I'm just going to go over a few things right now that I think that may have been misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21902)|
| 6:05:08| This was on one of my posts, but I'm going to go over it again anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21908)|
| 6:05:12| and this is what Commissioner Pinkston was alluding to just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21912)|
| 6:05:18| One perhaps misunderstanding is that Medicare does not pay for long-term nursing home care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21918)|
| 6:05:27| There is a thing called skilled nursing care, and Medicare will pay if patients qualify for 20 days of full coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21927)|
| 6:05:37| for skilled nursing home care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21937)|
| 6:05:39| After that, there is a copay of about $128 a day, which most people can't afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21939)|
| 6:05:46| and that expires completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21946)|
| 6:05:49| There's a progressive copay over the next 100 days, and after 100 days, no one's covered under Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21949)|
| 6:05:56| Medicaid is a program that indigents can have their nursing home care paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21956)|
| 6:06:03| What generally happens is that you're admitted to a nursing home, and over the course of the time that you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21963)|
| 6:06:10| you will exhaust your private financial assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21970)|
| 6:06:13| When that happens, with the help of case managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21973)|
| 6:06:17| they can complete the paperwork necessary with the state to have you declared indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21977)|
| 6:06:21| That takes about 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21981)|
| 6:06:23| So a nursing home may have about two months where they're not covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21983)|
| 6:06:27| Then the Medicaid payments will start coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21987)|
| 6:06:34| There are certain laws that regulate nursing homes very carefully on how patients are accepted, discharged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=21994)|
| 6:06:42| and how they're paid for Medicaid nursing home care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22002)|
| 6:06:47| First of all, in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22007)|
| 6:06:50| nursing homes may not refuse to accept patients because the payer is Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22010)|
| 6:06:56| In the state of Tennessee, nursing homes may not discharge Medicaid patients to make room for private pay patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22016)|
| 6:07:02| And in the state of Tennessee, nursing homes may not skip Medicaid patients on a waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22022)|
| 6:07:08| and give preference to private pay patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22028)|
| 6:07:12| And I think that the impression that many of us were left when this came up before is that if we turn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22032)|
| 6:07:19| over to a private for-profit entity, that they would be discharging Medicaid patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22039)|
| 6:07:25| that they would refuse to take Medicaid patients, and that the indigent in our community would not be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22045)|
| 6:07:36| If we are looking at selling this, I think that originally in his proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22056)|
| 6:07:43| Commissioner Pinkston had proposed that we spend no more than $10,000 or $15,000 for an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22063)|
| 6:07:50| My impression is that there's going to be a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22070)|
| 6:07:54| Since the Hillcrest issue came up, and I don't know why they were calling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22074)|
| 6:07:58| I probably had four or five out-of-state organizations contact me about the Hillcrest situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22078)|
| 6:08:07| and none of those were the people that were represented here when the discussions were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22087)|
| 6:08:11| And I don't know what the total number of entities will be that will show interest in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22091)|
| 6:08:19| but if we have five or six or seven or eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22099)|
| 6:08:22| I think the fair market value will be represented by the bids that they submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22102)|
| 6:08:28| Also, if we sell this to a private for-profit entity, not only do we get the capital up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22108)|
| 6:08:38| which we can then have the discussion as to what to do with it, but those then go on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22118)|
| 6:08:44| And I had done some calculations previously, and if this were put on the tax rolls with an assessment of $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22124)|
| 6:08:55| we would get about $215,000 a year in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22135)|
| 6:09:01| Over the course of 30 years, that's $6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22141)|
| 6:09:06| If you took the $20 million and placed that into an account, and I did this at 5% interest, you're going to receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22146)|
| 6:09:17| I have to back up here just so I give accurate numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22157)|
| 6:09:21| You'll receive about, or I'm sorry, with a return of just 3.5%, you'll get about $700,000 a year in interest on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22161)|
| 6:09:31| And if you add those two together, that's about $915,000 a year that we would get between the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22171)|
| 6:09:37| and the property taxes a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22177)|
| 6:09:39| That's pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22179)|
| 6:09:41| And over the course of 30 years, it was $47.46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22181)|
| 6:09:50| And I think those are just some of the facts that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22190)|
| 6:09:53| I know there was concern that patients would be, or that, I'm sorry, the people that work there would be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22193)|
| 6:10:00| There's no way you can run a nursing home that large by just firing everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22200)|
| 6:10:04| and hiring someone else who wouldn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22204)|
| 6:10:07| The other considerations were that the present Hillcrest management could take a certificate of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22207)|
| 6:10:13| and take their patients someplace else in town, and that is not how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22213)|
| 6:10:17| If you look on the posting that I made, I referenced that to the state organization that does the certificates of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22217)|
| 6:10:29| It's called the Tennessee Health Services and Developmental Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22229)|
| 6:10:32| and that's the regulating body for certificates of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22232)|
| 6:10:35| I'm very, very much aware about trying to transfer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22235)|
| 6:10:38| Just as a quick example, when we closed the open heart surgery program at Baptist Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22238)|
| 6:10:42| we tried to transfer it out to Baptist West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22242)|
| 6:10:45| Same organization, same certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22245)|
| 6:10:48| We couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22248)|
| 6:10:49| We had to go back and make our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22249)|
| 6:10:51| And it's the same thing when we tried to move beds from one hospital to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22251)|
| 6:10:54| We had all the certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22254)|
| 6:10:55| We own both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22255)|
| 6:10:57| You can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22257)|
| 6:10:58| You have to go back and get permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22258)|
| 6:11:00| So I think that's just some of the background information on what we have on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22260)|
| 6:11:06| and I just wanted to put some of that out there for consideration because before there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22266)|
| 6:11:14| I'm not going to say there was misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22274)|
| 6:11:16| but there was an implication that certain things would occur or certain things might occur that I think in reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22276)|
| 6:11:24| weren't quite accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22284)|
| 6:11:27| If you'll look at the law that I give, each and every one of you passed out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22287)|
| 6:11:31| you will see that minorities are covered and also women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22291)|
| 6:11:36| This is a fair way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22296)|
| 6:11:37| Matter of fact is the Supreme Court ruled on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22297)|
| 6:11:41| The United States Supreme Court ruled against the Department of Health before our laws were illegal on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22301)|
| 6:11:50| And if you have one bed where you're taking Medicaid or Medicare for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22310)|
| 6:11:54| every bed in that facility has to be certified Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22314)|
| 6:11:58| Is that not correct, Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22318)|
| 6:12:00| You know, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22320)|
| 6:12:01| Some of these things, I wouldn't take my word for it because these laws change all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22321)|
| 6:12:08| but that's my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22328)|
| 6:12:09| And I have talked to nursing home owners, and that's what they've told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22329)|
| 6:12:14| And I know also about the skilled nursing homes because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22334)|
| 6:12:17| there was an article recently in the hospital about skilled nursing care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22337)|
| 6:12:20| and there's one of them in the hospital where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22340)|
| 6:12:23| And that is the situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22343)|
| 6:12:24| You cannot discriminate on patients according to their payer, according to the payer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22344)|
| 6:12:31| One of the gentlemen that called me, I've had calls from Florida, Virginia, Kentucky, and Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22351)|
| 6:12:37| And one of the gentlemen that called me told me they'd like to have 100 percent Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22357)|
| 6:12:42| Because they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22362)|
| 6:12:43| Because that's guaranteed money from the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22363)|
| 6:12:45| Every month, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22365)|
| 6:12:46| You know, we had talked about trying to put stipulations in a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22366)|
| 6:12:50| and I think Commissioner Pinkston did this, too, and I think it was just to satisfy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22370)|
| 6:12:56| I don't think that we even need to say you need to have a certain percentage of Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22376)|
| 6:13:01| First of all, I think it's against the law to dictate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22381)|
| 6:13:05| But if you recall, the director of Hillcrest even said, she says, I have 60 open beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22385)|
| 6:13:13| I'll take 60 Medicaid patients today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22393)|
| 6:13:15| And I think any nursing home operator would tell you the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22395)|
| 6:13:19| I agree with you on that, but we do need to put a stipulation in there that it has to be a Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22399)|
| 6:13:24| Medicare certified nursing home on the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22404)|
| 6:13:27| We do need to put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22407)|
| 6:13:29| But I just put the 66 percent in there because that's the average over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22409)|
| 6:13:33| and they agreed to it at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22413)|
| 6:13:35| And I also want you to realize that we're not stopping Hillcrest from buying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22415)|
| 6:13:39| They're welcome to bid on it just like anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22419)|
| 6:13:45| Commissioner Hallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22425)|
| 6:13:47| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22427)|
| 6:13:48| I can't help being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22428)|
| 6:13:50| Commissioner Pinkson, I read your post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22430)|
| 6:13:52| It was informative and persuasive, and it did point to the dire need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22432)|
| 6:13:56| Commissioner Briggs, I read your post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22436)|
| 6:13:58| and you actually persuaded me that Certificate of Need is not a stumbling block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22438)|
| 6:14:02| and I thank you, both of you, for your posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22442)|
| 6:14:05| The only thing I have sort of lingering as a question or a doubt is the question of lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22445)|
| 6:14:10| Don't we have an existing lease, and are we breaking it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22450)|
| 6:14:14| I talked to the law director then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22454)|
| 6:14:16| There's a lease right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22456)|
| 6:14:17| The lease says that either party can break it in 60 days with a written notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22457)|
| 6:14:20| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22460)|
| 6:14:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22462)|
| 6:14:23| I talked to the law director on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22463)|
| 6:14:25| And no reason for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22465)|
| 6:14:28| Well, it was 60 days notice regardless of when it was renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22468)|
| 6:14:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22471)|
| 6:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22473)|
| 6:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22474)|
| 6:14:35| That was the one area where I was uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22475)|
| 6:14:39| Commissioner Schauf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22479)|
| 6:14:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22482)|
| 6:14:44| I agree with the economic theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22484)|
| 6:14:46| or economic principle that you don't use one-time capital infusions to pay operating credit debts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22486)|
| 6:14:58| or to fund operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22498)|
| 6:15:01| I also think we're in the worst economic situation, not just our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22501)|
| 6:15:05| but our nation in probably 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22505)|
| 6:15:08| And if we could get a substantial amount of dollars from something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22508)|
| 6:15:16| I would question why the county is in the business anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22516)|
| 6:15:18| We know a county exists to provide roads, schools, health departments, courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22518)|
| 6:15:22| But nursing homes, I mean, there's certainly a need for nursing homes in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22522)|
| 6:15:26| but there's also an industry of nursing homes and nursing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22526)|
| 6:15:31| I would expect that we will hear all these workers will be joining the unemployment rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22531)|
| 6:15:36| all these invalids will be pushed out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22536)|
| 6:15:40| I don't think I'd discount that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22540)|
| 6:15:42| I'd discount that suggestion, particularly after reading Dr. Briggs' post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22542)|
| 6:15:45| And thank you to both of you commissioners for your post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22545)|
| 6:15:48| I enjoyed reading them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22548)|
| 6:15:50| I would just be inclined to look very closely at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22550)|
| 6:15:53| Multi-millions of dollars, you know, I'm not counting those dollars yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22553)|
| 6:15:58| but they would certainly be a nice infusion to this situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22558)|
| 6:16:03| We saw these pension dollars were in the hold today, and we heard Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22563)|
| 6:16:07| or Dr. McIntyre and so forth, the dire economic situation that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22567)|
| 6:16:12| And I think we all know how realistic a tax increase is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22572)|
| 6:16:18| It's not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22578)|
| 6:16:19| So I'd be in favor of looking at this closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22579)|
| 6:16:22| It would certainly be a shot in the arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22582)|
| 6:16:24| And I'm just glad it's come to bring itself back to us, putting this back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22584)|
| 6:16:32| and having a large infusion of capital would certainly help us through this budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22592)|
| 6:16:37| And hopefully good times will come back to us again where we can just get through this bumpy road ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22597)|
| 6:16:46| Commissioner Hamlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22606)|
| 6:16:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22608)|
| 6:16:49| I think everything needs to be put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22609)|
| 6:16:51| The fact that here this evening we only had one rezoning, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22611)|
| 6:16:54| shows where we are in our community with regards to the economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22614)|
| 6:16:58| And for those of you who have been out there pounding the pavement, you know that times are extremely tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22618)|
| 6:17:02| So I'm in favor of putting everything on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22622)|
| 6:17:06| I guess I'm a little concerned about two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22626)|
| 6:17:08| One was the lease that Mr. Harmon had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22628)|
| 6:17:11| The information that was handed to us from Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22631)|
| 6:17:15| Is anyone here from Hillcrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22635)|
| 6:17:20| I'm Alan Carmichael, 400 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22640)|
| 6:17:24| I'm here representing Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22644)|
| 6:17:26| Carolyn Poynter is the CEO, of course, who's appeared before you a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22646)|
| 6:17:30| And she asked me to bring that information to the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22650)|
| 6:17:33| And I don't know if I can answer your question, but I can certainly point to the information that we left as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22653)|
| 6:17:39| that you should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22659)|
| 6:17:41| According to what you've given us, you're saying that or this document is saying that certificates of need are location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22661)|
| 6:17:49| and license specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22669)|
| 6:17:51| Certificates of need cannot be transferred or sold separately from a change or ownership in the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22671)|
| 6:17:56| I read that to say that if, indeed, we were to sell, the new company would come in and the certificates of need do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22676)|
| 6:18:02| automatically transfer to a new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22682)|
| 6:18:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22685)|
| 6:18:06| That is what that document that she asked me to provide you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22686)|
| 6:18:10| Also, it says that if, indeed, they are evicted from their building, then, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22690)|
| 6:18:16| they would have a choice to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22696)|
| 6:18:19| I mean, they could look for a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22699)|
| 6:18:21| They could bid on the new building or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22701)|
| 6:18:24| But, basically, because they don't operate the buildings and the grounds, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22704)|
| 6:18:28| they would have the opportunity, perhaps, to go somewhere or negotiate with a new company for these licenses of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22708)|
| 6:18:33| Now, would that be a, can you sell those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22713)|
| 6:18:36| Or do you have to, I would think you would have to go before the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22716)|
| 6:18:39| and the state would have some regulatory body set up to look at these certificates of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22719)|
| 6:18:44| Well, of course, I'm not the expert in this, and I appreciate what Dr. Briggs said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22724)|
| 6:18:48| But I think your question leads to the point that I think Hillcrest really wanted to make in those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22728)|
| 6:18:54| The questions about what happens when the person that has the certificate of need is not the person who owns the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22734)|
| 6:19:02| The properties are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22742)|
| 6:19:04| What happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22744)|
| 6:19:05| What happens to the certificate of need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22745)|
| 6:19:07| There are so many questions involved here that I think the time that when Hillcrest learned about this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22747)|
| 6:19:14| when we got a call from a newspaper reporter, I think, on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22754)|
| 6:19:19| So I think your leaseholder and your certificate of need holder need to be heard from before you take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22759)|
| 6:19:25| because of the very questions that you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22765)|
| 6:19:28| What are the legalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22768)|
| 6:19:29| What happens to the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22769)|
| 6:19:32| And I heard the presentation earlier on the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22772)|
| 6:19:36| You're not going to know, at least until March, and maybe even beyond that, exactly what your financial needs are in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22776)|
| 6:19:43| It seems like to me that same thing Commissioner Lambert was talking about earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22783)|
| 6:19:49| the thing that concerned him as much as it did about the redistricting was the lack of a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22789)|
| 6:19:57| I think you're leaving out a very important voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22797)|
| 6:20:00| and these are the people who for years have operated Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22800)|
| 6:20:03| and I would submit operated Hillcrest very well and taken care of those patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22803)|
| 6:20:07| that many times other people would not take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22807)|
| 6:20:10| So my position tonight, and I think I'm speaking for Hillcrest on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22810)|
| 6:20:14| is to give it some time to hear from all the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22814)|
| 6:20:17| and try and satisfy these questions, legal and otherwise, as to what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22817)|
| 6:20:21| Is Mr. Seymour the attorney for Hillcrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22821)|
| 6:20:25| Is he considered the attorney for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22825)|
| 6:20:28| This is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22828)|
| 6:20:29| Mr. Mason, who is here tonight assisting in the pension presentation, is on the board of Hillcrest and is an attorney himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22829)|
| 6:20:36| And he's been here representing with Carolyn the Hillcrest position in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22836)|
| 6:20:42| They also have in-house counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22842)|
| 6:20:44| It sounds like that might be a conflict of interest too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22844)|
| 6:20:46| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22846)|
| 6:20:47| Working for the county and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22847)|
| 6:20:50| Here's where I'm going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22850)|
| 6:20:52| It's attractive to see $22 million to come in when you're looking at the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22852)|
| 6:20:58| and you're looking at the schools, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22858)|
| 6:21:00| Some of the e-mails and phone calls I have received is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22860)|
| 6:21:04| make sure that you're not balancing the pension plan on the back of the sick and the elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22864)|
| 6:21:09| and our grandparents and so forth because there are 500 people that are our constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22869)|
| 6:21:15| And we don't hear from them because many of them can't come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22875)|
| 6:21:18| So I would like to see our law director meet with the council of Hillcrest and work out these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22878)|
| 6:21:26| and work out any potential problems that we have, report back to us next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22886)|
| 6:21:31| and if we can come to an agreement over these issues because I'm concerned about these certificates of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22891)|
| 6:21:37| And if you come back and give us a clean bill of health and say, okay, we can proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22897)|
| 6:21:42| and we're not going to end up with lawsuits and we're not going to end up with all these other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22902)|
| 6:21:46| I mean, we may end up with lawsuits anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22906)|
| 6:21:48| But I would like to know exactly where we stand on this before I vote to go ahead and pursue an RFP to sell Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22908)|
| 6:21:58| I think your concern is well-founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22918)|
| 6:22:00| As Commissioner Pinkston pointed out, this lease does have a notice provision, but timing is the key element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22920)|
| 6:22:11| You know, it's one thing to just say you send a 60-day notice and the lease is terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22931)|
| 6:22:16| but at what point in time do you send that notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22936)|
| 6:22:19| What else is in play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22939)|
| 6:22:22| You know, you've got, plus you have the, as Mr. Carmichael said, and I think it was a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22942)|
| 6:22:33| Hillcrest has operated for a long time and served the needs of the indigent population of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22953)|
| 6:22:44| Whatever this commission decides going forward is as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22964)|
| 6:22:49| This is the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22969)|
| 6:22:51| But we need to be careful that whatever action is taken that the patient population is the first consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22971)|
| 6:23:05| and that they're not placed in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22985)|
| 6:23:07| And Dr. Briggs has addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22987)|
| 6:23:10| Commissioner Pinkston, I know, has that as his first concern with the materials that he handed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22990)|
| 6:23:19| regarding the Lenten regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=22999)|
| 6:23:22| But in terms of the questions that you want me to answer, if I understand, and I want to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23002)|
| 6:23:30| you want me to report back on the certificate of need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23010)|
| 6:23:33| Well, there is a document that they've handed out that lists several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23013)|
| 6:23:37| Okay, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23017)|
| 6:23:38| And so, he'll get a copy to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23018)|
| 6:23:41| I mean, they list a lot of different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23021)|
| 6:23:44| They notice Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23024)|
| 6:23:47| They list three criteria in the need for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23027)|
| 6:23:50| And it's pretty detailed on formulas, economic feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23030)|
| 6:23:53| I mean, it's pretty detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23033)|
| 6:23:55| So that's why I'm saying that if you could take this document, get together with the council at Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23035)|
| 6:24:02| and let's look at this, and then you report back to us in February and say, okay, it's a clean bill of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23042)|
| 6:24:07| Here's what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23047)|
| 6:24:08| Here's the timing if we want to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23048)|
| 6:24:10| But also, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23050)|
| 6:24:11| I think we need to hear from Hillcrest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23051)|
| 6:24:13| But I think that we need to be very cautious in the action that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23053)|
| 6:24:17| Again, it's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23057)|
| 6:24:18| Twenty-two million dollars is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23058)|
| 6:24:20| And it would solve a lot of needs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23060)|
| 6:24:22| But we may be opening ourselves up for some issues down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23062)|
| 6:24:27| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23067)|
| 6:24:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23069)|
| 6:24:31| John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23071)|
| 6:24:39| I don't see anybody here from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23079)|
| 6:24:42| The law director just talked about timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23082)|
| 6:24:45| If we were to decide to sell these facilities, would we receive those funds in time to help us with this budget cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23085)|
| 6:24:58| It depends on how long you want to, you know, let the advertising process and the information process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23098)|
| 6:25:07| Do you want to do just a straight-up bid or do you want to make this a request for proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23107)|
| 6:25:11| And we can work through a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23111)|
| 6:25:13| But if it's the will of the commission, we can do this enough to make an impact in this budget year, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23113)|
| 6:25:22| Well, how long do you, would you recommend that we give advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23122)|
| 6:25:26| I mean, obviously, we want to get top dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23126)|
| 6:25:28| But if we're going to do this to help out the budget for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23128)|
| 6:25:35| then timing is important, that we get it done in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23135)|
| 6:25:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23138)|
| 6:25:39| And I think it's important to consider from the lessee the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23139)|
| 6:25:47| But, you know, we can get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23147)|
| 6:25:49| I mean, if this is the will of the body, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23149)|
| 6:25:54| So you do believe it can be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23154)|
| 6:25:57| Well, I think you're asking for a legal conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23157)|
| 6:25:59| I think just from a, you know, a purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23159)|
| 6:26:04| I guess let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23164)|
| 6:26:07| We need to give them 60 days, but we also need to give enough time for bids to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23167)|
| 6:26:13| And I'm sure that they're going to want information before they can make an informed bid on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23173)|
| 6:26:23| Then you're talking about they're going to probably need some time to get their financing in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23183)|
| 6:26:32| So how long, even once we, say, approve a bid that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23192)|
| 6:26:40| how much time do they normally need in order for them to close that we'd actually receive our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23200)|
| 6:26:46| Well, I mean, you could figure that it could take a month to put together a proposal to put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23206)|
| 6:26:52| You might want a month or two months in the advertising process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23212)|
| 6:26:58| And to put that out there, receive the proposals or bids, whichever you choose, and evaluate that for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23218)|
| 6:27:05| and be on the next commission's month's agenda and close the month after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23225)|
| 6:27:11| So you think that a successful bidder could come up with their money within a month's time, even once we approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23231)|
| 6:27:17| You know, I think that's got to be a part of any proposals, regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23237)|
| 6:27:22| to say that they have to close in a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23242)|
| 6:27:25| Today's credit markets are difficult, and that's just something that we would require in a bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23245)|
| 6:27:34| Do you think it's a good idea to put a minimum bid on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23254)|
| 6:27:41| Because obviously, even if we didn't put a minimum bid on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23261)|
| 6:27:45| we'd come back with whatever the best bid was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23265)|
| 6:27:48| and then this full commission would either accept it or reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23268)|
| 6:27:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23273)|
| 6:27:54| And that would be an approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23274)|
| 6:27:56| It's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23276)|
| 6:27:58| If they have a number that they just absolutely have to have, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23278)|
| 6:28:03| Or we could put it out there and say that we'll take all bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23283)|
| 6:28:06| and then just the best bid would be brought back before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23286)|
| 6:28:12| and this body could accept or reject it, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23292)|
| 6:28:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23297)|
| 6:28:21| You know, my main concern about this, and I saw the post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23301)|
| 6:28:25| and I can certainly see, you know, why we would want to consider getting out of the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23305)|
| 6:28:31| But one of my main concerns is that is this going to bring the kind of money today that it would have a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23311)|
| 6:28:39| when development was strong and credit markets were open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23319)|
| 6:28:44| And I understand this is a nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23324)|
| 6:28:47| so it lives by different economic rules than, you know, than say a traditional developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23327)|
| 6:28:54| But they still have to go to the same credit markets to get their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23334)|
| 6:28:59| And what I'm wondering is not so much of whether this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23339)|
| 6:29:03| I'm wondering if this is something that we need to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23343)|
| 6:29:07| I mean, if I found out that it was worth half now what it was two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23347)|
| 6:29:14| and that it was most likely to be worth twice as much in another two years when the market comes back, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23354)|
| 6:29:22| you know, I mean, I just, you know, look at it that I would be more inclined to hold the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23362)|
| 6:29:28| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23368)|
| 6:29:29| It's an investment that belongs to the people that we manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23369)|
| 6:29:32| And I know we can't do anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23372)|
| 6:29:36| You know, this is just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23376)|
| 6:29:38| But when this does come up to vote, one thing that I'd like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23378)|
| 6:29:42| if somebody can get this for us, is not only an estimate of what this property is worth today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23382)|
| 6:29:49| but what it was worth two years ago and what it might possibly be worth, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23389)|
| 6:29:55| when there's an economic recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23395)|
| 6:29:57| Because, you know, everything that I see for sale now is going at bargain basement prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23397)|
| 6:30:04| And I'd hate for Knox County to start selling off its assets at bargain basement prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23404)|
| 6:30:10| when if we held them for a little longer, we might get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23410)|
| 6:30:13| But in concept, I do agree, you know, that selling it's not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23413)|
| 6:30:18| I'm just worried about the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23418)|
| 6:30:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23422)|
| 6:30:26| Let me, I'll address this first, and I'll say what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23426)|
| 6:30:29| is that probably medical care is the only commodity in the country that's completely price fixed by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23429)|
| 6:30:38| And if anything, if I were a businessman and I was looking for a business that could be profitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23438)|
| 6:30:43| I would snap up something in the health care business right now because you're going to get paid, it's going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23443)|
| 6:30:48| And when economic times get better, it's not that the people are more sick then than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23448)|
| 6:30:53| That's a constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23453)|
| 6:30:55| That's given and it's almost economically independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23455)|
| 6:30:59| As far as being attractive to buy, there's probably never, if you can get the financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23459)|
| 6:31:05| there's probably not a better time to buy than now because you can get such good interest rates on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23465)|
| 6:31:11| But I can tell you Medicaid's not going to pay when we make the economic recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23471)|
| 6:31:16| There's not going to be more sick people, so you're not going to get more sick patients because we're doing economically better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23476)|
| 6:31:21| And the government's not going to pay you a whole lot more just because they're in better shape either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23481)|
| 6:31:25| It is fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23485)|
| 6:31:27| And the other point I was going to make, and it sort of addresses what Commissioner Leuthold said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23487)|
| 6:31:33| I don't think that we should count on this being an infusion to take care of as an easy out on some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23493)|
| 6:31:40| operational difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23500)|
| 6:31:43| I think that we ought to plan and I think that the mayor's office and this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23503)|
| 6:31:49| and I think we need to plan and do what we have to with our budget to take care of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23509)|
| 6:31:54| to take care of some of the sheriff's issues, to take care of these pension problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23514)|
| 6:31:58| And that's the hard work and that's not fun and that's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23518)|
| 6:32:02| But that's how we need to handle operational expenses is with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23522)|
| 6:32:07| I think there's some excellent reasons for selling this to generate capital funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23527)|
| 6:32:13| but not necessarily just as an easy out on operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23533)|
| 6:32:18| And, I mean, we can decide that once we get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23538)|
| 6:32:20| But I don't think it should be two independent decisions that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23540)|
| 6:32:28| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23548)|
| 6:32:30| Yes, I'm going to agree with you, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23550)|
| 6:32:32| You know, a year ago I was on this commission and I called for cuts and told everybody what was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23552)|
| 6:32:41| It's reached us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23561)|
| 6:32:43| Mr. Lambert, two-and-a-half months ago, maybe a little less, you were on TV wanting to sell it for six million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23563)|
| 6:32:53| So I think 22 million, I would be glad to take that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23573)|
| 6:32:57| But here's another thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23577)|
| 6:32:59| Now, on this certificate of need, does anybody here think that a businessman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23579)|
| 6:33:09| and people in the nursing business are going to step up to that podium right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23589)|
| 6:33:13| and offer $22 million for something they can't get a certificate of need for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23593)|
| 6:33:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23601)|
| 6:33:22| If you're any kind of business, they're going to cover all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23602)|
| 6:33:24| We've had people come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23604)|
| 6:33:27| They said and talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23607)|
| 6:33:29| They're going to arrange their financing and make sure they have that certificate of need before they put a bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23609)|
| 6:33:35| We may not get a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23615)|
| 6:33:37| But these people, business is run like a business, and that's what we don't run our county like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23617)|
| 6:33:42| That's what we need to start doing is running it like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23622)|
| 6:33:45| But business people are going to have their ducks in a row before they make an offer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23625)|
| 6:33:49| They're going to see that it pays and make a profit for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23629)|
| 6:33:52| Now, as an asset, selling off an asset of the counties, how is something that we're getting a dollar a year for an asset to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23632)|
| 6:34:02| How is that an asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23642)|
| 6:34:04| It's none whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23644)|
| 6:34:05| Now, you have to realize, Hillcrest out there, you say they've taken care of the patients of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23645)|
| 6:34:14| So has Shannondale and every one of these nursing homes that have Medicaid, Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23654)|
| 6:34:19| They have done business with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23659)|
| 6:34:21| They've got a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23661)|
| 6:34:23| It's just like we contract people out to more parks and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23663)|
| 6:34:27| They've got paid for everything they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23667)|
| 6:34:30| Now, these nursing homes, Dr. Briggs will attest to this, they are closely monitored by the federal government on Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23670)|
| 6:34:41| Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23681)|
| 6:34:42| I think that I showed you when we were talking about this six months, I mean a few months ago, all the deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23682)|
| 6:34:49| And you have to get them in line or they pull your certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23689)|
| 6:34:53| So these people are going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23693)|
| 6:34:56| Hillcrest got paid for their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23696)|
| 6:34:58| We have no asset, a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23698)|
| 6:35:02| This is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23702)|
| 6:35:03| Now, this is not going to solve our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23703)|
| 6:35:06| I'm asking everybody here, and I will present something by the first of the month on what I'm proposing I'm asking the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23706)|
| 6:35:16| and the finance director to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23716)|
| 6:35:18| They may not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23718)|
| 6:35:18| I didn't get anything done last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23718)|
| 6:35:20| But if you can come up with something better, come up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23720)|
| 6:35:24| But we need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23724)|
| 6:35:27| This is going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23727)|
| 6:35:28| You will find out probably we'll be $4 million in the hole, even though we had a $4 million property tax come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23728)|
| 6:35:38| four more million dollars collected than we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23738)|
| 6:35:42| There will probably be $6 million in the hole because of our sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23742)|
| 6:35:47| There's going to be no building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23747)|
| 6:35:48| There's going to be no natural growth next year to mount to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23748)|
| 6:35:52| Like I said, our business tax is going to be off, personal property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23752)|
| 6:35:56| Everything is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23756)|
| 6:35:58| You've got a governor down here that's telling now there's not going to be any raises for the state employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23758)|
| 6:36:04| I don't want any layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23764)|
| 6:36:06| We can't afford to lay people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23766)|
| 6:36:08| We can't raise taxes because people are out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23768)|
| 6:36:10| How can they pay taxes when they're out of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23770)|
| 6:36:12| There was four pages of repossessions in the paper this morning on homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23772)|
| 6:36:16| It's averaging about four pages a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23776)|
| 6:36:19| We cannot go out to these taxpayers and ask them for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23779)|
| 6:36:23| I don't want to, I said to begin with, I do not want to sell this property for this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23783)|
| 6:36:30| All we're trying to do if we sell this property is buy a little time, hoping something will turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23790)|
| 6:36:37| It's not going to solve our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23797)|
| 6:36:39| We're going to have to make cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23799)|
| 6:36:45| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23805)|
| 6:36:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23807)|
| 6:36:48| Based on what Commissioner Briggs just said, I would be more inclined to agree with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23808)|
| 6:36:55| I would still like to see the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23815)|
| 6:36:57| I'd just like to see it on paper to make, you know, it sounds like this may be a peak time to do a transaction like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23817)|
| 6:37:05| if that's one industry that hasn't been hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23825)|
| 6:37:08| And I also wanted to say thank you to my friend, Councilman Steve Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23828)|
| 6:37:13| for running his wonderful TV show on public access because you're right, Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23833)|
| 6:37:19| I did almost vote to sell it for $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23839)|
| 6:37:23| And fortunately, I said it on the air where some folks heard me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23843)|
| 6:37:29| and could talk some sense into me before we made the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23849)|
| 6:37:34| Do you want me to tell you what I told my wife when you made that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23854)|
| 6:37:37| Go ahead, we're having fun tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23857)|
| 6:37:41| I said, there's an idiot who don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23861)|
| 6:37:44| And I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23864)|
| 6:37:45| And thankfully, I said it on the air and there were some folks that showed me what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23865)|
| 6:37:51| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23871)|
| 6:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23873)|
| 6:37:54| I want to agree with Commissioner Pinkston in that we need to run this like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23874)|
| 6:37:59| And the first thing that you do in a business is when you have something of this magnitude is you get your lawyers involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23879)|
| 6:38:05| And you say, look at this, bring us back, let us know what's legal, what's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23885)|
| 6:38:10| And that's exactly what I'm suggesting is let's let the lawyers delve into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23890)|
| 6:38:15| look at these questions on all these pages, get together with their counsel, come back, Hillcrest comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23895)|
| 6:38:21| you've got your report, do we need a resolution to do that or will you do that just because we've asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23901)|
| 6:38:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23906)|
| 6:38:27| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23907)|
| 6:38:28| Well, I would like to make that formal request and just have you look into it and get together with their counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23908)|
| 6:38:33| and report back to us at the February meeting, perhaps intergovernmental and finance, if you can do it that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23913)|
| 6:38:38| And I think that we need to go ahead and pursue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23918)|
| 6:38:41| And then this gives Hillcrest a chance to come and appear before us at our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23921)|
| 6:38:45| I think he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23925)|
| 6:38:46| We pay him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23926)|
| 6:38:48| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23928)|
| 6:38:50| I'm grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23930)|
| 6:38:51| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23931)|
| 6:38:52| Oh, this is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23932)|
| 6:38:53| I'm sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23933)|
| 6:38:56| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23936)|
| 6:38:58| We've got two more discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23938)|
| 6:39:01| We've got a discussion regarding liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23941)|
| 6:39:08| Are we going to place an order or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23948)|
| 6:39:12| I'll order a double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23952)|
| 6:39:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23955)|
| 6:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23956)|
| 6:39:17| Commissioners, it's been stated publicly from Senator Woodson and Senator Tim Burchett for us to introduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23957)|
| 6:39:22| that they want to introduce legislation at the state level to uphold the referendum adopted by the voters in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23962)|
| 6:39:30| in unincorporated areas to have liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23970)|
| 6:39:33| But they need that coming from us as a body, and it was passed by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23973)|
| 6:39:38| And, Mr. Law Director, I don't know if that needs to come from me individually or from our commissioner, our chairperson or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23978)|
| 6:39:46| Who do you think it should come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23986)|
| 6:39:48| I think what the senators are asking for is a vote by this body asking them to proceed in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=23988)|
| 6:40:00| And I think that could come in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24000)|
| 6:40:09| So is that something that we could move to add to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24009)|
| 6:40:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24013)|
| 6:40:14| And just get that done tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24014)|
| 6:40:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24015)|
| 6:40:16| I'd make a motion to add it to the agenda, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24016)|
| 6:40:19| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24019)|
| 6:40:21| I need two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24021)|
| 6:40:25| Of what number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24025)|
| 6:40:28| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24028)|
| 6:40:31| We need 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24031)|
| 6:40:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24032)|
| 6:40:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24034)|

| 6:40:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24048)|
| 6:40:49| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24049)|
| 6:40:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24050)|
| 6:40:51| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24051)|
| 6:40:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24052)|
| 6:40:53| Commissioner Luto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24053)|
| 6:40:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24054)|
| 6:40:55| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24055)|
| 6:40:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24056)|
| 6:40:57| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24057)|
| 6:40:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24058)|
| 6:40:59| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24059)|
| 6:41:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24060)|
| 6:41:01| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24061)|
| 6:41:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24062)|
| 6:41:03| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24063)|
| 6:41:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24064)|
| 6:41:05| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24065)|
| 6:41:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24066)|
| 6:41:07| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24067)|
| 6:41:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24068)|
| 6:41:09| We got him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24069)|
| 6:41:13| Fifteen-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24073)|
| 6:41:14| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24074)|
| 6:41:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24075)|
| 6:41:16| Then I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24076)|
| 6:41:17| Fifteen yes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24077)|
| 6:41:22| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion that we let the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24082)|
| 6:41:25| Does it need to come from the law department or does it need to come from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24085)|
| 6:41:27| We can ask the law department if they will assist us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24087)|
| 6:41:33| I think it would be more appropriate to be a letter, depending on what the vote is, from your chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24093)|
| 6:41:40| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24100)|
| 6:41:41| Drafted by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24101)|
| 6:41:43| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24103)|
| 6:41:44| I'll place that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24104)|
| 6:41:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24106)|
| 6:41:48| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24108)|
| 6:41:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24109)|
| 6:41:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24111)|
| 6:41:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24112)|
| 6:41:53| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24113)|
| 6:41:54| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24114)|
| 6:41:55| It's got a line on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24115)|
| 6:41:56| Strike me from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24116)|
| 6:41:58| I didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24118)|
| 6:41:59| I actually, you know, I know when I'm beat, but I just wanted to say that while I have nothing against an adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24119)|
| 6:42:07| beverage now and then, I do believe that it's best if they're kept in incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24127)|
| 6:42:12| There's a higher concentration of law enforcement in cities incorporated areas to handle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24132)|
| 6:42:19| and that's why I oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24139)|
| 6:42:21| It's nothing against alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24141)|
| 6:42:22| It's just that I think it needs to be in incorporated areas in cities where it's law enforcement is more heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24142)|
| 6:42:29| concentrated to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24149)|
| 6:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24154)|
| 6:42:35| We have one more discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24155)|
| 6:42:37| Discussion on the chancellery ruling on the subway issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24157)|
| 6:42:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24165)|
| 6:42:46| Yeah, I was the one that asked this to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24166)|
| 6:42:49| If I recall, when we reviewed and then approved the contract with Natural Resources Recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24169)|
| 6:42:56| and I don't want to put him on the spot, but I believe it was Commissioner Wright that made the motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24176)|
| 6:43:01| we delay considering that until we had a ruling from chancellery court, and I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24181)|
| 6:43:08| But then after discussion with the law director at that time, and he told us correctly that he thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24188)|
| 6:43:19| would be more than just a few weeks before that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24199)|
| 6:43:21| I think it ended up being about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24201)|
| 6:43:24| But part of our approval of that contract was on the basis of what this ruling that Judge Weaver came down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24204)|
| 6:43:35| with just a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24215)|
| 6:43:39| And I'm going to read some of the statements from the document that he issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24219)|
| 6:43:43| And one was that the closeness of the relationship between the county and the defendants warrants scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24223)|
| 6:43:48| Likewise, the Department of Engineering and Public Works should be investigated from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24228)|
| 6:43:53| without reliance upon the department being investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24233)|
| 6:43:58| Also, the statement was made that the county's payment of a false claim, the Matthews grinding bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24238)|
| 6:44:06| as well as the defendant's withholding of $311,000 of revenue sharing fees owed the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24246)|
| 6:44:11| were an outside investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24251)|
| 6:44:13| And I won't go through the whole thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24253)|
| 6:44:15| But since we had approved that contract, depending upon the judge's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24255)|
| 6:44:22| And the judge indicates that we should probably have outside investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24262)|
| 6:44:29| He mentioned several times it appears to be warranted upon this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24269)|
| 6:44:33| It seems to me there's a lot of new questions asked about the contract and the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24273)|
| 6:44:38| And I, as a body, do we desire to bring this back up for discussion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24278)|
| 6:44:45| Because we were told at the time that we should go ahead and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24285)|
| 6:44:48| That was our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24288)|
| 6:44:51| And we were also told that if there was an adverse ruling in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24291)|
| 6:44:56| and maybe this could be interpreted in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24296)|
| 6:45:01| that we would have the opportunity to look at that contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24301)|
| 6:45:07| I'd like to ask our law director to weigh in on this, if he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24307)|
| 6:45:12| I understand your concerns, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24312)|
| 6:45:16| And the statements that you just read, of course, are public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24316)|
| 6:45:20| And they're contained in the memorandum opinion issued by the learned chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24320)|
| 6:45:26| I would request, however, that this body refrain from taking any action tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24326)|
| 6:45:36| or discussing this further at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24336)|
| 6:45:40| My reason for asking that is this matter is still pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24340)|
| 6:45:48| And my office has met with and discussed this with all parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24348)|
| 6:45:57| And I anticipate taking action shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24357)|
| 6:46:04| Now, what you're discussing in terms of the contract was a contract that was entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24364)|
| 6:46:09| as a result of a mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24369)|
| 6:46:13| And there are some questions that need to be answered regarding that mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24373)|
| 6:46:22| And I intend to try to get those answered in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24382)|
| 6:46:29| As regards to the other issues that you mentioned, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24389)|
| 6:46:35| those will also be addressed in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24395)|
| 6:46:39| But I don't think it would be appropriate for them to be bandied about tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24399)|
| 6:46:47| simply because this case is still pending before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24407)|
| 6:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24415)|
| 6:46:56| Commissioner Pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24416)|
| 6:46:57| Oh, I'm sorry, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24417)|
| 6:46:58| I thought you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24418)|
| 6:47:00| My name is Bradley Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24420)|
| 6:47:01| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24421)|
| 6:47:06| And respectfully, I agree 100% with Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24426)|
| 6:47:10| I think that we would be putting the cart before the horse if we were to jump out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24430)|
| 6:47:14| and cancel a contract before we had a final ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24434)|
| 6:47:19| I've came here tonight because I have seen a few things out here on the web that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24439)|
| 6:47:26| Now, when I see something I don't think is right, you all know I'll come here and tell you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24446)|
| 6:47:31| And that is true whether it's against my side or for the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24451)|
| 6:47:35| regardless if it's right, it's right, if it's wrong, it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24455)|
| 6:47:38| There have been some people on the net that have promoted theories that certain members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24458)|
| 6:47:45| of the county government's wife was involved in the cover-up or a cover-up if one did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24465)|
| 6:47:51| I do not adopt those views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24471)|
| 6:47:53| I do not share those views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24473)|
| 6:47:54| I do not think that any department head's wife had anything to do with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24474)|
| 6:47:58| So I wanted to say that in all fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24478)|
| 6:48:02| I don't think that that would be a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24482)|
| 6:48:04| The one thing that I would like to say out of prudence for the taxpayers is that I feel that we have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24484)|
| 6:48:19| where allegedly they may have substantial sums of our money which I have claimed for a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24499)|
| 6:48:27| I do not know if any performance bond is active with this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24507)|
| 6:48:34| I feel that if there's any way, and I may be speaking out of terms here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24514)|
| 6:48:38| but if any way we could institute a performance bond of $400,000 or $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24518)|
| 6:48:45| for this contractor to put up while they continue to operate our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24525)|
| 6:48:49| while we continue to send them money every month, we write them a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24529)|
| 6:48:54| While we are doing that, I feel that if there was any way that this body could institute a performance bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24534)|
| 6:48:59| of $400,000 or $500,000, that that would be a prudent exercise on behalf of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24539)|
| 6:49:07| simply because if I successfully take this throughout the legal proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24547)|
| 6:49:11| and collect the money for the taxpayers, nothing prevents a hypothetical bankruptcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24551)|
| 6:49:17| and go back to Louisiana and leave us holding the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24557)|
| 6:49:21| If they want to continue to operate on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24561)|
| 6:49:24| I do not feel that it is unfair to ask them to put up a performance bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24564)|
| 6:49:28| that could at least offset a percentage of the potential judgment involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24568)|
| 6:49:33| I'm not here to throw allegations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24573)|
| 6:49:36| I'm not here to do anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24576)|
| 6:49:38| I'm just trying to say this would be prudent to look out for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24578)|
| 6:49:43| We're talking about a large sum of money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24583)|
| 6:49:46| Some of the totals in this litigation are over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24586)|
| 6:49:51| I would submit to you that I have strong evidence that it might top $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24591)|
| 6:49:56| to allow them to continue to use our property while we pay them money every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24596)|
| 6:50:01| without a performance bond with these types of substantial figures outstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24601)|
| 6:50:07| I feel would not be prudent upon the county government at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24607)|
| 6:50:12| On a side note, and maybe I shouldn't say this, but, you know, for the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24612)|
| 6:50:21| I've been painted as a nut, as someone who has been completely disconnected from reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24621)|
| 6:50:31| I've repeatedly came to this body months after I came to the department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24631)|
| 6:50:40| trying to get this situation resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24640)|
| 6:50:44| I filed this litigation as a last option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24644)|
| 6:50:50| I filed it because I thought I was doing what I should do as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24650)|
| 6:50:57| I've been embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24657)|
| 6:50:59| I've been humiliated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24659)|
| 6:51:01| I've been made out to be a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24661)|
| 6:51:04| People have sent e-mails from abradatplumcreek.com to the attorneys involved in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24664)|
| 6:51:09| and that's not my e-mail address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24669)|
| 6:51:12| They were very derogatory towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24672)|
| 6:51:16| I have been made out to be disingenuous, a fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24676)|
| 6:51:23| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24683)|
| 6:51:25| The only thing it's done is made me fight harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24685)|
| 6:51:29| I've learned a lesson in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24689)|
| 6:51:32| Sometimes performing your civic duty is a lot more than donating your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24692)|
| 6:51:39| Sometimes you have to donate your reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24699)|
| 6:51:44| I feel that this judgment has vindicated me as a person and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24704)|
| 6:51:50| I've tried to do what was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24710)|
| 6:51:54| I'm not going to comment on the particulars in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24714)|
| 6:51:57| but I will tell you it is my opinion that the evidence is overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24717)|
| 6:52:03| The only thing that I hope is that we can get this resolved in a way that was fair to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24723)|
| 6:52:09| which was my ultimate goal when I filed this litigation at my expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24729)|
| 6:52:15| My expenses have not been nowhere near as much as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24735)|
| 6:52:19| You all have expended over $100,000 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24739)|
| 6:52:24| And some would theorize in an attempt to derail the county's ability to collect these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24744)|
| 6:52:31| The contractor has expended, I would surmise, at least $100,000 in attorney's expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24751)|
| 6:52:38| So when I compare that the opposite party has spent probably in excess of $200 to a quarter million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24758)|
| 6:52:45| fighting off my meager $20,000 legal budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24765)|
| 6:52:51| I have to feel like that statement in that situation speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24771)|
| 6:52:58| Because the reason that speaks so much volumes is the truth is cheaper to litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24778)|
| 6:53:06| And I litigated the truth with 10% of the finances that they had to litigate their side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24786)|
| 6:53:12| I hope that we can collect this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24792)|
| 6:53:17| I hope that the statements made by your department heads have not sabotaged this case beyond repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24797)|
| 6:53:22| Brad, you've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24802)|
| 6:53:24| But I do believe that I have sufficient evidence that if I have the proper support from my county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24804)|
| 6:53:30| I can collect for you all substantial sums of money from this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24810)|
| 6:53:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24815)|
| 6:53:38| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24818)|
| 6:53:40| Yes, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24820)|
| 6:53:41| Do we have the authority to ask for a performance bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24821)|
| 6:53:47| Well, I mean, do we have to require it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24827)|
| 6:53:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24830)|
| 6:53:51| There is a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24831)|
| 6:53:55| If that contract does not include a performance bond, then it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24835)|
| 6:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24841)|
| 6:54:04| I would like to observe something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24844)|
| 6:54:06| The ruling that was just handed down was not a ruling on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24846)|
| 6:54:12| It was not dispositive of the entire case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24852)|
| 6:54:15| The ruling involved a motion to dismiss the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24855)|
| 6:54:21| And there are certain legal standards that the court applies in ruling on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24861)|
| 6:54:25| The court denied the motion to dismiss, but observed in the memorandum opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24865)|
| 6:54:33| that the defense had not yet had an opportunity to put on its proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24873)|
| 6:54:37| So I just, you know, make that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24877)|
| 6:54:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24885)|
| 6:54:46| Brad, I just want to tell you just real quick, I appreciate what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24886)|
| 6:54:50| the years that you've been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24890)|
| 6:54:52| You know, and I've told you in the meetings before, Brad, be quiet, be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24892)|
| 6:54:56| You're going for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24896)|
| 6:54:58| Say what you need for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24898)|
| 6:55:00| You know, I think a lot of us here are with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24900)|
| 6:55:03| We follow what's in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24903)|
| 6:55:05| I read every word of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24905)|
| 6:55:07| We're following how it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24907)|
| 6:55:08| So, you know, I wish you luck on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24908)|
| 6:55:11| And we're watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24911)|
| 6:55:14| If I may briefly respond to one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24914)|
| 6:55:17| There's also been a lot of people on the Internet and in the blogs that have laid blame on particular commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24917)|
| 6:55:24| or they want to say they want to lay blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24924)|
| 6:55:26| They've even laid blame on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24926)|
| 6:55:28| He's been with me 100 percent since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24928)|
| 6:55:30| I just wanted to say for the folks that watch me on these public forums that's got spare time to kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24930)|
| 6:55:37| for these silly things, people have to keep in mind that a lot of these commissioners were given inaccurate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24937)|
| 6:55:46| by the people they should have been able to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24946)|
| 6:55:51| Or maybe I should recant that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24951)|
| 6:55:53| But a lot of commissioners were given inaccurate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24953)|
| 6:55:56| and they had to make a decision on the information they were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24956)|
| 6:56:02| That's the way it always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24962)|
| 6:56:04| That's the way it always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24964)|
| 6:56:05| If there's nothing else, I'll entertain a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24965)|
| 6:56:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24968)|
| 6:56:11| Commissioners, I want to mention one thing real quick, that in the 7th District we're holding a quarterly commissioners'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24971)|

| 6:56:22| It was in some papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24982)|
| 6:56:24| I'd like to introduce our new commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=24984)|
