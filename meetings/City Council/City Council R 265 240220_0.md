| 0:11:14| This is a unique variance request and I hope everybody did have a chance to review my letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| because I think, you know, it sets out the kind of the procedural history and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| the uniqueness of this request as well as I think it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| This is essentially a request for these seven lots that are on two little stub-out properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| to the main parcel, main overall parcel, to switch the front and rear setbacks with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| side setbacks, allowing us to reorient the lot so we can create driveway patterns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| are straight and organized and safer for the community and for our emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| And the reason this variance is required is the strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| are these variances, are these lots have to be served by a shared permanent access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| or a spay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Essentially, a common driveway that up to five lots can share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Under the city's interpretation, the spay or these common driveways are not considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| And the zoning ordinance requires all buildings to face a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| And so for this property, and of course you have the maps, in order to be able to face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| a street, it either has to face internal to the larger parcel where the streets are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| to be dedicated as city streets or they have to face out towards Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| And that, because of the pie shape of the lot and the topography, creates this weird| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| pattern where to be able to face either towards the internal or towards the external, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| roads have to serpentine around in order to access them for driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| So it's really an unintended consequence of a strict interpretation of what the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| This was denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals by a vote of three to one, and there was opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| And I think the opposition focused on, you know, overall the development and the perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| or the misperception that this was really about acquiring additional density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Planning Commission approved two different concepts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| One for 66 lots that did not need any variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| One for 67 lots with the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| We have since gone back and been able to reorient our plan for the one without the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| variances, and we can get 67 lots on that, and that can go through and be approved administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So it's not about trying to squeeze one extra lot in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| It's really trying to create a traffic pattern that is organized and safe, and it gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| flexibility to work with the neighbors that are adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| And we have Ms. Moore, who will speak, I think, briefly on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| She is the one that's most directly affected by this, and we were able to work with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| and deal with some potential encroachments that her property had in ours with a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and a retaining wall and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And with these variances give us the flexibility to be able to keep that without there being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| any conflict and give some additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| So this is one where it meets the criteria for hardships because we are dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| something of an exceptional odd-shaped lot, and there are also some topography issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| and our engineer laid out the topography concerns on page 201 and 202 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| And I outlined all the different criteria that we have to look at, but I think ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| we're looking at this observes the spirit of the ordinance and granting the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| substantial justice would be done in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| It just would give everyone a chance for a traffic pattern for our future residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| for our neighbors, for the city's employees that may have to access the roads, just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| cleaner, safer access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| So with that, I would ask that you approve the variance for all seven lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| I'm happy to answer questions, as is Mr. Huber is here to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Next person signed up to speak on this appeal is Yvette Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Ms. Moore, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Yvette Moore, 1813 Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| We're directly next to 1817.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| After meeting with Mr. Huber and the surveyors and discussing the lot and understanding more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| of the variance and what needs to be done, I no longer appeal this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| I ask for it to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Once again, talking with them, talking about the buffers and understanding more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| layout and how it would be approached now, we are in agreeance with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| I don't need five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| The third and final speaker signed up on this is Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Mr. Huber, if you could state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| John Huber, Huber Properties, 213 Fox Road, 37922 West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Yeah, just to give you a little color, we've been working on this probably since 2021 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| have had the opportunity to work with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| We do have an approved concept plan currently available for the property that will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| up to 67 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| The variance request will actually allow us to, as Mr. Mullen said, orient the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| in a way that I, in my opinion, in my engineer's opinion, that will be much safer, much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| easily understood, actually reduce the impervious area for it, and actually increase the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| between the neighboring houses and the new houses that will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| So that was one of the big things that we talked about with Ms. Moore, was increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| up to 70 feet or so between her lot line and the house, which in the original plan, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| asked for five feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| So again, we just would appreciate an approval so we could help buffer the neighbors even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| more with the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Council members, there's no one signed up to speak in opposition to this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Mr. Huber, I have a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| One, I'm really glad everybody worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| That is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| The 75 feet, 70 feet setback, is that another process that you need to go through, or did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| you already go through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| We are looking into that now, but the variances, if they are approved today, we believe will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| allow us to do that, to allow that buffer up to 70 feet between the property line, common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| property line and the edge of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| If there is a scenario, we could potentially have to come back through and ask for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| variance to clean it up effectively, but we believe that the variances, the seven variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| we've requested today should cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| What are you thinking you might need a variance for again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| It would be similar, just the same variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| There's been so many different iterations of this layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| It has changed and lot numbers have changed and things like that, so I'd like to reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| the right to go back and talk to city engineering and planning commission staff to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| that we have the right lot numbers and the right variance requests for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| That's the only thing that could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| All it would be was, again, the front and rear setbacks reduced to five feet, but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| at that point, the side setbacks become 20 feet and 25 feet since we're just rotating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| the building, but that's the only thing that we would ever ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| You have to go to planning to make that, where you change the configuration that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| the 70 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| We'll take that back through staff request for them to review and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| I just want to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| I'm trusting you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| I actually formed an email and sent it to Ms. Moore with that plan that we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| about, emailed it to her and detailed all the changes that we are planning on requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| staff to approve with the approval of the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| I am in favor of this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| I think mainly what it does is just clean up the configuration of the driveways and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| actually makes things safer so that everyone's not coming out onto Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Mr. Huber, I'm just trying to understand the diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| I have no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Which way do the doors point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Are the doors, you're going with this layout, the bottom one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| I know you probably can't see, but it's your two, the variance that you need gives you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| this layout down here where everything's in line versus up here where it looks like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| Dr. Seuss Village maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| No offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I don't know how else to describe it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Anyway, are these people's doors facing this lot here or are they facing the railroad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| These will be facing the lower lot away from the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Refresh my memory because it was 2021 when we voted on your rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| If I recall, was it RN-2 or RN-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| So these are single family, not duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| They're single family, detached, not duplex style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| But was that one of the conversations back then was possibly duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| It actually started out as multifamily and RN-5 was the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| I met with the neighbors and they had some discomfort with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| So we backed it up to a RN-2 request but made it known to the neighbors that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| hoping to do some affordable housing with duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Again, through the meeting with the neighbors, they came back and said we really would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| to have single family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| So we backed up again, created a single family detached subdivision, and here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| And so I know you're probably a little ways out, but do you know what the price points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| are going to end up being or what the square footage is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| I guess the market will dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| But I mean, we're probably in that 300 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| We're trying to do everything we can do to keep it as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Because they're not subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| They're just, okay, you're just trying to value engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| The original plan that we had talked about would have been a subsidy through THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| But, you know, again, working with the neighbors, they didn't want that in the area, so we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| it to the single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| I appreciate the refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Just one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| There's two sets, and I'm looking at page 170, or I'm not sure what page this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| The one I have is from Mr. Mullen's letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| It says page three of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And there's exhibit A and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| And you've got lots 24, 25, 26, and 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| That one, those do face the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Now, if you flip to the page...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Oh, those were the ones I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| That's why I wanted to make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| So you've got 24, lots 30, 31, 32, and 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| On the bottom, those face away, so I just wanted to make sure you understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Oh, because we're discussing the ones...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| There's all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| The ones that exit to Francis, and then there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| But the only ones that you're changing on the concept plan, like A and C, the only difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| are these ones up here backed up to the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| That's on those, but there's a total...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| There's two different areas that we're asking for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Oh, I see it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| One faces the railroad track, one faces away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I just wanted to make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1398)|

| 0:23:22| Mr. Huber, just for a reminder for people who are paying attention to this, how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| units are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| You're creating detached single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1409)|

| 0:23:48| willing to work with the community on a project that will, you know, fit the area, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| just be more amenable to what that neighborhood was hoping would come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1437)|
| 0:24:05| I'm actually really surprised, but I'm very happily surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| And I think it sets a good...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| I think you have a good reputation, but it furthers that reputation for many in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| when we see that willingness to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1460)|

| 0:24:31| So, I've just, for my own...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| When you were talking about doing a duplex, Councilman Roberto asked, this is 67 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| How many units would there benefit if you'd done duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| I think we were somewhere between 100 and 110 is where that plan landed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1492)|

| 0:29:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| I'm Isaac Thorne, Director of Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I just want to give you an overview of microtransit or on-demand services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| So what that is is customers could use their we're working with transit app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| So customers can use the transit app on their phone to book trips where then we would dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| a vehicle out to their location, centralized location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| We pick them up and drop them off the nearest fixed route bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| They can also, if they don't have a smart phone, they can also call our dispatch office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| and schedule that trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| But this is, we're trying to deploy this in an area where it's low income, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| have access to transit at all right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So that's where we're looking to deploy this type of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1830)|

| 0:31:35| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| There's a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Ms. Tina Sparks has signed up to speak in opposition to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Ms. Sparks, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1905)|

| 0:31:49| Council members, any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Oh, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| I can ask the question because Ms. Tina did ask me the question, and I didn't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| Her concern was around what does our investment look like in terms of mental health support for KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1923)|
| 0:32:16| Is this separate from the chaplain program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Is it replacing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Is it supplementing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I think just some more details about our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Chief Noel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| So this is a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| So we have our chaplain program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| We have our in-house peer support program, which is in-house peer support employees who exist to come out and help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1950)|
| 0:32:40| In fact, we did this in the response of Deputy McGowan's death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Our internal peer support team really sprang into action, was able to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| And this is a supplement on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| So we applied for the law enforcement mental health and wellness grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| And so this is going to allow us to be able to bring Brooke in for about 16 hours a week for the next two years to be able to provide in-house sessions if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1975)|
| 0:33:06| So it's an enhancement on top of everything else that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Just a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Is there more intensive counseling that people can do at the department rather than having to leave to get the mental health support, and probably with someone who understands policing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=1996)|
| 0:33:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| So she really specializes in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| You know, this is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| So if somebody wants to get mental health services outside of the workplace, they could go through the city or the health insurance or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| But we're able, in-house, to sit down and talk to people while they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2031)|

| 0:35:23| Okay, there's, I think, a couple people signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| There are three people here to speak in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2129)|

| 0:35:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Okay, there's three people, there's four people signed up to speak in favor and three to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| We'll start with the three in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| First is Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| All right, Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas, Knoxville, Mechanicsville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| So this proposal has started many, many months ago, utilizing a provision of the zoning code that was enacted by a prior council, but still on the books, allowing me as a private citizen to bring this forward to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2163)|
| 0:36:16| I had its first bite at the apple in front of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Unfortunately, planning did not see fit to give it much attention and kind of sidestepped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| No, this one, actually, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| The commission itself kind of surprised everyone in the last minute from the meeting, made some changes, and pushed it on to you guys, along with the others that they didn't address that I appealed and brought to you, which I believe that was September, October, maybe September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2186)|
| 0:36:43| August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| You guys sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I wanted it to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I wanted more robust review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| This time, planning did give it some attention, and commission, once again, made some changes to what I suggested, but approved it and sent it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| I postponed it to allow the mayor's proposal for missing middle housing to go and be sure that these were not conflated or confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| Now, it's time for this one to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| What we have before us is not sufficient, in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| I still believe we would have challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| As somebody who's building these and has built them, I believe that the lot size minimum is a huge obstacle to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| You would also remember that Opticose told us that lot size minimums is a poor way to regulate zoning and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2249)|
| 0:37:39| The parking is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Again, Opticose tells us that parking is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I'll note that the first time planning reviewed this and sent it to you, they removed parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| I don't know, maybe just apathy by the second time they had to do it, but it stayed in there this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| The height is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| The height restriction creates a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| 18 feet is kind of arbitrarily picked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| I've talked to Lindsay Crockett and Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| They intended to prevent a two-story ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I think that, once again, we paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to listen to Opticose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| They said, you know, you really should be regulating stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| If we don't want two-story ADUs, let's go to story and a half, the language that we used in the missing middle program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| which would allow us some flexibility so that if we need, because of the structural framing elements to ensure the building is built safely and has fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| maybe we need to be 20.3 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I think that's an example from a real-world case where someone wanted to build one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| and they couldn't because, at the end of the day, it was calculated to be 20.2 or 20.3 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| So, a few modifications, I think, are in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| but I will stress that it's not only me that has suggested the owner-occupant restriction be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| and I actually offered, as a compromise in a consultation with Mr. Roberto and many of his constituents' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2339)|
| 0:39:07| to try to limit this to the TDR, to bring this as a companion piece to missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| because, if all of you recall, Opticose talks about ADUs as part of missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| particularly in conjunction with the types that have been passed in the missing middle housing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| duplex stack, duplex side-by-side, triplex, and fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Each one of those types is suited for an ADU, according to Opticose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| who is the preeminent national expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So, I would urge you to seriously consider a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| consider making the amendments to reflect something more along what I originally proposed to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| the green and red-lined version that's in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| And, if any of you don't have this book, I'll be happy to get copies of this book provided to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| because you will see that my version directly takes, and I cite to, Opticose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| So, this is not just me. This is backed by a body of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| And, I just want to use the last minute I have, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| The obstacle to affordable housing is our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| That is bared out through countless studies the nation over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And who can change our zoning code? The nine of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| How did we get here? The previous nine that sat before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| How are we going to get out of this? The votes of the nine of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| You don't need the mayor to propose it. The mayor can't even veto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| You guys have the authority to change our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| By state law, it's got to go through planning as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| but planning is showing that they are very receptive to making some very bold changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| I challenge you all to find some boldness and take courage to represent everyone in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| because the majority of the city are renters and they're struggling to afford their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you. The next person signed up to speak in favor of this is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Mr. Bartholomew, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2462)|
| 0:41:18| You all should have a... Will, will you hand it out, please? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2478)|
| 0:41:28| Here's a map that I want to share with you. Sorry. Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| This is a map I want to share with you. This is the red line map from the 40s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| and I believe we can all agree that what it stands for is an abomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| Tonight, we're debating housing that if left on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| will continue the policies we can all agree are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And if you will, please let me explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Knoxville's median household income is $45,700, and the median rent is $1,700 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| This means that 45% of people's income is being used just to pay the rent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| Can you believe that? I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| It's a math problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| When it costs $300,000 plus to build a one-bedroom apartment, you cannot make it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| The last project we approved cost over $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| and the developer got the land for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| We must figure out how to lower our per-unit cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| ADUs do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| A typical ADU will cost around $100,000 to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| This means that with normal returns, it could be rented for around $800 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| This is half of the median rental rate here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| and $200 per month lower than the fair market rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| If you want to prevent gentrification, then allow affordable units to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| that help people stay in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| This is one of the main reasons that AARP is a supporter of ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Gentrification increases when housing supply is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| ADUs use existing infrastructure and land to build more affordably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| and this gives our aging population a way to do it in place with dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Now, perhaps the most controversial piece of ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| and that's the owner-occupant requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Owner-occupancy requirements thwart investment in ADUs for homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2583)|

| 0:44:15| we are clearly discriminating against renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| The owner-occupancy requirement is phrased as increasing safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2658)|

| 0:44:45| Owner-occupancy requirement has one goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| and that's to prevent ADUs from being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Now to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Green stood for best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Blue was still desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| Yellow definitely declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| And red is hazardous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Any area that you see yellow as red is where African-Americans lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Let me say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Any area on this map that you see in yellow and red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| is where African-Americans lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| No areas that are blue or green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2712)|

| 0:45:23| Sounds familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| However, African-Americans were not the only ones discriminated against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| but also the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| It was used to determine where financing can be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| That also sounds familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| A method of limiting financing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| and justifying it by arguing safety and character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| the owner-occupancy requirement for ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| does exactly what the redlining maps did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| When you legalize discrimination against renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| you're continuing the same points of redlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| The owner-occupancy requirement clearly discriminates against renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| We now have more renters than homeowners in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| I do not understand why we would continue to advance a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| based on fear of what a renter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I think it's time to ask the neighborhood advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| why the same opportunity afforded to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| should not be afforded to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2768)|

| 0:46:14| It's my hope we will vote yes today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| on removing the archaic and discriminatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| owner-occupancy requirement for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2779)|

| 0:46:31| Mr. Durham, you can start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Dustin Durham, 114 Cornelia Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| apartment 237917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I want to start by thanking some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I want to thank Mr. Marlowe for his persistence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| in pushing for more housing in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| and for the needed changes to our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| that are holding us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| and directly causing this housing crisis to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| I want to thank the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| for passing Mr. Marlowe's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| though not all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| to include the removal of the owner-occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| setback requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| and the maximum gross floor area requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And I want to thank you, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| for your continued work in attempting to fix this crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| and build a Knoxville based on inclusivity and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And while I support far more being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| especially in regards to ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| for example, the total removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| of an off-street parking requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| I understand that change can be worrisome for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| and that often progress happens in increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| In the future, I'm sure we will revisit ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| and the related codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| as one of many tactics to provide more housing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| just like how missing middle won't solve everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| nor will ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| But both are critical to add housing supply to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| both for renters as well as homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| So with the existing text that you are voting on in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| I want to speak on what is the main point of contention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| the owner-occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I fully and passionately support the removal of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Not only does this requirement prevent many locals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| from adding ADUs to properties they own but don't reside at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| but the reality has been said many times before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| is that this crisis is just an issue of supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| We need more places for folks to call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Whether that home is owned or rented should not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| We are a diverse city and 51% of us are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Yes, we should provide as many structures as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| for people to own and build wealth with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| as I one day hope to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| But we need to remember that those of us that rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| are equally valuable and valid residents in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| and our current ADU ordinance is hurting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| far more than helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| An ADU is not an Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Fears of ADUs somehow bringing in short-term renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| of a few days or weeks at a time are unfounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| and quite frankly offensive because it makes ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| seem like something detrimental to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I can't stress this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Something that is not a single family detached house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| and that is not owned needs to stop being treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| like a virus to expel and instead needs to be understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| for what it is, just another type of home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| for people in a different stage of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| or with different needs and preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Fears of neighborhood change are always to some degree valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| People care about where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and they want to make sure it's treated well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| We all agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| However, I would challenge every single one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| to make policy decisions based on fact and not fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| When there is data that disproves our fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| which there is for ADUs without an owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| we must act based on data and hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| and not on fears that hold people back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| The specter of large out-of-town investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| swooping in and buying properties is unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| A fair fear, sure, because we all want Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| to be cared for by Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| but it is a fear based on a boogeyman and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| You cannot listen to those who always say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| the world will fall in with any increase in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| or an addition of renters to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| That has never proven accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| and it is offensive to the majority of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| who rent or need to live in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| different than a detached single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| We belong in every neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| and we need places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| We must build policy based on data and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| We cannot ever let fear guide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| Please pass this resolution as it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and respect those of us that rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| and are hopeful, not just people afraid of the boogeyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Now we'll move to the people signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| in opposition to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| First is Ms. Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Ms. Phillips, if you could state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| and you'll have up to five minutes to address counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| My name is Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| I live at 1307 Michaels Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| First of all, I want to say I do not have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| with an owner having one AUD as a homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| provided that that homeowner actually lives on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| there is off-street parking provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| and that the AUD meets building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| and our Knoxville codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| AUDs are already a problem in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| when it comes to the owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Stricter proof of residency needs to be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| A tenancy driver's license and proof of a utility bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| is all that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| and they, of course, an owner could have that easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| The perfect example happened at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| of my narrow dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Back in 2018, a single-family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| with an over-the-garage apartment was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| The gentleman that lived above the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| had to move, and it was turned into an Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| but the owner still lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Then, from then on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I'm going to give you a brief history of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| In 2019, there was a tiny home put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| There was no permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Codes was made aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Then, he finished the full-size basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| in the single-family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| and so, therefore, he had three Airbnbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| and a glamping tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| which we do believe is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| In 2021, he moved away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| but he still had a driver's license at that address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| and he still, of course, had utilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| The main level was converted into a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| This left a total of five Airbnbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| plus the glamping tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| In August of 2022, he sold the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| The tiny house was removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| but we still have four Airbnbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| plus what we believe the glamping tent is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Since 2021, we've experienced excessive traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| on a very narrow road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| where two cars cannot pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| except in particular places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| because one side has this drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| and excessive speed of cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| makes it hard for at least four homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| to pull out of their driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| because there's a blind hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| and they come flying over the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| We have, a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| late-night parties, fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| open fire pits in the back next to trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| And the main thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| we have drug dealers that go down there and stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| And in early 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| TBI began watching this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| along with several other properties in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| There's more problems out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| than a lot of you are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| I was advised by TBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| that drug dealers now go to Airbnbs versus motels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| because it's harder for them to be caught at an Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Knoxville is your stopping point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| for your state pipeline that's headed toward Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| My understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| that these out-of-state people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| were passing through and stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| and they were drug dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| And on April the 13th of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| three of them were arrested by TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| And it's scary for residents to have to be told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| go inside, secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| do not come out until further notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| and then you've got Sheriff's Department helicopter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| circling that one particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| until other TBI officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| could come and help the other TBI guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| who had caught the watchman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| that was attempting to escape down the back stairwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| The current owner occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| does not need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| And it needs to be enforced with stronger rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| of proof that owners reside at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| The parking requirement does not need to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| because we have neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| where street parking is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| There's not enough room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| on especially narrow, more neighborhood streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| When a homeowner chooses to invest in a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| and chooses to live in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| and pay taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| they should have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| to quiet enjoyment of their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| And we need to maintain our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| and not be running motels out of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| And I would urge you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| to not support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| for current long-lived tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| or renter homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you, Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Next person signed up to speak in opposition to Item 12B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| is Mr. Leland Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| My name is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| I live at 6902 Haverhill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I'm here tonight in two roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| One is as a homeowner in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| and the other is as the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| of the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Regarding the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| that I'd like to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| is the owner occupancy requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| that's being considered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| We believe that since the ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| is now a matter of flaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| and they can exist and can be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| we strongly believe, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| that the owner occupancy requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| needs to stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Our reasoning is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| You have an owner occupancy of an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| then at least you have some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| You have a person who will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| for that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| and the tenants and behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| and the upkeep of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| and there is some measure of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| of that ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| If you remove an owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| you lose that oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| of somebody who actually lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I would be curious to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| how many members of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| have an ADU or would consider an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| And the reason I'm asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| is not necessarily to put anybody on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| but rather to have the perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| that we have as homeowners in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| The other concern that we have, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| is that if you remove an owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| suddenly somebody is going to buy that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| and they're going to have two rental properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| which, again, is a rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| is considered a transient situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| People don't stay in rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| for long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| being 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Occasionally they do, but it's rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| And we think that that's not a healthy environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| for building a strong community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| such as West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| And I'm only using West Hills as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| because I live there and experience it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| And we have several people, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| that do rent in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| and there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| But people aspire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I know that we did when we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| to buy our house 37 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| We knew what West Hills was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| We knew the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| We knew it was strong, good school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| good families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| communities that looked out for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| took care of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| And that's what we want to see stay in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| just like any other neighborhood in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| So we really feel strongly that the ADU situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| needs to be thoroughly understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| from the perspective of homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and people in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| We don't see it as a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| When we first learned about an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| and how it was supposed to function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| we were told that it was pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| like for family situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| You have an older parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| that may need a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| or you have a child that needs a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| and so you build an auxiliary dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| that could be there on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| and you could be close by to help them as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| The discussion I'm hearing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| and leading up to tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| has been about looking at it as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Homeowners like us have an investment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| We invest, and not just financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| but also, too, as far as building a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| building relationships long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| It's an extended family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| and we want to do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| to protect that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| We really strongly know and believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| that that leads to a healthy community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| and a healthy city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| And I think that it's your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| as members of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| who can make ordinances that can influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| the healthiness and the vibrancy of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| and communities like West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| that you act and think long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| We know that there's a housing situation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Demand is high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| but there could be short-term solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| that have long-term negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| And we think that if you drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| the owner occupancy requirement for ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| that could be devastating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| to not only our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| but communities across the city long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| We ask that you please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| The third speaker signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| in Opposition Item 12B is Jay Schmid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Mr. Schmid, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| My name is Jay Schmid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| 4218 Hiawatha Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| And I'm also here in a dual role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| as a homeowner for 30-plus years in our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| and also as president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| of the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| We agree ADUs are a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| They're going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| They're going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| to be coded into the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| And we're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| We really strongly think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| that the owner occupancy should remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| I know Councilman Roberto worked on this extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| when the recode went through five, six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| A lot of things Mr. Hume said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| I'm not going to reiterate what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| because we think along a lot of the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| But we feel that owners should be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| He spells out that having an owner there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| gives some eyes on the situation of an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| There's some ADU-type structures in Sequoia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| that go back 80 or 90 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| when they were built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| some of those older homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| They weren't called that back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| places for other family to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| or extended non-family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| This is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| We want to keep our neighborhoods vibrant, growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| Sequoia is a diverse area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| It's got single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| It's got some apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| It's got some townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| There's a fair number of rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| There's a lot of, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| existing ADUs that go back many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| I don't know the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| There's more than many people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| So we would just ask for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| to think of this carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| We want to keep the neighborhoods growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| and we don't want to see, as he's implied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| outside people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Is that a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Look at Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Nashville's had a lot of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| the last decade or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| and I've heard secondhand information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| for whatever that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| There's been a lot of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| that people there aren't always most happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Older homes getting bought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| and ADUs may be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| A lot of them just turn into rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| and too much traffic, too much everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| We just appreciate what everybody's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| on council and city staff to work this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| This is a complicated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| and we hope you can use your wisdom with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| I want to start off by thanking the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| and the neighborhoods who came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| to the town hall that we had in the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| We specifically discussed owner occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| and that requirement for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I was also really pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| that we had neighbors outside of the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| who were concerned about this and came as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| and expressed their pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| that this was being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| I also want to thank Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| and planning staff for recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| the inherent risks of this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| and not recommending any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| to the owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| For those of you who are just now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| tuning in to this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| ADUs is a strange-sounding name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| but this was a highly contentious issue in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| ADUs stands for Accessory Dwelling Units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| and basically what we're talking about there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| is a primary unit and a secondary unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| that would be on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| The primary unit would be the larger one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| the secondary unit being the smaller one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| During that debate and the contentious issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| that came up with accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| the owner occupancy was added in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| to make sure that there were opportunities for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4018)|
| 1:07:07| The debate at that time was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| not having any ADUs at all or having ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| and the compromise came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| with having it be owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| and that satisfied the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| because at the time, a lot of the discussion was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| if you have aging parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| and you wanted to have them stay at your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| but they wanted to have a little bit of independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| families wanted to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| If you had younger children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| who were adults but not quite ready to leave the house yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| you could have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| If you wanted to rent it out for some income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| All of that is currently in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| that exists right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| You can do all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| It's really no secret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| and we've talked about this at last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| we've talked about this exhaustively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| that there's a lot of interest in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| and this has created an imbalance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| in supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| There's already a great interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| from investors in buying homes in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| as there is across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Removing owner occupancy provides an enhanced incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| for investors to buy our limited supply of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| Now, if our challenge is about supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| then we don't help the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| by accelerating demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| especially in our more affordable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| And the proposal that Mr. Marlow discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| about limiting the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| while there is more infrastructure there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| and that was the basis of the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| there are no guardrails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| when you're inviting more investment into a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| ADUs are not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| They are expensive to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| They will not be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| They will be market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| That's not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| What you're talking about is taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| identifying, and targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| affordable housing that exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| and having folks come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| renovate everything, build something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| and make it much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| That's not helping the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| That's not helping renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| What we need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| is what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| and focusing investment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| where we can have mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| That's what we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| I believe that removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| the owner occupancy requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| will do exactly what I just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| incentivize more housing to be invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| and bought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Even when you heard the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| what words did they use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| They talked about investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| because this is about profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| It's not about families and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| This will hinder our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| to provide equitable home ownership opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| with diverse, attainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| and affordable housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| for all of Knoxville to call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| As such, I can't support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| This proposal changes the focus of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| from giving families options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| to giving investors profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| and I'm not going to vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Or was Councilmember Singh first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| We'll do you after Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Put your mic on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| First, I'm going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| with some of my feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| and then go into some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| There are a lot of good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| having this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| but whenever we start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| where we're going to put renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| where we're going to put them on the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| stick them into these red-line districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| that's what it feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| We don't want to deal with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| and their second-class rate of citizen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Like I said, this is my feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| but I'm a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| When I was looking at this red-line map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| and understanding what the legend was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| it felt real personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I guess the second grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| and Parker, you can tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| means that there's at least one Negro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| or one foreigner present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| So that feels real personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| because it feels like the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| is going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| There are neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| who want special privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| This housing situation is our cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| not just to be dumped on certain people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| who aren't going to come out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| and speak against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| or speak for their own housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| because they're too busy trying to make their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| When we were doing RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| one of the things we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| was established neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| not having to allow ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| I wonder, did we ever create that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| So has anybody applied for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| What's Ms. Brooks' question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Ms. Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| No, no one has applied for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| So that is something that can be done at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| if somebody wants the special privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| Another thing we were asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| do any of us have ADUs in our yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| This isn't about what I do in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| This is about what my neighbor does in their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| and I'm trying to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| what the other people in my neighborhood are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| So as far as personal property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| there's no respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| This being about investment completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| that's more about exploitative capitalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| and not about housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| And right now what the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| that we're having is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Yes, there are going to be investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| because this is what we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| but there's also going to be housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Yeah, I have a lot to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| and there's no way five minutes is going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| so I'm just going to tell you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| We can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Oh, I know, you're going to cut me off at five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| by my own desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| I don't even know where to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I'm going to start off by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| I'm not going to die on my sword on owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| It's not enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It's never been enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| We don't regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| We don't deed restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| You can build an ADU, have an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| but we don't control the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| and we don't control who buys it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| there are things that you said I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| and there are things that you said that I don't agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| and I don't have time to get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| in my short windows that I get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| But there are a lot of cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| that are incentivizing ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| and most of them are sticking with owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| Very few of them are removing the owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| But here's what I want to point out specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| You gave pretty impassioned points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| about owner-occupancy ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| and investors coming and buying those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| We do not owner-occupy restrict rental houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| single-family houses, duplexes, quadplexes, anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| I could go buy any house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| in any neighborhood across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Well, maybe I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| I don't want to make it sound like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| a pot of money and the financing ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| I could go buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| and I could, I know some pretty good architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| They might be listening to this meeting from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| They can take that compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| They could design in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| for me to have a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| out of any house in yours or my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| And I could do that as an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| and then I could resell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| or I could rent them both out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| because we don't owner-restrict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| But I'm not going to die on my sword| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| on the owner-occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| I'm going to say that our ADU requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| are too complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| They're all over my neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| I have a child who said to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| when they were six years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| my child was six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| I was on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| He was real sad-looking one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| and I said, what's wrong with you, Hagen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| He goes, Mom, I just don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| how I'll ever be able to get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| and afford a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Now, why did my child think that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| But he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| I said, well, honey, good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I said, the good news for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| is your mom's on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| and we're working on putting ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| into the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| and so maybe we'll build a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| for you to live someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| and you won't have to leave home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| but you won't necessarily be messing up my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| He loves to put crumbs all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| and I don't think that'll stop anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| So one of his NICU compatriots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| he said, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| But also I want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| sometimes people aren't relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| You can rent to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| I have this issue with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| talking about renters the way we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I know I'm rambling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| because I've got a lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| There's a former county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| that served his eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| and he was living in the pool house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| I believe it was called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| and some people are going to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| who I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| one of the former accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| That one happened to be in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I don't agree with the TDR request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| to limit to a certain area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| because there are ADUs all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| and they tend to be in more fluid places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I'll disagree with you on the affordability thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| They tend to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| when I look at other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| like San Antonio, Lexington, Denver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| they tend to be smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| so they tend to be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| There are one right down the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| There's one a block away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| They're all over my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| but they're also all over West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| So I don't think we can limit them to any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| And I wanted to answer Mr. Hume's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| I do not own a date ADU, but as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| I might build one one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| I have quite a large lot, and I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| I do own the house next door, and I have a renter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| That renter has been my renter for no less than five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| And I actually had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| about trying to do a rent-to-own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| They told me they don't want to be a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| I have another renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| That renter's maybe been my renter for about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| I have another renter that's been a renter for at least five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I've had lots of renters that stayed for long times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Part of this is because I don't charge enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| to cover my own expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| But I'll tell you what bothered me and kept me up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| real quick, because I'm just going to run out of time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| is the emails and the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| And I'm not talking about all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Some of these people are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| What they said about renters and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| they talked about renters in some of these emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| And the last thing I'll say is a lot of the complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I get in my district are not about renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| They're about owner-occupied homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| where there are drug sales and problems and hoardings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| and codes violations of owner-occupied homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| So bad is not cornered by renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| Bad happens other places, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| And so please do not talk about renters that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| It kept me up all night when the Housing Secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| sent me emails like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| And please don't anyone feel that I target that at anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| It just, I think we need to think about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| we couch our conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Council Member Parker, and then Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4722)|
| 1:18:51| I'm also trying to figure out where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| Because we're kind of all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| and merging different issues together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| my understanding that our short-term rental ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| applies to all properties, not just ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| So we're not targeting ADUs when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| comes to short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| They're completely separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| Completely separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| I'll just tell my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| And actually, Council Member Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| made largely the argument, the same thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| that I had around missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| And that this isn't the, this housing crisis that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| this housing market that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| is not the time to implement changes to our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| code that could attract more investors into our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| And there are multiple reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| One is, if you look at the research, not just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| but if you look at the research, research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| shows that the treatment of renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| is often better by smaller rental companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| or individuals who rent their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| versus the large corporate investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| And we've had individuals, week after week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| come in and talk about these large corporate entities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| have taken over housing, whether it's a KCDC property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And they're not actually good neighbors in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| They're actually not treating our renters well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| So as I think about how do we create the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| market that's going to be healthy for us as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| and for the people who live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| I have to keep in mind these large corporate interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| When we have folks who are committed to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| even what we saw from Mr. Huber, a local developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| when you build relationships and commit to a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| you do have different outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| And that doesn't mean whether you're an owner or a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| I have a renter who's been in my house for five years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| And she can sublet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| She's had other renters in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| That's her income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| It's not additional income coming towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I don't regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And quite honestly, to Councilmember Ryder's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| we are not providing the oversight when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| comes to our short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| We probably only have a few websites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| that are even being monitored, if they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| And there are ways around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I mean, that's something that she could possibly be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| And I wouldn't even know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| So I don't know how that we will enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4956)|
| 1:22:45| I don't know if there's a commitment from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| to better enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| It doesn't seem that there has been a commitment made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| I believe at our workshop, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| said as long as they're paying their short-term rental fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| the city's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| So my concern is that we need to focus on the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| piece and ensuring that we have an ordinance in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| that people can actually build expectations around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=4992)|
| 1:23:21| Right now, we can't really build any expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| around that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| And we've learned the way the state law is set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| is that any time we at least touch the short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| ordinance, it has some serious implications moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| for our enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| So for me, it is unfortunate that we've mixed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| the ADU conversation with the short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| I think we have to keep owner occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| for short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I would be open to a discussion or sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| us to a workshop to better understand the ADU owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| I think that we'll go to Council Member McKenzie, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| Vice Mayor Smith, and then Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| So Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| So for the district that I serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| it's a double-edged sword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| My strongest opposition has come from communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| that can afford to build ADUs on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| The other part of my district and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| who could benefit from extra rental income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| with an ADU on their property can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| to build them on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| And there are a lot of renters in houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| And so when we step back and we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| and we talk about what's affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| that's dependent on the person, on each individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| and what their income is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| We, as a body, because of our state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| we can't regulate rent and what's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| So if this actually could be a free-for-all for investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| to come in and start buying up properties that have space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| to be able to build ADUs so they're doubling profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| some people say, oh, that's going to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| But will it really be affordable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| It won't be affordable more than likely for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| who need affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| And those are the people who are struggling sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| to make it week to week, month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| And so while we have the housing shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| and we talk about missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| we cannot forget about those people who are barely getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| by because they have minimum wage jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| living at the poverty levels, but making too much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| to be able to get the rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| And so I am in agreement with Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| that we may need to slow this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| and talk about differences between short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| versus ADUs because I think that there could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| be some blurred lines there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| But I think that we need to be very cautious as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| forward because we absolutely could be opening up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| the floodgates to something that could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| some very bad unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| short-term and long-term, for people in our communities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| are getting priced out and are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| having to live with family members and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| because they cannot find somewhere to live that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| is affordable for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| So when we throw that term around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| affordable, I want us to be very clear what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| And I'm looking at everybody out here and my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5195)|
| 1:26:35| Affordability is different for each and every one of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| as it is to people who are in the audience today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| So I say that we need to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| And at this point, I'm really struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| to be able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| I do think that the owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| even though we have some opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| to be able to enforce that better than we have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| to this point, serves a purpose, absolutely serves a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5225)|
| 1:27:05| I agree with a lot of the sentiments of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| First of all, I've rented in five places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| around the city in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| in the Fort, in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| So I've been lucky enough to purchase a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| but I've rented all across this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| So I have a perspective that I think applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| And as somebody who's advocated to allow renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| to sublet Airbnbs, I don't think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| any shortage of critique of my advocacy for renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| I agree with planning's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| So I'm in support of the utility setback and floor area changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| but not the owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| What's been interesting and was real clear about in the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| last week, which is why I think it was really helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| was that not all strategies provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| the same type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| And that sounds obvious, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| one of the things being in a huge housing shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| is that we see some folks try to apply all solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| to different types of housing strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| and we see some folks who don't want any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| And so in the spectrum, each strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| is meant to solve a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| As Councilman Roberto outlined, the intent of ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| was for an owner of a property to provide space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| for someone else, whether it be a relative or renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| And so I think that strategy, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| should do its role in the housing ecosystem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| and not be stretched or contorted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| into trying to solve a bunch of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| It has a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| It has a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| With that said, I do support more ADUs for owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| So I have them in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I have friends that have lived in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| So I support those for owners of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| And I think we should remove, as Councilman Ryder mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| we should remove as many barriers in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| And I think this applicant has outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| a few of those that I would support, either at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| or in subsequent stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| And I like the idea of workshopping this a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| One of the things I want to point out, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| and I think Councilwoman Parker mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| this in previous meetings, and I may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| have disagreed with a lot of the commentary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| but one of the points that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| to highlight related to ADUs is they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| will be smaller and therefore more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| That doesn't make them, to Councilwoman McKenzie's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| affordable in the technical sense as a percentage of AMI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| or as we understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| So in my research of cities that have more ADUs per capita| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| in other cities, what I come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| is why do they have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| And for those that do still have owner occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| why do they have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| And I looked at different cities and what is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| And the place I landed on was Denver's Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| They have a pilot program where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| are providing incentives to homeowners to build ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| and requiring that they stay a certain percentage of AMI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| So you are ensuring that it is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| only affordable in the general sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| but technically affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| And they're providing those incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| at an individual homeowner basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| And this is important, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| A lot of times, folks may be new to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| are critical of incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| We provide larger developers for pilots or TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| And I'm always saying, incentives are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| They just should be good for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| And so I mentioned in our workshop, Mr. DeBose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| that our NOAA approach is going to scale down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| I think a bold approach with ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| that keeps them with the intent and the strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| that they're used for in the housing ecosystem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| is to stretch incentives down to the individual homeowner basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| The biggest barrier, as I was educated by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| for ADUs here is just the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And so the Denver model allows for stability of homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| provides wealth building for the existing owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| particularly those who need it most and cannot afford ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| as much, creates long-term affordable units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| and provides access to incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| that larger developers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| So in other words, I think the right approach for ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| is not necessarily contorting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| into different applications it wasn't meant for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| It's making it more possible for more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| And I think the Denver model, they tried in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| they tried 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| They provided incentives for owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| to build ADUs in the back of their yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| hold it at 80% of AMI for five years in exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| for the other hard part, which is a bank-financed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| forgivable loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Financing is weird, as I've been educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| because ADUs don't fit into any banking box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| So in other words, this program, there's a 26-page report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| that Denver's put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| It looks back at the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| It talks about what worked and didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| I highly encourage this administration, KCDC, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| Bentley, if he's in the house, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| there's a way to be bold with ADUs as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| and unleash the creativity and the boldness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| to individual homeowners to do more as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| one last second, frankly speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| leaving it up for grabs for who knows who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| It could be responsible local developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| It could be people who buy 30 properties from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| It could be individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Let's not change the strategy of ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Let's make it more possible for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5561)|
| 1:32:41| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| I just want to say, like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| this is not an easy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| And I agree with Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| that there are parts of this that would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| and with this whole plan that I could probably support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| The ADU issue, I think, and I've said this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| at our meetings, I think part of what concerns people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| when zoning and we start changing rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| is not the othering of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| There's way too much of othering people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| in every one of our city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| You know, if you don't think like me, you're a bad person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| And that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| And I just go on that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Council members don't feel that way about each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| I would hope that our citizens would not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| But back to my train of thought about the ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| is when we have a hard enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| enforcing the ordinances we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| people have very little faith in our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| to enforce changes that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| So the, you know, I hear the ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| well, it's not always under-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Nobody ever thought it would always stay under-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| As a matter of fact, the way some of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| is written, I believe that if it can't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| on anything other than an under-occupied house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| would you have to tear it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| I mean, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| So I'm just saying there are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| that maybe need to be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| I think my hesitancy with removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| the owner-occupied ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| or the owner-occupied piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| is this is how we slow the roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| And I agree with Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| that the incentives to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| who live in neighborhoods or who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| in any neighborhood, who can't afford an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| but would like to do an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| that would help housing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| because then family members could live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| and that's what ADUs were intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| It was aging in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| generational living together like we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| But if people can't afford to build that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| in their, on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| then that also causes problems with housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| So I think the, and financial institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| will figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But, because they have in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| so that would take some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| But I do think that is very much worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| At this time, I am not prepared to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| lifting the owner-occupied requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| because I think there was so much strife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| I wasn't on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| I can't say, I didn't sit through the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| like some of my colleagues did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| That there was so much strife about RECODE in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| We made a big change last week to TDR and middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| And I just think that we can study it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| and come up with a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| to increase the supply of ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| the way we would like them to be developed in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| than just taking it, the owner-occupied piece off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Council Member Ryder, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Oh, actually, I don't think Council Member Helsey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| has spoken on this item yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| So, no, well, it was, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| She hasn't spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| I just turned it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Oh, I was gonna add, and I agree with a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| of what everybody else has had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| I'm not ever opposed to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| but I think ADUs took such a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| it was painful, I guess, during RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| from everything I hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| It seems like, to me, if we're gonna make a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| even think about changing the owner-occupancy rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| it needs to go back through some public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| Because it's like, we did this in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| and now they're like going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| so we're gonna change it on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Sorry, while you weren't looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| So I just think it needs some more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Yeah, so Vice Mayor Smith brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| some really valid points about, did I forget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| About.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| Vice Mayor Smith brought up some really valid points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| about how other cities are incentivizing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| how they look at, some of them are doing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| like waiving permitting fees, and wastewater impact fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Some of these places have development fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| As I would read through them, I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| well, we don't have those fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| so we couldn't waive those fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| but maybe there are other things that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| that would subsidize in a different way than financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| So there are lots of places that we can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| at those types of opportunities to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| What I will say is, I started looking at different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Denver was one of them, and they've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| the West Denver group had a book online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| you could read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Lexington, Kentucky was the only one that I had found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| that removed the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| And what I will say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| by removing the owner-occupied requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| they have much more stringent restrictions on size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| and bedroom size, they have more limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| So they're saying, it doesn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| an owner-occupied property, but you can only do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| And so, on that note, and when I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| and compare us to these other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| I am not comfortable supporting removing the owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| even though our enforcement of it is how we issue permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| It is not tracking sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| It is not tracking and recording deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Because in lieu of that, what we did at Recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| was Councilman Roberto put forward a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| that is in the code right now for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| if they wanted to restrict and opt themselves out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| And as Ms. Brooks said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| there have been zero applications for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| I don't necessarily condone that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| but that is an option that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| for people that feel that they, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| shouldn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Looking at other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I think there's a lot of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| for us to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And I realize some of my colleagues have their lights on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| and want to talk about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| but here's what I would like to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| This, what we have to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| which has nothing to do with Airbnbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| it is strictly owner-occupancy slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| a couple of other changes about maximum heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Actually, that was recommended as a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| and didn't get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Adequate utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| maximum floor areas, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| The Planning Commission, what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| it came to this body, we reviewed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| we sent it back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| The Planning Commission made comments on all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| and the, I'm sorry, the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| And then the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| changed the owner-occupancy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| What I am prepared to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| and maybe that's why one of my other colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| has their light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| is to pass what has come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| reverting back to the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| of the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| which would be to remove the owner-occupancy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| And to do that, we would need to defer to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| We would have to make a motion and have a second on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| and then make an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| to go back to what the planning staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Okay, I'm gonna cut myself off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| and apparently Mr. Smith wants to comment on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| and I don't know who's next to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Mr. Frost, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| I'm wondering, Mr. Swanson, under section one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| what would you think if there was a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| to delete part D as in Delta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| which is the owner-occupancy part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| I'm not sure what you're asking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Certainly I think a motion could be made to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| and if adopted, it would delete that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| Would that accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Can I jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| The way you phrased that, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| I think is gonna confuse people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| about what I think your intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| If you look at page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| I think it's 561 of our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| That's section B, accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| and what they did was they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| there's blue lines striking the number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| and then the sentence, one of the dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| must be occupied by the owner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| I think what you mean is don't remove this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Right, I was looking at section one on page 557.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| On 567?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Then you could strike D and that would eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| any reference to owner-occupancy from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| Yeah, I just phrased it the way I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| because when I spoke with Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| it was basically going with the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| that's on our packet, page 563 and 564.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| So I don't have, I just wanna make my intent clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| I'll let, my five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I'm not sure who was ready to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| I was going along the same lines as Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| in I don't think that we have the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| for the entire thing to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| but I don't want to lose some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| that I think are good in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| So I'd like to work on how we can change the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| The second piece I wanna add is this didn't go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| the administration like so many things do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| and then you presented our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| It has not been, I have not had any staff look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| except in a very cursory way to prepare for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| but it hasn't gone through our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Does administration have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| I think that more community input is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| But I also think as you all saw at our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| we have a lot of work to do on housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| and only so much time and energy and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| And so I wanna put our money, time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| with the things that'll have the biggest impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| This is a smaller impact item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| but I know that we need lots of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| just for supply and for affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| I guess I would like to see this go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| the city take a look at it and see if it's worth the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| to implement this one, especially since it's such a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| One thing, so is someone making a motion to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| so the owner occupancy provisions are not changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| but the dimensions and other things are adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| I think you have to make a motion to have it seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| Okay, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I think you have to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Someone has to make a motion to approve it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| And no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Okay, motion's been made to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Okay, motion's been made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Is there a motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| I'm not sure of the exact words right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Mr. Johnson, can we pull up page 557 of the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Give me a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Well, my colleagues can scroll to page 557.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| As Mr. Frost was suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| in section one there's four articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| one of which references the owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| So Councilman Singh, I think what we could achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| the way we could achieve what you're suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| is to strike D of section one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| Which is what Mr. Frost said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| Yeah, I'm trying to say it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| And then get into the meat of the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| proposed zoning code, which is at 560 something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| And for that matter, if we all agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| on striking D, we could even either pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| on first reading or even postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| to give the administration a chance to double check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| and offer a perspective on A through C of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| if anybody followed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| All right, so I'm making the motion to strike D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| A motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Yeah, motion to amend this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| by striking article D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| And leaving in the owner-occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| Okay, does everyone understand the motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| Well, the people voting on it can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Okay, so does everyone understand the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Any questions or further discussion on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| You guys all have lights on, but unless I see you nodding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| I will say no, you don't want to discuss the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| I think just for clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| I know Mr. Johnson's pulling it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| For those watching at home or those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| what's being proposed as an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| would retain owner-occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| And so what's being discussed is in section one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| of the amendment that would make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| Number D is the part where the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| removes the owner-occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| That is being struck from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| by Council Member Singh's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| And what that would do is if you go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| to page 561,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| then what striking that does is it leaves section two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| and that would continue to say in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| one of the dwelling units must be occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| by the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| except in land use areas designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| traditional neighborhood residential, TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| Well, that's a change too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Yeah, so we don't want that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| So I think we first have to, let's do the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| You said strike it and let's come back to the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| Okay, so I mean, the amendment can just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| the sense of it and then the lawyers can figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| the language later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| No, it has to be very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6508)|
| 1:48:36| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6516)|
| 1:48:36| Section D is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| So like section D is a reflection of the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| So if we strike D to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| we're keeping the owner-occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| It's that straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| And it's referencing that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| D is referencing that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Well, my question was gonna be for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| What is the current language right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| Because I think what people are gonna wanna understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| is that by striking D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| the language that exists currently is remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| And that's the only part I just wanna confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Just give me a moment, I'll pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6559)|
| 1:49:28| I unfortunately cannot pull up the council packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6568)|
| 1:49:39| Well, it can be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| So under section B-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| an ADU may be located only on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| with one single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| However, in the E&N districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| ADUs shall be permitted unless the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| prohibits them in a new approved E&N application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| One of the dwelling units must be occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Okay, so I think the complete amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| would be to strike section D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| in the ordinance proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| but then to leave the language exactly the way it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| under section B-2 regarding accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| Okay, and I think that's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| because then everyone understands what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Okay, so Council Member Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| as the maker of the motion to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| is that your understanding of your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| Please use your microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| If we cut D, does it not cut that whole section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| All I'm doing is confirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| that that language stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Because it's originally in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Yeah, so what we're doing is we're reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| what exists today, so it's very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| that what exists right now remains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| the language, when we cut out D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| so that if we go back later and we're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| everyone's very clear about what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Council Member Ryder, do you have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| or a comment on the amendment on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Should I clarify the amendment, or are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| I think the amendment is as clear as it might get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| under the current circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| Striking D and then leaving Article B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| Current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Striking D and leaving current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Okay, so any further questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| on the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| So I just want to clarify the sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| that has the blue line through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| Is that staying in, or is it staying out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| Only the words one of the dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| That's the only word that's currently in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| and that's the only words that would stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| if we make this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Okay, so the following, except in land use areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| et cetera, that would be gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| All of that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Okay, I just wanted to clarify it, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| So it should look just like it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| in UD code, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| I just wanted to make sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| Okay, so the motion has been made to amend and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6753)|
| 1:52:40| I'm frankly a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Does this affect like the geographic area of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| Okay, all right, all those in favor of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Okay, now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| And I just wanna, I wanna reiterate what I said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| in the place it was lost in my rambling trains of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| because one of my constituents messaged me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| and asked me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Prior to recode, duplexes were allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| in RN2 and above, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| So they weren't allowed in RN1, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Ms. Brooks, the majority of the city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| The majority of the land in the city is zoned RN1, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| I would say the majority of the land is zoned RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| My majority of the land, prior to recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| duplexes were allowed as a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| No owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| So my constituent said to me, so just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| and they referred to missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| and I said, no, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| I can make my house a duplex and rent both parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| but not splitting the house and building a rental unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| in the backyard is a bridge too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| And I just want everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| and that was what I believe Mr. Durham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| or someone who spoke's point was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| building something that's 800 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| because it's a little garage apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| or a pool house or whatever, is the bridge too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| But having a duplex is not a bridge too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| because that is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Now it is a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| I'm not opposed to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| I'm gonna go along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| but I just want you to all be understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| I think that we are being fooled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| by owner occupancy tagged onto something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| That's all I just want to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| But the majority of the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| require owner occupancy for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| I just think an ADU with 18 foot height restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| smaller than the house, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| is smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| And I just want people to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| And also, when you say you can build an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| because I don't want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| I'm hiding some cards behind my back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| and I'm not telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| When we say owner occupied required for ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| all of those are eligible for Airbnb rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| because that is our Airbnb ordinance, owner occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| which I stand behind and have no intent to make a change on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| But a duplex is a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| And I want you to all be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| Okay, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| One of the big topics that came up in the town hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| and has been talked about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| it was about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| And so I wanted to ask Director Aarons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| to come down and talk to us a little bit about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| And the reason I want that to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| I want us to have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| is because I think there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| there have been some examples that have been given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| that Mr. Aarons and his team who do a very difficult job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| and do it well, would not permit to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| And that's been discussed in these meetings over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| And I just wanted to confirm those things with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| Director Aarons, you guys are going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| a very significant software update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| And one of my questions, my first question to you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| at the end of that, when you've got everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| squared away and you're ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| that would allow you the ability to track ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| much better than you do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| In our previous conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| there have been discussions about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| no one is building ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| And you and I had a discussion in a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| and we figured out by looking at the permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| how many ADUs are being built currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| And to best of my recollection, it's about 50 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| So the notion that there's none of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| we've restricted this so bad that no one can even do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| That's not true, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| All right, so it's about 50 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Okay, now this is the part that was very concerning to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| came up in the town hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| it's been discussed in these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| But one, there's been some discussion about tricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| to deal with your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| And so specifically, there were three of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| that I remembered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| One of them was, I can change my address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| on my driver's license multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| and get different permits for different properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| just because I'm changing it, and I can skirt the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| The other one was, I'm gonna have a gas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| or a power outlet for an oven installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| in the ADU, but I'm not gonna hook up the appliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| so as to avoid you noticing that I'm gonna put this in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| it's gonna be an ADU then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| and I can wait until the inspectors leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| and then I can put in the appliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| and have an ADU that would have been going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| through a different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| The other one was, I can cover things up with drywall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| and I can make sure that you can't tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| when your inspectors come through what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| So my question to you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| if any of these things ever occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| how would you and your team respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| So with our system right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| our previous software system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| we didn't require everybody to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| So if somebody was a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| they were just a homeowner permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| we didn't track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| Right now, we just require everybody to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| Doesn't cost you anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| we just need to know who's building what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| My front staff, if they see the same person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| coming in different residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| they're gonna throw a flag on the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| and we'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Out in the field, we do rough-in inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| which is, for those of you who are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| in the construction industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| before they start hanging drywall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| before they start covering everything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| If we see a 240-volt circuit run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| to an area that's looking like a kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| if it looks like a duck, it smells like a duck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| it's swimming around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| we're gonna throw a flag on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| We'll say, hey, this doesn't align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| with the plans that you submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Go back to the plans review group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| and make sure that what you're doing is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| Whether that's a wire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| whether that's a gas line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| whatever it is, we're training our staff to be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Trust me, my staff is aware that ADUs are a big deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| and they're keeping their eyes open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| and they're recognizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| and if there is something that's questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| they're bringing it back to the office and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| hey, this is what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| I took pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| And so we do deal with that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| And the only reason I bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| Director Aarons, is because I don't want there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| to be a misunderstanding from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| about what your office is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| because like I said at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| you're doing very hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| and you're doing it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| And I don't want people to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| that there's not enforcement going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| And the second point that I think no one would disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| is that if that kind of thing did happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| I would expect you to take immediate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| like you talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| and make sure there were consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| for somebody who was trying to play at games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| and hide things from your inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| And I trust that with you shaking your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| you're telling me that you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Let the record reflect that he was nodding his head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| not shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Yes, enforcement matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| and Peter and his team do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| I mean, Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| There's a motion to approve, and it was amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| and so we're back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Well, as amended, the amendment passed too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| The vote's been taken, I think it passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| but we'll do it again for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| Okay, the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| I think I, did you count the votes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| Okay, why don't we just redo the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| Do you have more comments before the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Yeah, I just wanted to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| because there was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| leading up to the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| and I thought there was gonna be a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| to postpone this item as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| So I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| what motion was on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| The motion is as amended by Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| And it's on first reading, so it will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| if approved, it will be discussed again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| Any other questions or comments on the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| Everyone understand what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| Okay, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| I'll look forward to further discussion in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| 12C is an ordinance approving the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| of Benjamin C. Mullins for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| to the North City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7354)|

| 2:03:39| This property on Pratt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| it's not just property that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| We're part of the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| We own the Hampton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| We built it in 2008 on Pratt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7427)|

| 2:04:07| We've been able to pick up a couple of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| in this neighborhood serendipitously, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| When we built the True, we had to buy some lots with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| that ended up being landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| So when one of the lots came open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| we bought it so we could have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7463)|

| 2:04:32| So we bought those houses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| So we didn't go seeking all of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| They ended up basically coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7477)|

| 2:04:55| A couple of these houses that we rented or that we bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| we let the people stay in them at no rent for the duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| until we were ready to do something with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| So we are part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7506)|
