| 0:00:39| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=39)|

| 0:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Karen Pershing is here, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| she could come up for just a moment and explain about the packets that we usually bring and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| offer to our retailers who are asking to receive new permits tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| We wanted you all to know that she's here and available, and she just has a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| to cover very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Karen Pershing, Executive Director, Metropolitan Drug Commission, 4930 Lyons View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| We have been giving out DVD toolkits, which we do not have with us tonight, and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| we don't is there are two pieces of information contained in the toolkits that are date-sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| meaning that they will expire in three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| So we are in the process of updating those toolkits, and as soon as the new ones are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| available, we will be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Any of the permit holders would like to have those, we will be happy to distribute those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| If I can get their name and address here tonight, I will be happy to send those out as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| as they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| We do have our regular packets that Wanda Day has that she will be giving out, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| those packets are the tips for reducing liability that's really important for businesses to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| have, and some ID checkers as well in there, and several other posters and buttons and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| information to try to curtail the sale of alcoholic beverages to underage consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| And another thing I just wanted to mention quickly was 4 Loco and Juice, which are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks, have been removed from the shelves nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| These products are in the process of being reformulated and basically the caffeine being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| taken out of the products, but these products will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| If you look at the packaging and marketing of the products, it would be very hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| make a case for the fact that they're not trying to target underage drinkers, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| we just need to be aware that those products will be coming back onto the shelves, reformulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| For each can that's sold in convenience stores, one can is the equivalent of three beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| so the chances of binge drinking go up quite significantly with these, plus it's easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| mistake them for regular energy drinks the way they're packaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| So we would just appreciate your support of both the city and the county beer boards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| really take a look at these products when they do come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Ms. Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| I'm proud that the Metropolitan Drug Commission has really been ahead of the curve on monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| these caffeinated energy drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| It's kind of like a Red Bull with a huge hit of alcohol, and we've been ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| monitoring in our area and are very pleased that the manufacturer has chosen to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| these because they've proven to be very dangerous and deadly in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Yeah, I just wonder if she wouldn't mind repeating the name of those two that are being withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| Four Loco in Juice, which juice is spelled J-O-O-S-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Four Loco, as in going crazy, I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| They were referred to as blackout in a can, if that tells you anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you for being here this evening, and I look forward to having more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| as it becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=260)|

| 0:04:22| When I call your name, if you'll come up to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| First up is Bambi's, and I don't think they're going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| I'm going to ask to postpone that until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Mr. Chairman, does our record check say that they've withdrawn, or am I mistaken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| They contacted WANDA today and asked perhaps for a postponement, so I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=281)|
| 0:04:51| and make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=291)|

| 0:05:43| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Yeah, I wanted to just quickly compliment Mr. Lovely and Mr. Adelman for actually filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| out the question about any convictions or misdemeanors in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| It's an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| The truth is, if you've got any misdemeanors and you put them down, you're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| If you answer no and we find it misdemeanors, it's actually a, gives us a right to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=366)|

| 0:06:54| Yeah, I'm just going to, the Greers, Philip L. and Philip Gere, didn't actually answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| the question that the last applicants did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| And I doubt we're going to do anything, but if they were concerned about this, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| give us a reason to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=424)|

| 0:08:04| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I need a building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| That's the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| I'm going to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| But I wanted to point out on here, it has, for the school zone, Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| But this is really closer to Green School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| And that's, I've noticed that's on quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I don't know why, but oftentimes Green School is not listed as the closest school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| It's not listed here as the closest school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| But it is the closest elementary school to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=525)|

| 0:08:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=534)|

| 0:08:56| You'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Gaddy's Pizza, as you see in your packet, has asked for a postponement until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=546)|

| 0:09:25| Ms. Dyer, do you have any information to share on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Well, we sent a registered letter, and it came back unclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| The applicant claimed Ms. Day has tried notifying them at all the numbers listed on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| and they are disconnected or so we have been unable to contact this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| And this began when, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| In August for the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Is this the second district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| I've been by there a couple of times and there's signs in the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| but I haven't heard anything either in terms of any kind of where they're moving ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| So the chair will entertain a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| To?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| Or no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| If there's no motion, then it just dies and it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| They start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| What do we think is going on over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Are they working on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Does it look like they're going to try to open it or do anything with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| It's just vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| There just seems to be no activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| I haven't been able to see anybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| This has been before us how many times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| Less than September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I'd be willing to postpone it one more beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| and maybe some of us could investigate a little ourselves and see what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| given the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| If that was a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| If not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Are you postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Is that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Well, it's postponed until January 25th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| That's a proper motion, seeing no other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| All those in favor of the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Opposed, like signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Could you clarify, Mr. Chairman, what's going to happen in the interim, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Well, I think somebody's going to perhaps do some investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I don't know what, you know, we looked at the one in your district and you were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Of course, we're going to deal with them again at the end of this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| But, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I'll go by there and see what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| And I've not gone by to look at it to see what they're doing or not doing, but I just always like to give them the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| It doesn't do us any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| We just have to hear it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| So I'm going to try to see what I can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| It seems like in this economy some people give up, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| It could very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| I've been by several times to check on it because I was hoping that we could move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| It looks like they have items inside getting ready to set up to open, and there's an occasional sign that changes on the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| But I've never been by there at a time when there were customers or it looked like there was anyone working inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| Yeah, and it doesn't really tax this board, but it does tax the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| And I thought, you know, obviously I voted against it, and that's fine that it's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| But I think there comes a time when, you know, we've got to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So we'll move on with another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| So we voted on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=771)|

| 0:15:38| According to the records tracked from the police department, one of the applicants has not been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| I guess it actually says missing prints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| So it has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| So we would probably not deal with it tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| So I'm going to move to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Which is January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=955)|

| 0:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| It is a proper motion to postpone until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=972)|

| 0:16:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| I just wanted to ask the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I thought this was just recently made into one tree grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| We're just changing ownership and starting up again, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1021)|

| 0:17:14| Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Apparently their lease has not worked out for them and they wish to withdraw, but we'll still need to take an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1044)|
| 0:17:34| Move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| As I read this, have they said someplace they want withdrawal or a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| Well, I asked that question to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| She had conversation with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| She's given up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| That was obvious to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| If it's okay, I think we might want to postpone this just for one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| I was contacted by someone out there right before Christmas, and there was some concern about the requirements since the floor above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| and below it were both concrete poured floors, whether this full system was required for the whole building or just for the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| But it made a difference in terms of the cost of renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And if I'm permitted, I would go back and investigate that further and report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| I withdraw my motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| We need a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Was that a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| So that leads up to a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I'll second that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| To the January 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| No further discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1128)|

| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| I'll make a motion to approve subject to the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1160)|

| 0:20:26| I might suggest that when we pass a lot of these proposals or requests for the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1226)|
| 0:20:36| maybe we could hold on to these packet information and give it back to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Day and stop xeroxing and re-xeroxing the same information a hundred times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| It wastes money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| It wastes trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And it isn't very hard to sort the packet as you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| So just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| I think it's an excellent suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| We're going paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| We might still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| I guess the only thought I have on that is like they hadn't been in and done the task that it would still show up as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1258)|
| 0:21:09| I assume they could reshuffle or throw them away, but we give them the option of not wasting ten copies of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| I mean, does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| We've got some more business before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| We've got some businesses here that have been dragging the feet a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| First is Eastside Market on 2705 Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And they were approved at the September 21st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And it looks like that we sent them registered mail on the 6th and they signed it and returned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| But what has not, they haven't been in to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| So what's the Board's pleasure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Sixth District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| They have not responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| They responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| They received the, they signed for the registered letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Well, I'm going to make a motion that we postpone it to the next Board meeting and give them an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1335)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Well, we can extend it rather than postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| For 30 days or to the next 25th, January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| So that is a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Next up is Mandarin Palace, 3001 Knoxville Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| I do believe that would be the Second District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I'm assuming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Same scenario other than they have not, we have not received back the registered mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:05| We did attempt making phone calls as well and got no answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1385)|
| 0:23:15| Mr. Chairman, what, in the past, what have you folks done about, how many chances do you give people and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| I mean, just like you said earlier, it's not a burden for us, but as far as the staff and what they have to go through each time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| how many times, is it three strikes you're out or what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| I mean, it's really just at the pleasure of the Board as to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| There's no set rules or regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| No, unfortunately there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| And, you know, just kind of, I always look to the district person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| That doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the one to respond to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| but I would certainly want to give you that first, you know, ability to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Oh, that's my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| That's Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| So I'm going to put it on you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Well, when we contact folks and give them a chance to come back and they don't communicate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| I start to feel like, you know, it's one thing, usually they're extenuating circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| but I assume that, Dottie, we have tried to reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| One that goes above and beyond what would be normally necessary to contact someone who has initiated a beer permit themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1462)|
| 0:24:32| We are seeking after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| What's the last contact we've had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| At the beer board meeting when they were approved subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| we haven't had any contact with them since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I remember them being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I think there was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| I have driven by that location expecting it to be open, and it has not opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| It's just locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Maybe I could talk to the mall manager, but it strikes me as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| It looks like a project that started and whether it ran into financial difficulty or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| I'll take it upon myself to check and report back if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Either that or we kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| But I will take that upon myself to contact the mall manager and find out what's happened to this tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:21| Last, Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I am leaving, so, you know, obviously postponements really are none of my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| But I always tend to look at this as sort of somebody's done all the paperwork except that last little thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and I sort of hate that idea of not giving an extension, not giving a postponement when it's paperwork driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| This is somebody that's run into some problems with a contractor, and they haven't finished their building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| and they're just not open in the mail right now, and we could end up really affecting their business by taking hasty action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| So I'm always going to favor extensions on this kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| But like I said, I'm leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| So that's just my wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| And like I said, I don't have specific facts today, but I will get them and report back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Well, I agree with Mr. Becker and I think Councilwoman Bailey and others that we need to give people chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| because there are extenuating circumstances at many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| On the other hand, when you make application for the license, you know what the expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| And I have a concern that if you're not as diligent about meeting all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| will you be as diligent about checking IDs and filing the taxes and the other things that go along with operating the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| In some cases, people may just be overwhelmed when they actually get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and see that there was a lot more to it than just pouring beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| And that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I'm conflicted every time one of these come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| How many chances do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I guess in the old age when you have children, you keep giving them chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| and enough rope until they hang themselves and then we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And I don't want to be anti-business because I have a real concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| But at the same time, I have a concern that people are not being responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| You know, not going in for your photos, not going in for the classes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| Don't send a signal to me that you're a really responsible person to be doing these particular kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Congressman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I'm frequently in that mall because I'm a mall walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| And there was some activity there and it appeared it just stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| But I hope that they can open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I had heard something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:44| I had informal information that they were having to jackhammer open the floors, the piping or something was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| But I don't have specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| But I will check and I will get back to this body soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Has there been a motion made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I will move to postpone it until the next meeting, in which case I'll have information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| We'll extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| There's a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Nama?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| 506 South Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| I think Nama does have a representative here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Tasha Matthews, 506 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| And I'm requesting an extension of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| And that would be due to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| So 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| And Rick's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| Nobody here from Rick's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I'll tell you what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I'll make a motion to move this to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| We've got a couple of administrative women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Yeah, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I'll move it to the heel regardless to give them the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| And then we're back to, you know, Santa Fe, 3920 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| And I know, Counsel, isn't this the one that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Yeah, and that gentleman did come back to talk to us and told us about the problems with the estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| And I'm actually reported on some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| But, again, at that point, he was clearly on notice of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| I don't know why he has not followed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| I'm of the same opinion of Ms. Palmer in the sense that at some point you've got to paddle your own canoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1793)|
| 0:30:02| It may be the estate has gotten them bogged down and the roof work did not get done or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| you would expect someone to come back to us or to write to the staff and tell them, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| So I think we can just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| I'm assuming that that's the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Is it the fourth or the sixth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Well, it's actually the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I think it's in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| It is the sixth, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| My bad on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Isn't that the former location of Fats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I would really like to see something in that building, but this has gone on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Quite some time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| So I'm not hearing a motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I'm going to make a motion to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| If something's happened and somebody's contacted somebody, I'm just inclined to say this is about paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| Well, I hear Ms. Palmer and are they going to get other paperwork wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| I think lots of people can get at a point where they think, been to the beer board, it's all taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| and they're thinking about other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| So I'm always inclined to give them that break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| So that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I would like to amend that for instead of 60 days to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| And then look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| So we would need a second, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| I mean, I think I can actually accept that as a friendly change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I'll make that change on my motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| And then so the motion is to extend this for 30 days, well, until January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| Seeing no lights, no discussion, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| It may be that the staff should contact the probate office or someone and find out who the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| We've contacted the real estate agent that's trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| We've called every number we have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| We've sent a revenue officer to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| There's no activity that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And find no one that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| No, I was going to say there's a probate office in this building that probably has the name of the son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| I don't know whether you have contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| He is the current either owner or the manager of the estate that the family has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| and we could find out whether this lease is still existing or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Maybe it's folded or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| But that would be easy enough since it is in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| You have the name of the original owner, that lady that died of cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| It would be her estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Just find out who the son is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| He'll be the contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| That would be the most direct way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And that would be worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| If it's just a walk down the stairs or a phone call to the probate office, we'll get some read on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Councilman Bynum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Well, I was just going to say that if, in most cases, if the district councilman doesn't want to investigate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| you know, as an at-large member, I'd be happy to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| I think some of us know who the owner is, and I'd certainly be willing on this one to look into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| So we've extended it until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| And, Councilman Beatty, thank you for offering that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| We hope we have good news on January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| We have two administrative hearings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| First up is the Circle T market, who was before us, I believe, 30 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| or at the last meeting anyway, scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Ms. Toole had given us a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| and it was suggested that perhaps she might want to give that some further thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| And she has given us some more information here on her remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| And if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Theresa Toole, 204 South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| And you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Well, did you all get a copy of my plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I'm going to have to say that the main thing that's helped me with this was the kid I picked up that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| I brought all my tests with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| After we watched the DVD and I gave them their training manual, they did their tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| We still had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Some of my employees that we went over and reviewed again until I made sure that they all understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| It has been a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Councilman DelBocchi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Yes, I might ask, do you have provision, Ms. Toole, if you get a new employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| or start having some turnover where you get these new people up to speed, get their training in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Is that part of your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Yes, I only have four employees at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I think there was 10 to 12 packets in there, plus a DVD that each employee can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| take home with them or look at at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| So you'll continue that education process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| So there's plenty enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| We had to make copies, but for my small store, we have plenty left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| And you're committed to get, if you get a new employee, to get them up to speed, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I'd like to thank you for jumping in, taking the kit, taking this very seriously, and getting your employees trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I was very surprised at some of the questions that they didn't get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| So it was a very, very good training tool for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Ms. Toole is a representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Again, with all of my colleagues, we're so pleased that these materials were helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you for taking them home and looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Was there anything, as you went through the questions with the employees, that we could do in preparing our materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| to help other businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We're very, the Drug Commission is very committed to supporting businesses that have had compliance issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and we want to provide them, you know, the very best materials to aid in training their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| I think this worked great because they each have a training manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| They also have the exam to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| They watch the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Like she said, there's a couple of things that's fixed to be outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I've asked some of my beer distributors to provide us with the calendars, the day-by-day calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| So it helps them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| I think the other thing we've learned on this board is that training never ceases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| You know, it's an ongoing thing when you're hiring new employees, but also with previously existing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| And any time the Drug Commission can assist you by providing updated materials or new materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| or additional tests, please, please let us know because we're committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| I don't want to make it harder on anybody else, but I don't think sending me or management once a year to a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| expecting them to come back and remember everything they were told and, you know, tell my other employees they're going to miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| So it worked out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Is there any further discussion or questions of Ms. Toole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| If not, we thank you for your diligence and for coming back with a more thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| and complete plan, which I think will help you, obviously, in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Next is the Roaming Gnome Pub and Eatery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2264)|
| 0:37:56| Roaming Gnome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Michael Clement, 716 20th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| 1283 Beachview Drive, Sevierville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Mr. Clement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| I'd like to address the Board and say that we do appreciate the work that this Board does in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| The Roaming Gnome has eateries in both Sevierville and Merrillville, and they strive to meet all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2301)|
| 0:38:32| and go above and beyond as much as possible when it comes to serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Mr. Webb is the president and managing member of the LLC, and is actually on site quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| If you look at the plan that we submitted, there's, of the seven bullet points, three of those, one is 100% new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2326)|
| 0:38:57| with the remedial training in alcohol in-house twice a year with a qualified ass trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| That is something that they're going to take at their expense to upgrade their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| and to make sure that these things don't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| The other one was where staff had been reminded monthly of these laws, they are now reminded weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2356)|
| 0:39:25| At every weekly meeting, it is brought up and they are reminded that these are very serious, very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| and very business-ending events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| If we can't qualify our people and follow these rules, we won't be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| The next one that we have really stepped up is while the staff relies on door personnel to properly screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| they have gone back and told all of their servers to recheck if you have even a hint that someone might not be of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| even though they've passed the door and they've obviously been screened, to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| and re-screen them randomly throughout the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| We're trying to have redundancies so that if one fail-safe doesn't catch the issue, that another one will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2413)|
| 0:40:24| I have one, if I may, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| We recognize the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I don't have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I'm curious, when you go, it said to plus 21 after 8 o'clock, I think, on the campus site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| Walk me through that process as to what happens from the point that the patron gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| From the time the doorman arrives, they will start checking IDs at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| The managers will scan the building for any minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Obviously, we have occasional families and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| They're not asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| It's just from that point on to persuade the minors to get in there early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| It's basically coming in to watch the door, to card everybody, and to note anybody inside the building that's currently underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| But I'm still curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| So when they go up and actually purchase a beverage, then so are they checked again while they're being served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| So you're checking them at the door initially and then, you know, the server, if they're at a table or if they go to get served themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| then they're rechecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| So it's not a situation where they're getting a bracelet or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| The only time that we've ever had to use that was on a game day, just because of the mass amounts of people that are there throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| So, therefore, we do ban and everybody has to have a ban in order to purchase an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| And so it's one of the, I would assume, it's like a paper deal to where if you took it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| or manipulated it, then, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman DeVolopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| My question is similar to yours because when I read this, I got the impression that, well, during the daytime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| it's more eatery than pub and so we do some checking at the table before we serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| But I was picturing the wily college kid coming in at 7 o'clock and hanging around eating a pizza until 8 o'clock when he could start drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| And the way this read to me, one of the bullet points said that the staff relies on the door personnel to screen all persons entering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| and then they randomly check patrons as they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| But it didn't sound like there was a cure for the problem where someone comes in early, hangs around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| and then tries to switch to becoming a drinking patron, hoping everyone will assume that they're of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| because everyone after a certain hour is carted right at the door and doesn't even get in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| Would you answer that problem scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Each staff member is trained by the state and by us to card every person that is asked for alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| The only thing that we try to do to them at late night when it gets busy is to benefit the staff with the additional IDing of 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| So an extra layer at the door, that's all that's happening at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| You've got a fail-safe system, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| You try to keep them out, but you also card them at the service point of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| If I may, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| The individual will be carded when they request to purchase an alcohol beverage, even if they've made it through the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| and they're at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| They're going to be carded when they ask to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| That was the point of inquiry, is there a way to slide under and kind of hang out, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| I remember the day when people used to come in the trunks of cars to get in the drive-in theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| People think their way around obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| We're not going to say it can't be done, but we're trying to add redundant fail-safes in the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| and then the servers serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Anytime anyone asks to purchase an alcohol beverage, they will be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Councilwoman Reilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Chairman Pavlis and Councilmember Della Volpe have really asked my question, and it has to do with this bullet point number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| I think all of us may be concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And I've heard you, I think what I've heard you say for the record is that you're amending this plan in that what we read here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| is that after the 8 o'clock, I believe it's 8 o'clock cutoff, the bartender is relying on the door person to have carded everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2666)|
| 0:44:36| And the way your plan reads is the assumption is everybody is legal after 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| And as Mr. Della Volpe pointed out, anybody that has come in earlier when there isn't someone at the door could remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| And all your plan says is that management will randomly recheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Your plan does not say that every patron is double carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And, you know, what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that we would be much more comfortable with a policy that says that after 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2694)|

| 0:45:09| alcoholic drink, unless there's some kind of wristbanding thing going on at the door, in which case it would be very clear if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2709)|

| 0:45:23| What I would respectfully request, then, is remove the word random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| And we will make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| And they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110110interimmayorelection?start=2730)|
