| 0:12:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=753)|

| 0:12:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| First item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=758)|

| 0:12:44| Applicant...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| We got a new one on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Give us a second to get organized at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=772)|
| 0:13:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Next on the agenda, item 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=789)|

| 0:13:28| infill housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Proposed plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| traditional neighborhood residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| existing land use, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| This is going to be two reports and three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| So, we've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| the sector plan amendment to TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| traditional neighborhood residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| because it is consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=831)|
| 0:14:02| The second report...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Should we deal with that one separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Go ahead and deal with that or are you going to read them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| furthering on item 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| we have the applicant Parker Bartholomew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| same information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| but the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| the staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| to traditional neighborhood residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| because of the public improvements in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| and new information on housing trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| The third recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| is approve RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| general residential neighborhood zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| and infill housing overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| because it is consistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| and the adjacent land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| zoned commercial neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Parker Bartholomew, 816 Claybrook Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| The orientation of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| on commercial neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| would force us to put the houses facing Whittle Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| and also there are some setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| that are different in commercial housing and R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| and there's some material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| that I think make it difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| to build homes affordably in the CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| so we're just asking for a down zone to R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| so that we can orientate the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| towards money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| and our setbacks will actually be a little bit less than R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| or actually any of the R zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| than it is in commercial neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| So, the reason I wanted to request this off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| is I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| rezoning this from commercial neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| would be inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| and I'll explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| So, I do plan to oppose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and I hope that my solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| or what I recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| will get the same outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| that is desired by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| So, if you look at this area right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I know it very well just from driving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| It's a small neighborhood commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| There are a few businesses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| and a school right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| It's predominantly minority-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| and it's historic buildings and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| There's a few factors here that caught my eye with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| One, commercial helps support other commercials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| so I think that removing the zoning of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| regardless of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| would be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| because of potential future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| These are existing commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I think that leaving the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| for more commercial here would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| And then, in terms of what the applicant is wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| even though whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| single-family houses would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| the current zoning, CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| does allow for single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| It allows for all residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| that RM4 allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| and I think with even fewer restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| than what the RM4 and the TDR would put on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| Furthermore, there is an existing infill overlay on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| So, to the applicant's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| part of the reasoning behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| is for the orientation of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| of the front facades of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and the setbacks and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Infill housing has the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| and infill housing will be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| for any permits pulled on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| but infill housing has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| to approve variances in setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| orientation, and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and allow for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| So, even if there are setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| or requirements in the underlying district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| that might be prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| to what the applicant is wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| that would have to go through infill housing regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| and would be approved or denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| based off of their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| So, for those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| I think that for a long-term use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| of this part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| where this is a commercial little nook right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| I do think that rezoning this from commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| would be detrimental for potential future use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| and I think that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| can get everything that they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| So, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Yeah, I kind of have a question for Jessie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and maybe she could elaborate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| We had talked earlier about the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| that maybe Rn3 might be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| just given the limitations of Rn4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| and the amount of buildable space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| that is actually going to be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| You can elaborate on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| and I would also like to ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| if he had considered Rn3 for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| With the TDR land use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| it does recommend zoning up to Rn4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| so Rn3 would be another appropriate consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| for residential infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| if the sector plan were to be amended to TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Yeah, we considered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| in addition to just keeping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| commercial neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| With the setbacks in the building material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| our goal is to be able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| a brand new home here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| under $300,000 in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| which doesn't currently exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| unless it's a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| So, believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| coming here and spending $1,700 to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| hurts our ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| So, I think when we look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| and the materials that we're going to be able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, I'm really here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| standing here for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| and it comes down to setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| in building material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| and wall space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| with windows or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| and orientation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| So, yeah, we looked at Rn3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| we looked at Rn4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| and we looked at keeping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| commercial neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Jesse, are the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| different with Rn3 versus Rn4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| on that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And I guess my concern is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| if you're able to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| what you want under a lower zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| I would much more advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| for something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| than going higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| given just the predisposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| for other development in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| When speaking with the infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| about building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| they weren't able to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| if they could allow it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| because they would have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| under the existing zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| And maybe I missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| but in the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| the only thing I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| the building material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| which we're attempting to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| to put vinyl siding on this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| and the only thing that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| there's a specific part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| I can't tell you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| but it says in Rn4 that is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| I mean, I'd have to do a search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| of the muni code real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| but that was the one item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| that when I go to infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| I'd be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| it specifically says in Rn4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| that you can use vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Did you have a question for staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Yeah, Jesse, do you mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| with regards to vinyl siding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| I would defer to Lindsay Crockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| who really runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| the infill housing overlay guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| I don't know of the distinctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| of vinyl siding with Rn4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| in the infill guidelines specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| There's no distinction made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| in the code that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| And with regards to setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| the differences between Rn3 and Rn4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| with the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| are identical for front setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| very minor for other setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| identical for the corner side setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| and identical for rear setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| There might be some side setback distinctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| but they're negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I mean, in commercial neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| it specifically says vinyl is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I would be okay with Rn3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| if you all could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| that I could use traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| vinyl app siding on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| So that's the only difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| I see in Rn4 and Rn3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| as far as what we're attempting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| There's other, you know, pocket neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| and other things like that are permitted in Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| But the only reason for Rn4 here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| is because of the mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| that certain sidings are allowed in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| I can try to see if I can address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| but the CN zone definitely has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| restrictions on vinyl siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| but that's the only...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Commercial zones have some restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| but none of the residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| that I'm aware of have specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| for siding outside of overlay districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| like historic districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| that would have some restrictions on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Also the infill housing, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Infill housing can approve vinyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| They do have some purview over materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| but, I mean, it is an approvable material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| So infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| even if the building material restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| of CN restricts vinyl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| infill housing could approve vinyl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| That, I think, is a little bit more fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| You probably need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| some interpretation assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| from the city law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| The infill housing overlay district has...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| The design review board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| who is the board for the infill housing overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| has authority to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| dimensional variations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| and also lot size variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| But it seems to be more explicitly worded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| for setbacks and lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| than other types of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| My...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| If I could just say a final thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| and I would also like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I think that my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| you know, I want to look at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| I wanted to at least look at the semantics of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| and see if there was a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| to get everything that they want as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| And there may be a route there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| there may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| But I wouldn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| I'm still opposed to a long-term decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| such as the zoning and the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| to come down to a building material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| being the vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| And when I look at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| and I see that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| these commercial buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| there are bus stops, bus routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| and the school across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| there's a lot of foot traffic in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| and I don't think that it would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| to carve down on what could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| with this neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| even further from a long-term standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Because even if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| they may decide to build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| but they also may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| We see a lot of instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| started and not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| And I think that if it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| to just the siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I don't think that that's a good enough reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| to totally rezone something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| in a neighborhood like this that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I mean, this feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| bad gentrification to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| to have this little commercial nook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| that has supported the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| and then to rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| to a more limiting residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| So with that, I make a recommendation to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| or a motion, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| to deny all of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| I can read off the individual ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I need to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Or do I need to do one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| So I make a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| the East City Sector Plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| from neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| to traditional neighborhood residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We've got a motion and a second to deny...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Chair, if I may, I think it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| I'm sorry. If I may, one more point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| that I own the commercial space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| to the south of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| So if there's anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| that's going to be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| by removing commercial in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| it would be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| And I think if you all have driven out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| and looked at the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| that was done to that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| the last thing I want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| is to hurt this pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| And directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| in commercial neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| is a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| So at that, I'll let you all vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I'm going to play the devil's advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I do agree that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| a commercial neighborhood commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I don't know what is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| on this piece of property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| or what it's being used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| I'd like to know what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Bacon, is it? Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Yes, it's bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| What's on the property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| There's some asphalt that's on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| There used to be a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| that set right up...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| a county that faced Whittle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| and it was demolished at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| When you pull it up on KGS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| it actually shows a demo permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Yeah, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So there's nothing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| There's nothing there now, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| If we were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| I mean, there's a ton of residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And if it was zoned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| and they were asking to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| every one of us would vote no, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Seen it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| But I think it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| for it to be residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| And so I would be inclined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| to go with staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I think staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I think I would probably echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| what Commissioner Roth was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I mean, you've got a commercial node there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| but commercial, especially neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| it dovetails with the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| I mean, you have to have the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| to support the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| You have to have the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| to support the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| So in this case, I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| it is a down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And it doesn't preclude, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| as Commissioner Roth said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| someday if they came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| and asked to request to be put back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| into neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| then I don't think that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| I wouldn't have any problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I think we need the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I think we need to try to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| I also support staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| And it seems it's going to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| residential one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| So I feel like we should just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| accommodate the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| and the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And I'm going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| from a historical perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| So having grown up in the Alice Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Little Springs Spring Hill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| I can remember when there used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| to be a grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| very active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| a pharmacy right next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| the fire hall right next to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| There was a gas station on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| You go all the way down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| there's an old car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| that's now been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| for probably close to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| It's just sitting there crumbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| You come on down and you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| an old Weigel's that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| has been about 30 things since it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| It's a development area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| that hasn't actually come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| And when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| what we're struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| around not just Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| but around the state of needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| affordable housing and housing for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| I don't think it's wise right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| You don't want to just take something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and just downgrade it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| But there's a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| of other commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| in that area that could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| that hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And let the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| sort out everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| So I think staff's got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Love you, Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| but I won't be supporting your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| I would like to just reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I agree with Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| that we would not be jumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| to go back to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| which is why I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| saving it or keeping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| that is a better move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| But I would also reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| that single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| any type of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| everything that the applicant wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| any form of residential apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| single family house, duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| is all allowed under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| And the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| what this reasoning comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| is just a siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And that siding is still allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| in the CN district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| just no more than 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| You can mix materials up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| and who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| you could be mixing up materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And that's just 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| of the street facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| the front facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| They could put the vinyl siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| on the back of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| and spend a little bit extra money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| on the facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| And infill housing also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| may not even allow the vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| They may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| but they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And so I think to do a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| of something this big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| is unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| over the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| of maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| it's just a big jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| for a small potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| of maybe being able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| a slightly cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| siding material on the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| So I'm not against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| their plan at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| doing a single family house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Well, I wouldn't do a single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| but if they want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| But I'm just saying they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| That's the best route forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| So I agree with everyone's points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| that we do need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| But I don't think that my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| conflicts with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you. Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Residential could be handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| in neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And once you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| neighborhood commercial going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| it's always difficult to get it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| as we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| So if it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I suggest we keep it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| and certainly don't rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| just because of an issue of vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| To me, that's very short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| We've got to look more long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| than, you know, in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Anyway, I, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I'm curious as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| when the last new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| construction investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| of commercial has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Do you have any idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Mr. Bartholomew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| It would be mine at 2701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| It would be mine at 2701 Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Is that new construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| It wasn't new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| We took an existing building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| It was just about new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| But, yeah, new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| as commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Yeah, I'm going to just weigh in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| real quick with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| what Commissioner Higgins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| You know, when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| real long-range planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| trying to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| infill areas that need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| you know, every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| or every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| we're in here talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| more traffic and roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| and intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| and all these sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| we're begging people in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| to be located next to commercial nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and make it walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| You know, as Knoxville grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| obviously it's not Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| or Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| or any of these big cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| but as it grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| these infill areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| are going to be more and more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| You're going to have more turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| and more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| coming into these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| and these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| and people fixing them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| and younger folks moving in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| and turning over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| and to have a node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| that was popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| back in the 50s or 60s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| or whenever it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| to be able to have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| to reinstitute itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and he spent money on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| You know, who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| somebody might go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| and do something up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| as younger folks start moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| so I think there's some good foresight there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| and I wouldn't have thought about it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| I didn't as I read this report earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| but I'm glad you brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| because I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| All right, so the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| is to deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| to TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| with the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| so it's the motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| and we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| So we're voting on a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| to deny the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2206)|

| 0:44:43| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| I believe this is an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| that's persisted for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| I commented extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| during the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| with people requesting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| I stop commenting on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| parcel because I went up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| and down University and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| a pin and said this should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| be neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I brought in Bob Booker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| book and on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| concerning Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2705)|

| 0:45:08| neighborhood commercial from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2708)|

| 0:45:15| The neighborhood has died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| because it has no commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| We've got the zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| It should come all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| down University but for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| this piece is key to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| I want density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I want to build six or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| seven townhomes and the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| way I can find out how to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| that is through a CN and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| understand I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| to go to VZA and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| variances for the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| zone, perhaps work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| council to try to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| I think when you're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| neighborhood commercial for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| that, there's no residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| zoning that would allow me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| the seven townhomes on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| lot and we need housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| the only way to build more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| housing without making land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| which we can't do is increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| density and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| appropriate on University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Avenue abutting other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| It's on a bus line, a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| It's less than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| walking to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| It's less than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| walking to the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I think that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| So you're planning to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| seven townhomes on a 7100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| square foot lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| With significant topographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| It will be challenging, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| think, but I think it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| be done 20 feet wide each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| townhome resulting in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| building that's 140 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Plus parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I think the staff, you know, mentioned that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| the topography issues, setbacks were going to be an issue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I mean, we just denied or we changed the zoning previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| on a lot twice as big as this one almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| I mean, I think we need, you know, you can't compare the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| You know, one is 14,000 square feet and this one is 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| So it's, that's a sizable difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| So we shouldn't really be, we're not comparing apples and apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Yeah, I know better and I know I'm not supposed to be asking questions about use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| when we're doing zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| And I had made a comment to Jessie leaving on Tuesday that I thought that her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| thought about the lot being elevated and the topographical constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| and how small the lot was, that it wasn't worth the adjoining lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| It's going to be tough to put commercial on there, neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| But now knowing what the applicant is going to do for the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| I think that's super smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| And I think that's going to force more redevelopment in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| and I think that's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| So I'm going to be all about this one now that I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| I feel like it's sort of a roller coaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| because we had the great discussion on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| But then there are comments of this isn't, this area is dying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| because it doesn't have a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| This isn't going to be used for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| This is going to be used for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| But then the comment is, you know, density is the issue, not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| So I'm just riding along the roller coaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| But then there's a comment about there doesn't need to be a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| And am I wrong that there's a residence right behind this that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| literally like breathing on the neck of these townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| That's a historic residence or an older home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| That is a KCDC HOPE VI built and owned house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| and it would be on top of a retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| that would be abutting our approximately 16-foot-wide driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| private driveway that would be used to come off of Calloway one way to the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| where the seven townhomes would have rear-loading garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| I'm also struggling with trying to keep my head about me not getting lured into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| you know, this is the intended use because it sounds great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| but rezoning it means we're rezoning it for whomever and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| I think you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I would like to add just to further my argument that it's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| If you look across the street to Parcel 10, which I own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| it's zoned neighborhood commercial and it's got the same underlying one-year sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| whatever these other plans are that the rest of the real world doesn't really understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| Well, we have four different maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| But talking to staff, I was like, well, across the street it's CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| but I learned that apparently the CN at Parcel 10 is on the wrong sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Yeah, I was just going to refocus back on the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| and, you know, as a resident of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I'd be fine if it came in and wasn't residential too and was actually commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| I think that would still be very beneficial to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| So I think the zone is appropriate for whatever type of use CN will allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| And when it comes to the number of units, I don't think we need to get too focused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| That is all going to be a matter of plans and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| and potentially going to BZA for setback approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| As a resident, are you really speaking of you just see this lot as not contributing anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| Yeah, that's one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I hope to help with the concerns of the proximity to the adjacent house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| because I would say that, A, the buffer is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| and if BZA is willing to waive it, then I think that that's a totally different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| And regardless of whether the buffer gets waived or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| I would say that having structures close to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| would be very consistent to the rest of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| And so with a neighborhood like Mechanicsville, it's a historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| and historically houses and businesses and multifamily were very close to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| and a lot of people are drawn to those areas for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| So I think that it would be appropriate, regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| and then to not refer to the use at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I think the neighborhood commercial makes sense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| So just to be consistent, I'm going to go back to my previous comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| of letting the market sort this out, and I think it's happening here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| which is here's a vacant piece of land that is set there for 70 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| We now have someone that's wanting to come in, develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| that will bring additional revenue to the city coffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| that will help with other services that the city provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| versus what we just did, which was a vacant piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| that was really not doing anything for the community that it's now going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| So in both instances, the community is going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I think that's what's underlying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| So I just want to be consistent in both of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| that I am consistent with supporting growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| and letting the market sort things out in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| All right. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| That's all right. Commissioner Raul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| So my question is, and for everybody's knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| and I can't remember off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| is in R and 2, can this property be developed with more than one dwelling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| Can it be multifamily dwelling in R and 2 where it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| It could be a duplex in R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| It could be a duplex in R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| My understanding is it's too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Yeah, the minimum lot area is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I'm sorry. What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| The minimum lot area for R and 2 for a duplex is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and this is approximately 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| However, the land use designation of TDR does recommend zoning up to R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| So alternatively, R and 4, R and 3 could provide denser infill as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| So in R and 4, they could do a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| And potentially even three townhomes, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| My understanding is R and 4 would allow a duplex, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| My understanding is R and 4 would only allow a duplex, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| And while we're talking about history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| there previously was two single-family homes on that single lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| one facing University, one facing Callaway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| that were demolished by the city circa 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Well, staff just told us we have to go with what staff says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| She said they could probably do three. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Yeah. It would possibly require minor variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| but the CN zone would also require minor variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| All right. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you, Chairperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| I'm just going to let you know that I'm planning on voting against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| change to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| The planning process got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| The division there on University by creating residential on that side is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| And as far as Commissioner Smith's comment about the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| there's several R and properties in that area that are, from what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| understand, are empty and not being utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| So if density is really what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| the market could say buy those properties and put seven townhomes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| So, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| To that point, the market's very challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| because many of the remaining lots, of which I have a handful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| are tax sale lots, and trying to obtain title insurance is impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| And you've got to get a chance to recourt and do quite title actions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| each individual lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Since these are heirs of heirs, you've got to go to extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| publication requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| So to get clear title to where you could get financing to build is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| really challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| This particular lot is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So the only way to overcome the thousands of dollars to get clear title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| is to allow me to get density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Otherwise, I'll let it sit there as a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| It's $23 a month a year in taxes, because there's really nothing else to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| do except thousands and thousands of dollars in legal bills to clear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| And to take on that risk, I want density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| And I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Like I said, I personally live in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| and that's a bus line and a bike line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Mr. Marlow, I've been very lax in my procedures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| We typically, once we toss it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| the discussion remains at commission, unless we address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| But thank you for your clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| And let's move along to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Just one, hopefully, final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| I want to point out again, to his point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| it is a bus line going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| University Avenue is pretty, I don't want to say major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| but it's a big connector through that part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And I think that RN2 is probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| I would bet if we did a study over this neighborhood where we took all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| of the properties that are zoned RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| we would find that a vast majority of them are non-conforming to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| And as a result of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| I wouldn't want to compare this to other RN districts, because, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| most things in this neighborhood are not conforming to their underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| So I do reiterate and continue to agree that this would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| for a major road like this, or minor road, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| and that it would be in conformance with the patterns of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3443)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| So we have, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| we have a motion and a second to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3466)|

| 1:01:54| Oh, seeing one light, Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Just want to make sure, before we get to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| you said that you wanted to follow staff recommendation, you wanted RN4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| and I think staff recommendation is three instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| So just want to make sure that you caught that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I did not catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I thought we were at RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Sorry to interrupt the motion here on this, but I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Yeah, I'm glad you did because I saw an RN4 in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| and I did not see that they downed it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| So we do need to have a discussion about that, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| We wanted to be RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| That's what we applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Let's vote on the first motion here with the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3751)|

| 1:02:39| We've got one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Commissioner Roth, we don't have a light now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3762)|

| 1:02:49| to medium-density residential and hillside protection per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| We have a motion to approve the one-year plan by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Seeing no lights, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3784)|

| 1:03:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3786)|

| 1:03:11| Carol, obtain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Oh, let's see, we may have discussion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| We've got some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Could we hone in on that area a little further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Nick, is that your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Okay, so the applicant desires RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| Okay, be clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Staff recommendation is RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| I'd ask a question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I mean, you've got RN4 on two boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| It kind of makes that a square instead of an oddball L shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| What is your reasoning on that, Jessie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Yeah, this property was part of a governmental down zoning back in the late 90s, 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| That particular case was very well supported by the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| who cited the fact that this road is part of a dogwood trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| there are historic properties in the area, concern about setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| And we have received one public comment of opposition or concern about density here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| So out of respect for a very well supported community down zoning in the late 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| obviously times have changed, demands have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| But with RN3, it would still allow a good amount of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| but there would be more opportunity for community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| and planning commission review as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Mr. Chairman, before we go any farther, I just want to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| because I saw Dory trying to, I just want to make sure that Commissioner Selso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| who said that he voted no, I think he wanted it to be a yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| I just want to make sure that's clear in the record just before we go on on that last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| So I'm going to defer to our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| Ms. Blakeney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I'm not sure that Commissioner Selso actually specified that that was what he intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| I mean, I thought we were talking about the zoning, not the second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| What was your desired vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| My desire is to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| Okay, so then in that case, then we can correct the minutes with your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| And that's on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| The motion still passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| It will not change any practical outcome for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| but to correct the record, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Thank you both for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Chairman Hill, if I could ask a question to Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| Under RM4, is that permitted in medium density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| I just wanted to say that I support the RM4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and with that I'll make a motion to approve the request for RM4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| We've got a motion to approve RM4 by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| I was just debating that term a lot off and on a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| whether I wanted to comment based on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I'm trying to get straight in my mind why staff reduced it to RM3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| You said the density was the same in RM3 and RM4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| So what's the reasoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| No, RM3 and RM4 are both recommended zones within the MDR land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| The densities would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| The density would be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| So RM4 permits multifamily 2,000 square feet per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| RM3 does not permit multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| It does permit townhomes, 12,000 square feet for three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| and then 3,000 square feet for each additional unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| This is a parcel that's over an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| If it were to be a townhome development on this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| it would go through a special use approval if it was RM3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| which would allow for more community review of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I just wanted to point out under Section 4.2 of the Zoning Ordinance, RM4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| and she just touched on this, but to reiterate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| RM4 does have a lot more restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| It allows for more density, but it requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| it puts more restrictions for how you can get to that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| And so, for example, depending on what they decide to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| they may have to come back for a special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| And so from a neighborhood standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| RM4 would actually give the neighborhood more opportunities for input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| I've been lax on my procedure, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| I'm forgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Can you someone say more about what that would actually look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| because what that additional community review would look like if it went to RM4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| It would be a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| I'll clarify real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Sorry, over here, Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| There's two different review paths in RM4 for townhouses and multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| One review path is administrative review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| and one path is special use review in both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| So it depends on how many units are being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| It could be staff review only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| or if they go over a certain amount, then it goes to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| With townhouses, it's a little more explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Townhouses, if there's eight or less townhouses, it's staff review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| Nine or more townhouses, special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| And for multifamilies, it depends on whether it's one building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| or multiple buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| If there's five or more units in a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| it comes to the Planning Commission as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| If there's multiple buildings, it's eight units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| let's say nine units or more, or five units in a single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| So there's different review paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| It's either administrative for smaller projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| or special use for larger projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Commissioner Schell, so Mike, are you talking about if it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| are you talking about Rn3 or are you talking about Rn4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| That's Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Rn3, if it's a townhouse development, has to go through special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| That's what I wanted to try and clarify for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Rn3, a townhome, has to come here for special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Rn4, it doesn't necessarily have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| and that's what you were talking about was Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| Next on the agenda is Item 29, the applicant, B&B Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Location, west side of Central Avenue Pike, east side of I-75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| south of Barbary Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Tract information, 11.61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Present plan, designation and zoning, office, LDR, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| stream protection, planned commercial, agricultural transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Proposed plan, designation and zoning, office, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| stream protection, office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| Existing land use, agricultural forestry, vacant land, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Staff recommendation, approve the sector plan to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| SP stream protection, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| because it provides a transitional land use designation between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| commercial area and the adjacent low density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| The second recommendation is to approve the OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| office medical and related services zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| because it provides a transitional zone to buffer the low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| residential uses from the commercial zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| I'm here for the applicant, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| My name is Carol Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I live at 301 Barbary Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| It's in Broadwood Estates, which is a circle of about 32 to 33 residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4316)|
| 1:12:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Any others to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Yes, I'm Barbara Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| I have two homes in the neighborhood, one at 213 Barbary and one at 415 Barbary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Would you like to speak or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| I'll defer to the opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Ms. Jennings, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| I'm very new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| If you'd state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| So, anyway, I would like for you all to be aware of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| We already have a water problem that is inexistent as I speak right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| If they build the structures that they're talking about building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| and we are willing to work with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Hopefully, maybe it can improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| But we get a lot of water already from we have a retention pond that is already overflowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| It floods the subdivision as you come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Also, all the water runs off of the back of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4395)|
| 1:13:25| and down into the subdivision and into the backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| And, of course, you know, water goes to the least resistance, which is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| And then if you go around the subdivision, all the water comes down through the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| goes through two ditches, which adjoins my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| So if water runs off from any structures that is being built there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| it's going to make a lot worse water problems than what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| We already have flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| So I don't know if you're aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Like I say, I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| I want to go on record as saying there is going to be a water problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| and is a water problem as I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Ms. Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| She spoke very clearly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| We also have two wetland areas in this part that is being asked to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| And that part of the subdivision where the area is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| is receiving a tremendous amount of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| I pump water every time we get a rain, practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And the entrance is flooding, and the storm drains is running over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4488)|
| 1:14:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| I do appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Mr. Harbin is here with Patzenheim's Norvell & Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| He's the engineer that is going to be working through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| We're well aware there are stormwater issues already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Knox County has done a good job in improving its stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| and we will work through those issues to make sure that we are not making it worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| certainly, and there may even be an opportunity to improve some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| That whole area there where the right-of-way is, where it comes off the exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| that is a very wet area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Our development will be focused really on the eastern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| That's flat, and that's really the only real developable part of the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| But we'll have to work through permitting the stormwater issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| and make sure that, at a minimum, we're not causing any additional harm that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| I mean, the pre-water flows cannot exceed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| the post-water flows cannot exceed what the pre-water flows are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| This staff has it right on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| I mean, there's commercial surrounding this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| This is a good transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Office is a traditional transition between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| the commercial zones and, you know, this existing neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| which has been in existence a very, very long time before the stormwater ordinances required what they require now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| So, in fact, we're actually moving part of this from transition to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| which I think is a more appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| It will allow a flexibility of uses, including residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| So we would ask that you follow staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| and we'll work with the neighbors and we'll work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| to make sure that these issues are addressed the best that we can address them through our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4613)|

| 1:16:57| Mr. Chair, I'd make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4622)|

| 1:17:10| Vice Chair Hooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4632)|

| 1:17:17| Chair, I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion to approve OB office medical-related services zone per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Hooten to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4648)|

| 1:17:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Moving on to agenda item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Applicant Wilson, Construction and Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| Location west side of Tazewell Pike, east side of Shannondale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| Approximate size of track, 10.47 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Present zoning is low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| Zoning requested, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Existing land use, agricultural forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| Density proposed up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| because it is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4706)|
| 1:18:37| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| William Wilson, 3248 Tazewell Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| And do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| Would you like to speak or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4738)|
| 1:19:17| If you'd please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| My name is Susan Wolf, 4709 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4759)|
| 1:19:39| 4709 is actually the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| It's a little over 12 acres that's next to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| I mean, I'm going to say the traffic is terrible there, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| I'm sure you hear that all the time from neighbors in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| There's been many wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I've lived there 32 years, many wrecks at the intersection of Tazewell Pike and Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| My main, I guess it's a personal reason, my piece of property, which is the one next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| you can see all the woods, is the low area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| My family's owned that property since the 40s or 50s, and my grandparents' house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| they built a big house across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| My property now floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| There's been so much development around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| It's full of sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| In fact, there's a sinkhole in the front of this property that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| It used to be used as a pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| It had water in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Yes, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| That is actually a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| There's three sinkholes across the front of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| It's wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| You can't see it from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| They're fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| There are some other sinkholes in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I think you can see one right behind the barn that's right on the line right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| Then you can see a dry water creek or a wet water creek that comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| and empties into a large sinkhole right behind my house, which is the smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| When we have a lot of rain, that area around that creek bed floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| There is a lake that in some parts is probably 20, 30 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| All the concrete and roading that's going to go into this property next to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| is all going to run down on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Sometimes I worry when it's flooded if it will cause the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| I'm not an expert on geology by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| They did have at one time someone come out many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| They were interested in building on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| The geologist from the University of Tennessee, and I have a copy of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| said he would never build anything on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| We did build that house, which is on one of the high places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| I guess I don't know how much more water my property can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| because we've gone from never used to flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| to quite significant flooding when we have a lot of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| Would the applicant like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| Well, we certainly understand her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Again, that's an engineering thing that we will address, the engineers will address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4977)|
| 1:23:06| I don't really, until we have a concept plan for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| I don't have many answers for that yet, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Let's go with commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Is that you, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| It's Ernest T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Y'all are way too young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| So I do live in that area, and I am going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| which means I am now in trouble with my in-laws who live right up behind this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| so I will deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| But one of the things that I really do want to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| both the county as well as the city, we do need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and TDOT did a lot of great work down around the Broadway-Tassel Pike interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| It still does back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I mean, this morning I took my son to Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| We live just a little bit farther east of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Traffic was backed up from Jacksboro Park and Tassel Pike all the way to Shenandoah Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| So, you know, I know that at one time we had looked at putting a red light in right there at Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| and Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Certain voices in the neighborhood killed that rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| But there are some things that I do think engineering needs to look at in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| I know recently in one of the heavy rains, Tassel Pike actually flooded across Tassel Pike right in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| They came out and fixed some of the drainage issues that seemed to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| So there does seem to be a lot more water collecting in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| I don't know if we need to look at if there's some obstruction somewhere downstream that might be causing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| You know, going back to some other things we've heard about the property over there on Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| that floods quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| All of that drains together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| So, you know, they do have some valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| However, I do like the fact that this is four dwelling units per acre versus I think the first one that they came with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| was like, I don't know, 10,000 dwelling units an acre in that same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| It was a lot of outcry from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| So I will be supporting this and I will be taking all of my punishments when I get home later on this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| I drove the area this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| I've driven it several times before when we had the case come through previously with the different request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| But I just wanted to re-familiarize myself with it and go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| And absolutely, it's a precarious sort of entrance to Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| You know, depending on the season, there's, you know, difficulty in being able to see because of the angle of your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| And certainly if you have a lower car, it's really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| But I just kept looking around at the area and read about the topographical challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5155)|
| 1:26:04| and then look at the zones around it and what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| And I understand absolutely that there is a housing issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| but I don't think that means that we need to take every single parcel and pop as many things on it as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| I really think to be responsible, we have to look at what's around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| And while there was only one person here speaking today, we received nearly 50 comments from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5183)|
| 1:26:32| That's not the only reason to back what I'm saying, but I certainly take it into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| And I am not going to be supporting this and would like to make a motion to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5199)|
| 1:26:49| We have a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Seeing no second, we'll continue our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I just wanted to say that generally I think I'm in favor of this and I see all the issues with Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5222)|
| 1:27:12| but I do think that keeping the density on Tazewell Pike is better than going further into the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| I did just want to make a comment to the opposition, which I also noticed that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| there's 50, almost 50 comments online and only one person here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| and I appreciate you bringing those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| The reason I wanted to, what I wanted to say is basically allow the county engineering to speak to your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5256)|
| 1:27:46| because if this gets approved, I don't want you to, I want to be able to offer some hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| that it won't actually make your property worse from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| because the county will require a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| So do you guys want to have any thoughts on the feedback of the potential flooding with the sinkholes and whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5280)|
| 1:28:12| Yeah, I'll be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| Our stormwater ordinance is pretty robust as it relates to sinkhole drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| We require that essentially the developer has to assume plugged conditions of that sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| and then put a 100-year storm into it and ensure that that doesn't raise the surrounding water surface elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| So it assumes really worst-case scenario with a 100-year storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| so certainly we won't make this lady's concerns any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Yeah, like Commissioner Adams, I drove out again today to re-familiarize myself with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| I'm pretty familiar with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Like Commissioner Smith over there, I mean, I've got friends that live off Beverly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I've got friends that live off of Shannondale in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| And there are some traffic concerns, but, I mean, you've got another exit up in the Murphy Road area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| where you can kind of get up, you know, down towards the mall area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| I think the road's in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| It's pretty wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| But we're all experiencing different traffic now that everybody's coming back off COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| A lot of people are staying home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| I think the traffic patterns are actually shifting somewhat versus first thing in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| even though it's still pretty busy down there on the Broadway side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| But I do think with it having to come through, if the applicant brings a good plan back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| and we can review that and County Engineering has an opportunity to make sure that there are no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| you know, bad water issues leaving the site, I think I would be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| So, Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Yeah, to have density at the corner of Tazewell Pike and Shannondale right next to the elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| that's where you want your density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| and hopefully the county will work with this developer to maybe do some sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| that sort of thing to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| So, I would make a motion that we approve the zoning to PR for the acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| So, we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve the planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| Moving on to agenda item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| The applicant is Odedge Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| Location, Gondola Drive, west of east of Governor John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| east of Sevierville Pike, approximate acreage 32.12 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| zoning's planned residential, existing land use, agricultural forestry vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| proposed use, attached and detached residential subdivision, number of lots 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| no variances required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| and the staff recommendation is to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Yes, Chris Gollier with Ardera Group, 2160 Lakeside Center Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| We just moved, I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you, Mr. Gollier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5503)|
| 1:31:56| Sir, are you here to oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5516)|
| 1:32:22| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Mr. Gollier, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| Yeah, we just respectfully ask to approve per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5564)|

| 1:34:36| Brandon Martin, 3241 Red Meadow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Thank you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| I'll defer if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| I'm sure there's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| And I got the earnest, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| First question is how loud is the activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| Not the sounds that people might be making, but the sounds that the weaponry would be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| So actually I was kind of ready for that one, so I went out and just kind of took some decibel readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| And so basically at the end of the day, and I want to get this right, so I have it on here, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| So basically standing right next to a decibel meter was the sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| Every shot was 80 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| So I was just sitting in the back room while we're talking and having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| The whole room's average is about 60 to 65 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| So basically what it amounts to is turning your TV midway up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| Every shot, that's the sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| It is about that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| And I think it's still right at even the city's limit, not even the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| I think the city limit is 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| So it's even right at or a little bit, it could be a little bit above just depending on which weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| Did you get any readings on, so that takes care of the sound when the projectile is leaving the weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| What about when projectile is hitting something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| Oh, it's a tiny 6-millimeter plastic pellet, plastic BB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| The max range on these things are like 150 to 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| Isn't the paintball larger than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| We're not actually doing paintball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| It's more for airsoft, but we just fell underneath that paintball and airsoft statute kind of deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| So it's just airsoft, not planning on doing paintball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| We're going to leave it open in case somebody kind of wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| But yeah, and the paintball is just a plastic skin with a bunch of paint in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| So when it hits, it makes no noise other than what it's kind of hitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| So there's your sound probably right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| The other question I have is about the human sound and the people who are, you know, playing these games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| and having a good time and hooping and hollering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| That's a really technical term, the hooping and hollering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| I love it, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| How will you—I guess how can you assess that and how for those households that are closest to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5836)|
| 1:37:25| how might they be impacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| I mean, during game days, I'm sure most of it is dads and kids going out just trying to have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| So, I mean, I'm sure there's yelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| People get into it, not negatively, but, I mean, they get into actually the gameplay, have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| So, you know, I'm not going to sit here and lie that there won't be no shouting or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| There definitely will probably be a bunch of people having a good time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| but it's not everyone screaming bloody murder, running at each other like an old, you know, style war scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| It's just—that's just not how the gameplay works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| One other question, and this is on page 20 of the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| Yeah, big page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| You know what I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| For those who were not there, I'm asking about there was a reference of a particular type of trigger that is not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5891)|
| 1:38:19| like a binary trigger is not allowed, and no bang-bang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| And then bang-bang, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Yeah, I probably should put something in there to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| So, yeah, so binary trigger is literally a trigger that—zero and one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| So when you pull the trigger, it fires a BB, and then when you let go, it fires a BB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| And we don't—I don't allow those because those are more expensive guns, or I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| Sorry, won't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| But basically, it would give somebody an advantage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| Like somebody can only—is only shooting one pellet every time they can pull the trigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| versus a guy that's downrange and can shoot twice as many twice as fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| So I don't allow full auto on any weapon except for the small, really weak ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| And even then on the little bit larger ones and the ones that they, you know, make it into that echelon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| they're only allowed semi-fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| So it just keeps it fair across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| So that's a binary trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| And then bang-bang is a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| So I've played airsoft for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| And so when, say, let's say you and I are playing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| And I'm not looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I'm looking around this corner, and you walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I can maybe see you and turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| And if we had what's called a bang-bang rule, you could say bang-bang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| So you don't want to shoot me that close, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Because it doesn't feel good from a foot away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| But what that can lead into is me turning around and saying bang-bang before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| and then we get into an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| So I would just—my rules are you walk around a corner, someone's standing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| you shoot them in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| You're there to play airsoft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| It stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| It sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| But that's also why you don't want to get hit, and that's why you play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| So it's really just the bang-bang rule is we don't want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| because it just turns into arguments when people get hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| People really get into it sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| They really have a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| The way this is set up, it is set up with parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| and then all of the action goes into the woods, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| That way we create that buffer in that space between anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| So when the noise is taking place, it's pointed opposite of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| And, yeah, so that middle line, I mean, there's not going to be anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| or as few as possible on that very top or the very bottom, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| It's going to be two different teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| and they're just going to be coming at each other in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| So there's where most of your sound, where most of your, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| and they're not going to be standing next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| They're going to be off, you know, just going at each other that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| So, right, it's not going to be on the extremities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| There's no firing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| You have to keep a muzzle mask on your gun at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| and no magazine in your gun while you're in the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| If I catch any three of those happening, you're either firing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| you having the muzzle break off or the cover off, or you have a magazine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| I keep your money and you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| So a very hard rule to make sure that safety is for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| because there are going to be children that play pending it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Mr. Rochelle, so is your parking lot and entrance going to lock at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| Are you going to have a gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| We do, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| So because one of the conditions is regarding lighting the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| so you intend to have lights on the parking lot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| Are you going to leave those on all night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| or are you going to turn those off after you lock the gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| I mean, we really aren't – we're kind of reserving it to do maybe some night games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6117)|
| 1:42:04| It would take probably more than a little bit of preparation to do night games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| I guess I mean when you close, when you're done with the night games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Are you going to turn the lights off to the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| No, I mean we're only going to be open 8 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| so other than night games and night games we would assess that to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| But I mean whatever you all would recommend, we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| I mean I'm not prepared to – I don't want to make any waves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Well, one of the conditions is that the lighting could remain on for safety purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| on the parking lot only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Or have motion activation if needed or off preferably, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| You'd prefer to save on electricity, I would suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| If you have a gate, it makes sense to turn off the lights when you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I think neighbors might appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| I was just wondering if there was a plan around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Yeah, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| Most of this is going to be just gameplay during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and then when we approach night games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| we'll make sure that we're checking the right boxes as far as that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I just have two things, and this is more for Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| First, can we figure out how to use bang-bang in all future meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| That has been a fun term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| And the second thing is, as we've been going through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| I think our next professional development should be either a paintball or an airsoft outing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| And it really should, since Chair Phillips stepped down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| and Chair Hill now is over here, he can't pick on fake news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| So it really should be the commission against fake news out on the airsoft course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| Hey, Compass had a pretty good suggestion for what to do with this in their e-mail this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| in the form of a GIF, so I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| If anyone saw that e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| There's no telling what he wrote about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Thank you, Commissioner Hill, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| I was initially a little concerned about the noise, similar, I guess, to Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| And a little bit of research, and he's very similar, close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| and most of the decibels in the mid-80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| and it has a dependency not only on the type of gun you're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| but the propellant and the length of the barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| But a normal gun is about 140 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| So I think at the distance where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| I don't think it's going to have minimal impact on surrounding property decibel-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| So I approve the request for statutory recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| All right, we've got a motion to approve by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Seeing no other lights than Commissioner Phillips, which I'm sure is inadvertently on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Thank you, folks, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| So let's take, it's 3.15, five to ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Let's be sure to be back by 3.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| We've got one more item on the agenda, and I think it's deserving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| especially the good conversations and deliberations we've had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| We've got a lot of information to go over in this last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| So let's take five to ten minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Okay, let's reconvene as we move on to our final agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6323)|
| 1:45:39| which is agenda item formerly known as 22, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| The recommendation is approval of an amendment in Knox County City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| Zoning Code Article 5.3, to refine the application of Bill 2 percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| and Bill 2 zones in the CG zoning districts of CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| I know we had a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| I still think there's a lot of information that needs to be shared and considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| We have Adam Kontop from the City Engineering Department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| We have Will Robinson, who is a civil engineer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| And we move this to the end because I really think it's worthy of a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| I believe there may be an interim solution, but in my opinion, it's an interim fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| There needs to be a longer-term view of this, and we'll get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| I'm not going to try not to dominate the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| but I do have some information to share that I believe are barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| to redevelopment in these particular zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| So does everybody understand what we're doing with CG2 and CG3 from the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6415)|
| 1:47:06| And I know we've got some newer commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| This is a fairly new zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| probably the equivalent zone, and staff, keep your ears close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| to make sure I don't say anything inaccurately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| but I think in the old zone, the most comparable zone was C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Would you say that's right, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| In all of our major corridors, you would typically see C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| and then it would often move out to the CH designations for a more intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| C2 in the old designation was your downtown urban development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6463)|
| 1:47:52| And so CG2 and CG3 is promoting something similar to your downtown development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6472)|
| 1:48:02| Mr. Reynolds, would you say that's the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| It definitely allows the type of structures and locations that a downtown area would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| So it requires buildings to be brought closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| You don't have parking between the building and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| It encourages mix of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| You can still do single use if you want to, but, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| it is very much like a downtown zone in that sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| but it is a little more tailored for corridors and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| But, yes, it definitely does allow that style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| I was just going to ask, so, Mike, at the time, though, of the previous zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| was there any mixed use outside of the downtown area that would warrant that type of road designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6528)|
| 1:48:57| or development along the corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| I'll answer that for you if you don't care, because it's fresh on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| We did introduce a residential into the commercial corridors previously to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| not way back when, but I would say within a year, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| Yeah, I believe it was added to the C3 and the C6 zone as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| Yes, it was just, yeah, like maybe two, three, four years max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6565)|
| 1:49:33| before the new zoning ordinance went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| Yeah, I'm a big advocate for walkability, pedestrian orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| particularly in the areas that are shown on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| But the zoning itself, I mean, the district is not going to just do it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| I mean, I see a lot of issues with placement of sidewalks relative to the traveled way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| width of sidewalks, number of access points onto these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| in terms of how that leads toward pedestrian orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6608)|
| 1:50:16| So I think we need to look more long-term and maybe more in-depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| about how we actually make this occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| rather than just looking at the zoning as being the cure-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| I would also want to interject that on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| I would say instead of west of Westwood, I would say west of Old Bearden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| West of which one, Pat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Old Bearden Drive, which is like the next street to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| And that would include the property where Bearden Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| and the Adaptive Education Center and where you have Food City coming out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| And then everything to the west of that would apply to the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| not covered by the built-up percentage zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| They're not applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| So that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| If you guys, commissioners, ladies, gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| would be patient with me for just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I would like to kind of set some, I guess, share what I consider some facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6678)|
| 1:51:28| or challenges and address them with an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| And then I think it will help our discussion if you all will allow me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| Mr. Robinson, if you would come before the podium here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| and state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Will Robinson, 1248 North Shorewood Lane, Carrival, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| Thank you so much and stay close because I'm sure many of us will have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| But I went through the process of recode very engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| and some of the other commissioners were very engaged as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| And even though I'm in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| there were some things that I didn't see during this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| And I just want to share some of the challenges that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| When you look at much of this CG2 and CG3 has been applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| and I would say that the previous executive director openly stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| that it has been over-applied on primarily these TDOT major arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6746)|
| 1:52:34| And it took me a bit to really understand one of the big barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| And when I tried to set side-by-side urban development versus CG2, CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6759)|
| 1:52:47| which is supposed to mirror or be very much like urban development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| there was a clear distinction that created a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6772)|
| 1:52:59| And that was in downtown, you don't have curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| So think about that for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| You don't have a curb cut on each parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| In the suburbs, you have curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And more specifically on TDOT major arterials, TDOT dictates where your curb cut goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6793)|
| 1:53:23| So if you're a landowner, you don't really have the authority to place your curb cut where you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6803)|
| 1:53:33| In the old days, you often had two, three curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| Maybe your whole property was a curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| With the new curb cut standards, TDOT standards, I think revised as recently as 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| they basically limit curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| And Mr. Robinson, I want you to make sure I'm accurate on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| Basically, if it's under 200 feet, you get one curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| Somewhere around there, you get one curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Over 200, let's say three-ish, you get two curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| So the point is most of our city's properties that are on major arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6847)|
| 1:54:16| are less than the two curb cut requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| So think of it in the terms that most of the parcels will get one curb cut to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6860)|
| 1:54:28| So we also passed fairly recently a landscape and parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| that required a 10-foot front landscape strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| And if it's a small lot, you could reduce it to six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| So when you think about you've got one curb cut, you've got six feet of landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| You've got, is it fair to say, a five-foot sidewalk in front of your building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| Yeah, and we've got foundation plantings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| So you've got plantings in front of the building, then the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| So there's a lot to get put in this Bill 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| And the majority of your lots are also interior lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| They're not corner lots, so they don't have a secondary exit out to another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| So you've got one way in, one way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| So when you push the building up zero to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| let's say the average width of a property is 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| I know quick service restaurants are often 100, 110 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| So you've got, on average, a 26-foot wide curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| You have to be 20 feet off, a minimum of 20 feet off your neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| That's 46 feet that you've tied up here on a 100-foot lot that gives you 54 more feet to basically work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6948)|
| 1:55:57| You've got front landscaping, five-foot sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| The point is it's very difficult to circulate around a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Would you say it's – how difficult is it to potentially have a drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| You know, if you've got, say, a 150-foot wide lot and you're only allowed one entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| and my Bill 2 is 20 feet, I can't get a car through the drive-through, past the building, and back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6979)|
| 1:56:27| So, you know, it basically almost eliminates drive-throughs on a narrow lot, which isn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6987)|
| 1:56:36| it might be a coffee shop, doesn't need a lot of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| So it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Any questions so far on kind of just the set of circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| And then I'm going to kind of turn it over to you guys to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| You've got Adam Compton from the city, and you've got Mr. Robinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| or you can ask questions however you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| How about Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| I agree with what Commissioner Phillips was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| that this particular ordinance in and of itself wouldn't be the only thing that would make things more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| There are a lot of different factors that need to be considered to help make things more walkable and pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7043)|
| 1:57:33| But I think that it plays an important role in laying some foundational work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| and essentially providing that foundation that is accepting of those sorts of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7058)|
| 1:57:46| And so if we don't have something like this in place, we're absolutely not going to get that more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| And I'm almost hesitant to even just keep saying more walkable or pedestrian or cyclist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| It's kind of the difference of a human scale versus car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| And everything that's been discussed so far in terms of why this is problematic is all about car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7082)|
| 1:58:12| And it's not looking through the lens of how do we get to a more human scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| which is what this, I think, when the groups were meeting and talking about it, they were trying to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| is to provide an environment that can be more successfully navigated on a human scale as opposed to a car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7103)|
| 1:58:31| And even one of the things that was just brought up as a problem is the drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| And I don't think that we should be trying to engineer all of this with the goal of making drive-throughs our lowest common denominator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7118)|
| 1:58:50| Because that's not the goal of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| The goal of this is to be more pedestrian and cyclist and human scale friendly, which is the antithesis of a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7132)|
| 1:59:00| So if it's harder for drive-throughs, I think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| Thank you for your comments. Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| I was recently in Nashville a week or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| And one thing with curb cuts and TDOT not granting them quite as generously as they used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7153)|
| 1:59:21| and I think when you look at what we have along a lot of places, Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| one thing that's going to have to happen is lot consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| And it's lot consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| How do you see that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| And it's the unfortunate reality that if you have a lot that may not be able to get access potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| it has a lower economic value and it has to consolidate with the neighboring property to have a higher and better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7182)|
| 1:59:53| And you've seen that play out when the economics of a development in places like Nashville that have a lot of booming development consolidate lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7193)|
| 2:00:02| And then they don't need to maintain as many curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| And so I think that this isn't really that, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| That's just kind of an economic thing that will happen eventually as lots consolidate and things get redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7212)|
| 2:00:23| I agree that we need to look at this from a human scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| Working in Bearden and walking around, it's not the most friendly place to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| And I think we've got some good opportunity to maintain some of these build-to zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| I've put together a sort of revised version of this that I'd like to pass around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| that puts different roads on where these things kind of cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| I'm happy to explain the reasoning on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| The first one I left the same north of Ridgewood Road on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| Commissioner, could you wait until those circulate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| The first one was the same, the north Broadway. Ridgewood Road does not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| When you look at the parcels that are north of Ridgewood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| they are on a four-lane with a median in between highway on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7275)|
| 2:01:23| There's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| And so I think that cutoff makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| Number two, three, four, and five I have revised or come up with a potential revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7290)|
| 2:01:40| On Chapman Highway, and the pictures are in order as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| where you can see where our old cutoff was on East Yonge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| there is a large number of CG3 properties just south of that line as proposed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7307)|
| 2:01:58| And I propose we move that down to that Overbrook-Fronda Lane intersection that you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| and that would maintain keeping those parcels as part of this build-to-zone policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| You've got, and I think there's a lot of good reasons to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| Number three, Asheville Highway, making it, setting that line anything east of the intersection of I-40 and Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7341)|
| 2:02:31| As I said at our workshop, a lot of that Burlington area that is CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7351)|
| 2:02:39| there are current plans to redo streetscapes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| I think the city has done some engineering work and maybe some initial plans on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7362)|
| 2:02:50| And I don't think it would be good to exempt that area from Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| And I think I-40 would be a better line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| When it comes to Kingston Pike, I threw in west of Weisgarber Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| which is basically, I think, right after the Krispy Kreme, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| With TDOT looking and going in to do that entire intersection renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| along with what we've talked about, how from Westwood to North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| is kind of where I think we threw out last time we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Weisgarber really just kind of makes sense because you've got a CG3 or 2 property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| both north of Kingston Pike there and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| And so it would maintain those being applicable to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| And I think this CG3 parcel on the Kingston Pike and North Shore Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| and that was only redeveloped a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| That's not likely to happen for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| And then for North Shore Drive, I put a cutoff before we get to Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| which is-so it starts at Widower Drive and then goes up to Wilda Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| I don't know how you pronounce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| But that cutoff basically hits right before Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| a few parcels before Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Yeah, you've got to go just above the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| And so it keeps that entire Kingston Pike and North Shore intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| beholden to what we wrote the code and what we made the goals of the code to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| And I think if we see some more economic pressure for growth in housing in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| it wouldn't surprise me to see some of these parcels along this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| redevelop in a way that we've seen in some other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| I know we've talked about concerns of-so what this also changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| you know, we now have two grocery stores that would be in this Build 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| And there are grocery stores that are built new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| And Nashville has a good Kroger example that I've looked up where you've got-you basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7502)|
| 2:05:08| have one side of the store is where the loading dock is, and then you kind of have an entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7508)|
| 2:05:16| It's done. It's not something that hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| It's not something that isn't done in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| So this is what I would propose that we tweak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7524)|
| 2:05:33| And I don't want to start making a motion or anything because I know there's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| I'm sorry. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| I have a couple of questions, and I'm not sure who to direct them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| If it should be Mr. Robertson or maybe even Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| It's about TDOT specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| If a developer has a piece of property and they would like to develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7558)|
| 2:06:04| but they're not able to do so with the existing Build 2 zones that are on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7564)|
| 2:06:12| and with the curb cuts like Director-that Mr. Hill was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| can they go to TDOT and get-allow them to make changes to the curb cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7578)|
| 2:06:28| So whenever we make an alteration to a property, we have to apply for a permit with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| So it's-the definition of that has expanded where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| if I've got two pieces of property with a shared access, if I change one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| they're calling that a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| So I have to go back and get in compliance with their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| So if you want to change an access point, you absolutely have the right to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| And if you-the building hadn't changed, you can go change your access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| You can apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| But everything's permitted through TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| They do require-if there's not a shared access, it has to be 20 feet off the side property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| They want to see-I think it's a minimum 24-foot wide driveway at the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| So they do allow for these changes, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| And has the city, like, worked with TDOT in the past to, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| come up with these standards or maybe modify their standards so that they're in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| I mean, you know, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| the recode was a vision for what the city wanted and what the people-the citizens of Knoxville wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| And I would like to think that, you know, they can't control what the citizens want, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7662)|
| 2:07:49| And I think it's noble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| TDOT's driving force is safety of the driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| And in some ways, I mean, I think these curb cuts are pretty dangerous along fast roads like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| I mean, it's safer to have fewer curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| It's a complex equation because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| ideally you've got fewer access points and you share access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| But, you know, if you've got 150 feet and your neighbor doesn't want to share an access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| that's one thing TDOT won't do, in my experience, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| force people to get along and say, you know, you've got to share an access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| That's not been my experience with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Well, here's your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Here's what we've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| They're going to look at, you know, what's going on in the road, where the turn lanes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| I guess I haven't really had the problem yet of where I've got 150 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| and there's not a safe way to get on the road, and that's the only road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| I think they have a responsibility to let somebody access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| I think legally you can access your own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| So they've got to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| A lot of times they'll make us do a write-in, write-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| That's become a lot more common in my experience, where there's a concrete island that forces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| you can't go across lanes of traffic to leave a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| I'd like to let Adam Cometop comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| He's with city engineering, and they would more likely be having dialogue with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7754)|
| 2:09:21| The city does not provide a lot of input to TDOT's regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| We are one of hundreds of municipalities, so we don't get to add a lot to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7765)|
| 2:09:32| We do work hand-in-hand when they have applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| We coordinate with them, make sure we're not stepping on each other's toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| Has there been any application presented since the new zoning ordinance passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| where someone couldn't get, like, a curb cut into their property because of this build-to-zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| or has it been an issue with development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| I cannot recall of one where that's been the case, but I cannot recall a lot of new buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| PG2, CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| I can think of, off the top of my head, only one that had a shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| It was very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| One that Will actually did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| But it was a very narrow lot that shared a driveway with a very large lot, so it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| So you had to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| If they didn't have a shared one, you would have had a very hard time redeveloping that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7819)|
| 2:10:29| Another question on the drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| I feel like we've talked a lot about the drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| Mike, you might want to clarify for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| Drive-throughs are not permitted uses in these two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| It's still special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| Yes, they're special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| The process, I mean, was that part of the process to not allow or allow them to be special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| just because that's something that's more vehicle-oriented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7853)|
| 2:11:01| And sometimes I think the CG2 and CG3 was developed more for pedestrian-style type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7861)|
| 2:11:11| Yeah, that would be my impression of why that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| Just to make sure that they're being done not only in the right locations but in a mindful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7874)|
| 2:11:23| So when we bring those to the Planning Commission, if there's something that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| you know, if it meets the standards but there's still concerns regarding the way it's designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| then we can still have an influence on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| It may not necessarily prohibit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| You know, the Planning Commission could still approve it if they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| but we could still require some modifications to the design if we felt it was important enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| And the Planning Commission could deny it too if they felt it wasn't appropriate for the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| And I guess my other thought, and I'd like for your comments on this, is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| instead of just looking at, you know, being involved in Recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| and I know a lot of you guys were involved in providing input for the rezoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| but, you know, this was a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| It was a plan that a good number of citizens were involved in, gave feedback to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| I remember these discussions about CG1, CG2, CG3, about whether these built-to-zones were appropriate in these zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7936)|
| 2:12:26| and it passed, and it just passed a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| You know, we had three years of feedback amongst the whole city and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| I mean, it was a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| I don't have to speak to a lot of you guys who are involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| But this was the plan that, you know, we had for the city, and this is what the citizens wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| And given the fact that it's just been two years, we haven't had a stop in development because of these built-to-zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7967)|
| 2:12:57| And then given the chance that there's still a process, if someone is willing to develop a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| and these built-to-zones are such a barrier to this development, they can go to BZA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7983)|
| 2:13:13| They can go and appeal it and say, I've got a hardship to developing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| I would like to get these curb cuts changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| I want a reduction in my landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| You're limited to a select number of hardships, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| I'm just telling you, there's a process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Let's talk about the hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| What are the hardships of BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| Do you mind if I finish talking first, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Do you mind if I finish talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| So, you know, so they can go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| They can also rezone their property to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| But do we want to go out at two years into this in-depth plan where we got so much feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8030)|
| 2:13:59| from residents and say, we're going to change this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| Instead of giving it a chance for the citizen's voice to be heard and develop it in the way they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| The developers, they have a lot of, with Recode, they got a lot of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| They have a lot more flexibility with their property to use it in a lot of manners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| which allow them to, you know, be beneficial and make money on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| That's the goal, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| But, you know, this is the vision, and I feel like we need to keep it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| and we need to honor it until we get to a point where this is really affecting development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| And in that case, maybe we need to look at it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| And Steve, can you tell us the hardships at BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| Well, I can help address that, since it's a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| But, I mean, it can't be economic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| It has to be something that, so the criteria are mainly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| is there some kind of natural feature that's an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| You know, sometimes it's like your lot shape could be an issue that you bring to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8113)|
| 2:15:21| And, yeah, I mean, it's mainly natural topography, floodways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8121)|
| 2:15:28| you know, something that is a natural problem with your property that's unique to your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| or shape or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| I would say that there was one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| I'm pretty sure it received variances from the Thorpe-Arizona Appeals in CG2 on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| but I could be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| I can't remember 100% if it went through BZA and got a variance to move the build-to zone back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8144)|
| 2:15:53| I think the project never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| It had a lot of other issues that it had to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| Could that be a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| You can make a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| Commissioner Midas, I share your vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| I am right where you are and want to be in that direction of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| My caution is that we have put so many barriers up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| especially with TDOT being the primary barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| that what we are going to encourage is for property owners to work within what they have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8186)|
| 2:16:34| so that they don't have to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| So instead of McDonald's, say, demolishing one of their prototypes and going to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8196)|
| 2:16:45| instead they'll just maybe make some minor modifications and keep what they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| because maybe they can't go to the drive-through or maybe the property won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| These are just concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| I'm not telling everybody that everything is a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| but I also want to comment and say the idea that we have given it two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| and we have made modifications to our zoning ordinance because we saw flaws in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8227)|
| 2:17:16| And as I'm not a know-it-all, but as a commercial developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| who sat in there at 1.30 in the morning when Mayor Rojero said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| we're not leaving until we get this passed and we'll go through every line if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| as a developer and being in this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| I didn't see some of the challenges at that time that I see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8252)|
| 2:17:38| And I just want to share the concerns from a developer's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| that these are going to be challenges and barriers that are going to be very difficult to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8263)|
| 2:17:52| And I totally respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| My question is, why now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Why after two years, if we're not seeing this development not happening because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8278)|
| 2:18:04| why do we need to change that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| Well, we've spot-zoned two parcels already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| Okay, so let's keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| We've spot-zoned one west of West Town Hall and one on Broadway to kind of deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8292)|
| 2:18:19| But now you're saying we're going to change the zones on hundreds of properties because of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8299)|
| 2:18:27| Well, we had an executive director that stated she admitted it had been over-applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| and she recognized it and recommended that at least we deal with it in this capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| not overhaul the whole thing, but let's constrict the boundaries to some degree and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8319)|
| 2:18:48| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Well, it sounds like TDOT's the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| But no, on a serious note, this isn't everything that I have my light on for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8335)|
| 2:19:01| but can someone help explain why CG1, I assume someone from staff, why CG1 doesn't have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8341)|
| 2:19:13| Just touch on that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| The build two zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Well, I guess the intent was to try to minimize the different, like, multiple different types of zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8358)|
| 2:19:27| CG1 zone, CG2, and CG3 are really close to being the same except for some dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| They allow the same uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| They're intended to go in generally the same type of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| I think, you know, obviously CG1, it's more of a recognition that a build two zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| bringing the building up to the, reinforcing the buildings to come up towards the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| is not appropriate in every location, and so that's why that one doesn't have a build two zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| It also doesn't allow quite as much intensity of use either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| It has a smaller maximum height, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| I was noticing that it seems like Bearden, which if we, just looking at Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| not the other parts, but the part of Kingston Pike where I was noticing the most CG1 is in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8407)|
| 2:20:17| where it's more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| And so I wasn't sure if there was, I'm not sure what the correlation if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| why there's more CG1 in that part of, on that part of Kingston Pike versus others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8424)|
| 2:20:33| Do you know any reasoning behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Community input negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| We in Bearden negotiated the CG1, and Commissioner Midas was part of the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8441)|
| 2:20:49| Well, I wouldn't say I supported it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| but I do think that Commissioner Hill was able to work with some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| Nonetheless, I think your primary concern, and I don't want to be adversarial here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| and I'm not, I'm on your side, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| I think your primary concern was the building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| I know you were concerned about 70 feet or unlimited in the CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8468)|
| 2:21:14| and so CG1 limited it to 40, Mike, is it 45 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| And I think you were worried about parking, and I think the CG1 for parking in front, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| So it's community input and a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| Is that fair, Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| But I do think that it's not as conducive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| I mean, in Bearden, we're walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| I mean, that was the whole idea of Bearden Village Council, is to develop a walkable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| And CG1 is not as good as CG2 and CG3, if you want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| That's my, in my opinion, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| Well, I think that, I had another question about the variance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8508)|
| 2:21:55| I think we've touched on that, and that being an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| The last thing that I'll just comment on it is that I think that I'm certainly for more walkable areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8520)|
| 2:22:13| and I'm certainly in favor of higher density, bringing buildings closer to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| and areas, hiding parking, and hopefully minimizing parking, the need and the number of parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8541)|
| 2:22:32| and becoming more transit, public transit dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| But I will say with this, the one thing that I think is helpful as a compromise in this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8559)|
| 2:22:49| is just the fact that it is limited to certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| There's a cutoff point, and some parts will remain with these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8572)|
| 2:23:01| So I do think that that's a decent compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| and I appreciate Commissioner Schelso's comments of maybe looking at where that cutoff happens a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8585)|
| 2:23:15| with some other precision, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| And so not making any motion or necessarily committing to anything right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8598)|
| 2:23:25| but I certainly do think that it's a good starting point to not make it just a wide blanket change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8605)|
| 2:23:36| and to look at it in specific areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Question for Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| Jeff, TDOT has minimum standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Nothing prevents a municipality from having more extensive requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8631)|
| 2:23:59| State TDOT has their minimum standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| The cities, with negotiation with TDOT, can potentially request for more stricter standards if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8643)|
| 2:24:10| But that's a negotiation in part between the jurisdiction and the TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| That's traditionally the way it's been for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| But these standards are established statewide across all the state highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221006?start=8656)|
