| 0:00:37| Commissioner Wright, Commissioner DeFries, Commissioner Pinkston, 11 members are back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=37)|
| 0:00:50| from lunch. There's a couple more. Joy McCroskey, Martha Phillips office. We'll move on to Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=50)|
| 0:01:05| Jones, Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=65)|
| 0:01:36| Commissioner, I'm Mark Jones with the Health Department and I'm available for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| Commissioner Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Just a few questions here. I'm looking at page 79 of the online version and there's a $3,000 increase in employee travel and I'm just wondering what's that about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=102)|
| 0:02:02| One thing I don't have and the one thing I'm going to apologize for, my page numbers don't line up with your page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| So if I knew what that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Well, it's a Food and Restaurant Inspection...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Okay, I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Page 79, 9370 is the item number line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Yes, sir. I know which one that is. Commissioner, that is a program that we are required to train our employees with the state. It's part of the inspection program and to maintain consistency in the way we do the restaurant and food inspections, we're required to attend training sessions down in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=139)|
| 0:02:45| And I think we were a little bit...we didn't have enough money in the budget last year to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| So that's also a revenue generating contract with the state, too. We almost cover the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=171)|
| 0:03:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| The other thing is page 93 of the online version, Vector Control Services, which is a nicer way of saying something other than insects and rodents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| More than a $50,000 increase and disease prevention, also a big increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| I understand the value of preventative. Is that what this is about, why we're going up so much in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| I think if you look at the whole budget, we've not gone up overall in all of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| What we've done, any place where we've increased our budget, we have reduced the budget somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| For Vector Control, I think that budget's about $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| We do a tremendous amount of work in this county with part-time workers for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| And again, I compare our program with the program in Memphis-Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| We do an equivalent amount of work. Their budget's well over a million dollars down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| I don't think that budget, I'm a little surprised, I didn't think that budget increased any at all from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=240)|
| 0:04:11| Again, it's up $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| It's another example of, we also partner with Halsedale PAL in a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Halsedale PAL funds some of this program also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| They actually give us about $10,000, $15,000, I believe, a year to provide services in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| They either buy the chemicals or they pay part of the labor costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Well, again, in the interest of prevention, it probably makes sense, but I just needed the details, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Commissioner Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Mark, I'd asked you about this the other day, and I don't know if you can give me specifics on just the mosquito abatement program itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| What's the dollar figure on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| The whole program's about $170,000 a year, and that includes everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Some years it's a little less because of the cost of the chemicals, and sometimes we have a little left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Well, related to that, I'd asked about your opinion on it, and Ronnie Neese, I talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| and he was very helpful on the effectiveness of that and how you feel that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Considering the way it's emitted through a grid system and just driving on the streets and spraying, what is your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| I think, Commissioner, it's got two parts to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| I think what we do and the way we treat stand-in water on public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| and then in some areas where we have permission of landowners where we go on and treat for mosquito abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=337)|
| 0:05:47| It's not the spraying, but that's actual treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| It's a very safe type of insecticide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| It's not an insecticide, but it's a chemical that we use that's very environmental friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| I think that's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| The second part of that is the spray that we use in the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| and, again, there has to be contact with the mosquito for that to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| So if there's not contact, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| So that one probably has some varying degrees of efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Just by the way, what is the name of that chemical that's sprayed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| It's the tip of my tongue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| I can't remember either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| If I could maybe hit that in my brain again in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| I have an almond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| It's called RAID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| That's not RAID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| I've almost got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Mark, how many cars do you have in your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| I think overall, Commissioner, we have probably about 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| The auto allowance is strictly in your department, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| I see you've got $2,800 auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| We have actually three departments that use cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| We have our environmental sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| Our restaurant inspectors have cars that are about 10 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and then our groundwater inspection crew have some vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| And then we have the mosquito control trucks we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| And then our home visiting staff also have some cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| And we have a couple cars that we, anyone that's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| one of them is one of the high mileage cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Anyone going to Nashville, we use that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Anyone taking troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| You had answered some of these questions before for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| but one of the questions I had, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| has to do kind of with some of the communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| and IT amounts that were budgeted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| And I want to say this is under diagnostic services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| They've got communications and ITs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Last year's actual was $88.61,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| and then the budget recommended for the current year is $25,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=516)|
| 0:08:45| And the year-to-date actual is only $20.57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and then it's recommended $20,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| I don't know how or where you can find that because it took me forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| but I'm just confused as to why you've spent less than $100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| but yet the budget request is for $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| I think that's explainable by a coding issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| We have a physician that does the reading, over-reading of x-rays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| He bills his service as electronic communications services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| finance posted under communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| We had budgeted under other related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| We had budgeted under other professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| So like the next line down where it says other services related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| that's where you've got it delineated out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| I have the physician services under other professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Then under other services related, we have equipment lease in that particular department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| We also have equipment maintenance, 9325.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| Those are all concerning our x-ray machines and our laboratory machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| electronic analyzers and so forth that we utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I guess that that needs to be corrected then because I think communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| and IT we've been really using for phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| Normally our communications charges are what charges we get through PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| It just so happens this budget got a little mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Because then where it's got, you know, your other services related, that's under budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| because it's got your last year's actual at $28,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and the current year's budgeting $5,000 and you've already spent double that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and they're budgeting another $5,000 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| So that doesn't add up either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| That needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| We will correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| Now your equipment costs, those are, do you think that that's budgeted accurately then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| Are you speaking of the equipment maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Well, just right above communications and IT, 9325 is the account number that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| It's got equipment, $42,668.27 that was last year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| The current year we're only budgeting $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| You've actually spent $25,810 and they're recommending $29,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| Our recommendation for $29,500 should be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| So that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| So there's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| I had another question with regard to primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| You have other services related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Last year's actual was $10 and then in the current year it was budgeted $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| You've spent $139,000 and then next year it's got $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| Now does that have to do with Lisa Ross that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| No, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| That has to do with the Cherokee contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Okay, the Cherokee contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| And what that is, it's a contingency fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| That's an incentive contract with Cherokee health systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| to provide the services at a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| And that was put in there, and I think we went over about $139,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Are we going to go over more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| We're going to go over probably, but it's going to be less than $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| And the reason we're recommending that, well, that was on the March agenda actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| That part was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| That contract for indigent care is still kind of a slippery slope right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| and it can go up or it can go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| And, again, we feel like we can maintain the same level of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| but at least we wouldn't need that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| There's a good chance, again, I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| I don't think we'll need it all, but we could depending on what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Commissioner, the name of that chemical was biomass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Sorry, I'm a little slow, but I finally got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Biomist is the name of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| You threw Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Well, I had another question, but I'll have to find it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So go ahead and move on to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Mark, are you going to be assuming custodial responsibilities, oversight of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| and grounds work at the health department, much like the library is planning on doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Commissioner, that's my understanding right now with the RFP out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| I thought I heard that earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I just wanted to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Yes, this is a follow-up question of what was just mentioned about the contract with Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Under the code there for indigent medical care, it's $5,250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Is that the Cherokee contract, or is that something different under indigent medical care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Commissioner, that was the contract that was on the March agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| And it's not just what happens in that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| The health department gets 27% of the money from that to actually operate indigent care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| That comes out to about $1.365 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| That 27% is what we use to contract with Cherokee Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| The other parts to that contract is shared with the hospital emergency rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| and also with the specialty physicians that are referred out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| We actually do that from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| If a patient at Cherokee needs a specialty physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| then it comes back to the health department to refer it out through our network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| That physician is able to bill somewhere probably on the neighborhood of 20% or 25% of the normal charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| but that comes out of the rest of that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| So that comes out of the indigent medical care funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Under 9305, medical and dental indigent care, could you explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=933)|
| 0:15:47| Again, one of my problems is my numbers don't match up, but it's under the dental department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Under medical and dental indigent care, it's under unit number 1005424.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=953)|
| 0:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| That is the indigent care contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| That's the total amount that's allocated for indigent care services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| The year to date, is that from January or is that from fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| Gary Acuff here says that's one quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| The reason that's one quarter is we pay that out on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Speak into the mic if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| The reason that's only one quarter is we pay it out on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| However, the amount of money is not distributed until 60 days after the end of the quarter, according to the IC contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| So, Mark, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Last year's budget was $5.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| This year you're asking for the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Do you think with the fact that the economy is the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| do you think that's a realistic number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| We do, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Actually, by the way the contract is set up, this is a contract that it's remained the same amount for more than eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| It was on March's agenda, and what we have to do, in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| it requires us to get commission approval early for this amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| But we do think the way we've got it planned, we're going to continue to operate at that same level of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| Yes, to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| One thing I just want clarification for, and then I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| What exactly are vector control services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| We do a couple different things in that program, maybe three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| In the ordinance there's a public health law, public health nuisance law, which has to do with rodents or flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:08| We sometimes use the staff for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| But the primary focus is mosquito abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| My question then is last year's actual full-time pay for that is $28,000 and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| This year you're requesting $68,856.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| So that's an increase of about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| What we do in that program, the program was set up not to be a full-time program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| We have six part-time employees, and what's happened is we used one person kind of around the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| and we converted the one part-time position during the year last year to a full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| And we have this gentleman doing various things throughout the health department for the environmental staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Can I ask one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Another question I have has to do with community health services, and it's unit 15463.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| And the regular pay in last year's was $268,296.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:33| And then this year we're requesting $753,522.08, and that's about $500,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:43| Can you explain the half a million in salary increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Commissioner, it might be in the 07, but the budget for that department would have been the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| It's really relative to about the same amount as this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Can you explain then, because this year's is 826.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| So it did increase $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| So can you explain the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| From 07, from the 07 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| I can, and I'm very happy to explain the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| The focus of the health department has been, historically, it's been in providing clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| And once we changed the focus with primary care, once Cherokee Health System stepped forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| and provided, were able to provide a service, even additional services that we couldn't provide for that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| we changed our focus, and year before last, we asked for 10 extra positions in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| That really, it's positions that go out, and our focus is on prevention and health promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| And it's so far, you know, these are long-term goals for reducing disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1253)|
| 0:21:02| and premature death in this community, but that's what the focus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| So this goes to pay physician salaries, then, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Physician? No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| It's not physician salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| It's health promotion, health educators, epidemiologists, health planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| These are not, per se, Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| They're people that you contract with, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Well, we have, on that budget, we have 15 Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and there's approximately 10 employees in that department that are grant employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Frances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you, Ms. Fogerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Human Resources and Benefits, unit number is 1003610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:05| Answer any questions you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| No, I'm sure someone is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| She tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I think Mr. Lockett wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I've talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Oh, you've got him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| He was next on the list, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:46| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Bill Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| I appreciate the opportunity to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I'm not going to take much time, add to your already lengthy agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| but I do understand that there were some questions this morning about funding for the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| that I hopefully anticipate leading after September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| so I wanted to come down and present myself to see if any commissioners had any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:21| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Mr. Lockett, there was a question about the added position for a secretary for you for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:36| I think changing it from 18 to 19 positions, if I believe that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| In this day, with the way that this budget and the concerns that we all have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| with trying to stay lean and mean, I don't know who's going to be there come September 1 and who's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| but is it possible that if you don't need to go to 19 in order to have this position filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| would you continue to have it at 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| If I understand your question, Commissioner, are you asking me do I still serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| Well, I'm not asking if you're going to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| but what I'm asking you is if when you come in there's only, say, 17 of the 18 positions filled at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| and you want to bring this person in, which you have every right to do being that office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| would you think that you still need to go to 19 or do you think you could run the office with 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| I think I could run it on 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| It would depend, however, on what individual left the office to create the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| And I appreciate that answer, but I just want to know that if it's that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| do you feel like you needed all the positions that are there plus one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| or if you felt like you could run this office with the right 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| With the right 18, I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Let me explain what I mean by my answer so all of you will understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| I've had some discussions with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| and he kindly presented me with resumes and job descriptions for every employee in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:33| And said to me in a written communication with that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| that each one of those individuals wanted to remain in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| The two who were excluded at that time were Mr. Owens himself and his chief deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:55| So it was everyone who was in the office at that time besides those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| It is my understanding that recently a third individual is no longer with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:14| But that was an attorney, not a support personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| It is not my intention to go into that office and terminate anyone's employment when I take office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:29| So it is my understanding that as we speak today, all support personnel want to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| and I have no intention of terminating anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I do want and think it proper that I hire my chosen person as my legal secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:57| And that's why this number is in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And I appreciate that and don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| I just want to make sure that if between now and then a position comparable to that were to come open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| don't know why it would, but just in case, do you feel like you could operate that office with 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Commissioner Lutho, I believe it's just 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Well, whatever that number is, if it's 18, 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| We've got 16 and they've put in for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| What I wanted to tell you, Mr. Lockett, is nobody is down on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| We're questioning all these new positions because we're supposed to have a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| That's what all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| You haven't had a chance to look over the law director's budget, I don't guess, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| No, sir, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I was wondering if maybe you could find it possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Let me tell you, though, I did not have an opportunity to in any way participate in creating that budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:07| but I have looked at it and studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| That's understandable, but I believe you said he's raising it 42,000 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| I think that was the new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| That would be the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| I think salary plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| John Troyer, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| The salary was 42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Salary is 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Then the other cost of employment would be on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| What I was going to ask you, do you think you might be able to look at the budget less this 42,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| and still find revenue there to maybe hire this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| All I can say is that I can try, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| From looking at the budget, there were no additional requests in the budget over the previous year, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1734)|
| 0:29:05| It was pretty similar to the previous year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| Well, you're definitely going to be hurting when you have to get outside legal experience, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| I don't know what's going to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| That's my hope, that we won't have to do that very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| That's going to be out of your control, though, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Well, it will in conflict situations, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| But anyway, if you get a chance, I'd like you to look over it before we approve this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| and come back and tell us you think you might be able to cut that 42 out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I didn't want to insinuate myself into the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| I didn't think that was my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I obviously have no official position with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| The only reason I came down was because it was my understanding from a friendly phone call that the issue had come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| And I appreciate the opportunity just to present myself to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| And because you've requested it, Commissioner, I'll be happy to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| We're not disquestioning you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| There was another position come up because we're supposed to be in a hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| and I can understand why you would want your secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| You've worked with her well, I'm sure, for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| And, you know, she knows what you want, and I can understand you wanting to bring her with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| Well, this isn't even, just so it's clear, I've requested this in the budget so that I could hire a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| It needs to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I haven't, I work at a firm I've been at for 21 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| and I'm not going to raid that firm in terms of support personnel or attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| But I want the opportunity to hire an individual, and so it needed to be in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| And that's the reason I made this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Bill, congratulations on your win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| But as we ask people to cut, I mean, the government is going to have to go and adopt this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| And you just said you didn't have anybody in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| You just need that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Is there not a position right now that Mr. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| or someone else that has a secretary up there or they don't have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| I assume that Mr. Owens has a secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| and I've been given information about what individuals in that office do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| My point, Scott, is that I'm coming in to run the law office for Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| this commission and every other department in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| And I also don't think it's proper for me to just walk in and start telling people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| you don't have a job because you work for John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| A lot of people have been up there for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| and I think have done a good job for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| But by the same token, I think as the individual who is going to lead that office for the next four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| it's important to me to hire my right arm and the person that I'll look to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| to handle things the way I think that they should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And that's why I think it's proper that I hire my chosen individual to work as my executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:36| I understand what you're saying, but if everyone else did the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| if Sheriff Jones did it, someone else did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| then we've increased county government by 20 or 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| And in two years in 2010, nobody wants to get rid of anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| and we change office orders again and we have to add 20 or 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| And that's where the big, this is where it really hurts us on personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| People is what cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| I understand and believe me, I am sympathetic to the plight that commission finds itself in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| with budget being what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I think there's a little difference, though, in the example that you gave with Sheriff Jones and with Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| Mr. Owens had been in the law department for 17 years, knew every individual in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and had worked with them for a lengthy period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Same thing with Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I'm going into an office where all of those people have worked with John Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| who will be leaving office for that length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and it's important to me to have an individual that I choose, again, to work with me as my secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:46| I think it will pay for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I think there will be efficiencies achieved by virtue of the fact that I am picking the person to do things the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| that I think they need to be done for me to be able to do the job that I've been elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| I understand, but if you could, before we approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| if you could look at the budget and see if there's somewhere else that you can cut the $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| I mean, you've got one attorney that's already left, and you're going to have Mary Ann's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| Just see if you could hire somebody at a lower rate maybe to be an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I'm going to hire a chief deputy, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and I'm going to hire an individual of a caliber that I do not anticipate cutting the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| I'm going to hire an individual who has the level of experience and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:40| and expertise that they deserve the pay that the current chief deputy is receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| Actually, I have an individual in mind that has a huge amount of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| has served as a county law director in Polk County, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| has written extensively on county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| and I think that individual would do a great job for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| and I will not ask them to assume that very important position at a lesser salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| I am aware, as you mentioned, that another attorney has left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| but I don't think that office can afford to be short an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| I may wait and see, but I really don't think, unless this commission thinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| that removing an attorney's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| No, I didn't say remove anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I said if you can find somebody at a reduced rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| if you could take $10,000 or $15,000 out of their pay and put it into your new position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| or if you can take it out of contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| or if you can take it out of somewhere else within the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| because I think when this budget is done, I mean, I don't see this budget right here passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| barring $40-something million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| So, I mean, there may be additional cuts that have to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| and we're going to have to try to get everybody across the board somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Well, I will commit to you and Commissioner Pinkston and the entire commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| to look and see what I can come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| and come back at the appropriate time and tell you what I've found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| That's all we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| And I appreciate, again, the opportunity, if there's any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| I am in agreement with Commissioner Moore in that if we keep kind of hiring different layers as people come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:42| I think that's a very dangerous position to put the county in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And, again, just taking a cursory look at it, it looks as if, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| John Owens told us that I guess each lawyer has an administrative person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| So we're talking about Commissioner Owens' administrative person staying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| Commissioner Stackhouse's administrative person being there for some time until you can make that hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:13| and then this open position that you're not planning on filling have an administrative person there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| So it seems like there's a lot of administrative people that are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| and I don't know what you plan on doing if you're going to bring in your own administrative person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| what the present person serving John Owens is going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| I'm sure you're going to reallocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| But it looks to me, again, at face value, that walking into it on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| you'll be fairly top heavy from an administrative personnel standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| And, again, so my question to John Owens, I guess, and John Troyer was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| have you looked at the daily operations of how the ends, ways, and means of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| and have you used that to justify this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| I know you want to bring in people that you trust, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| these are trying times in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| These aren't times where we can keep things status quo and lay on additional layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| So my question to you is, have you looked at the daily operations of the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| what changes you're going to make, and that led you to add this additional person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Was that the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Or was it just, I just want my own person, I guess, just to be blunt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| And I'll be just as blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Yes, I do want my own person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| But having said that, I have looked at the daily operations of the law director's office as much as I have been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| And that's no criticism of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| It's just to say I'm not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| So all I can do is make certain assumptions about the day-to-day operations of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| I will say that I have met with three attorneys in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| I had a conversation with Mr. Owings and told him that that's what I intended to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| and he concurred that that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I told him that I wanted to call, invite them to lunch, talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| And I've done that for the purpose of gauging their interest in remaining in the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| talking to them about their day-to-day activities, what types of cases they work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| what they feel they are best at in terms of their legal expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| And I have expressed to those three that I want them to stay on, and all three of them have agreed to remain in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| So I've taken steps to familiarize myself with the day-to-day operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| It has been stated to me by some members of Knox County government that they feel that that office is not top-heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| but that it could use additional attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| But I do not intend to do anything in that regard in terms of asking for funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| obviously for an additional attorney because of the present status of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| We're just going to buckle down and work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| But an administrative person will take some of that load, I think, at a lesser salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| and you'll be able to accomplish more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Again, I've taken too much time already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I do want to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| I don't see any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Larry Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| If it's not too much, could I ask Frances to come back up here for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| I'm sorry I didn't catch this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Is retirement operations under your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| I didn't need you up here after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| You can look two seats down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| What I'd like to do is just read you an introduction and then open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| The Knox County Public Library Administration is supportive of the $12.9 million budget for the 2008-09 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| The Knox County Public Library system consists of the Lawson McGee Central Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| the McClellan Collection, 17 branches, and the Beck Cultural Center Research Library and Archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| I wanted to note that the McClellan Collection comprises over 85 percent of the East Tennessee History Center building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| that also includes county archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| The East Tennessee Historical Society operates the museum portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Collections are fundamental to library services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| The average costs of books have risen from the mid-teens in 2003 to the $30 to $40 range in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| for trade hardcovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Periodical and audiovisual materials have increased over 30 percent during the same period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| Rising costs for publishers have caused decrease in discounts as much as 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| High technology and database costs as primary keys to access on all levels are also increasing substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| Our library system has consistently done more with less compared with the national average of $23 to $29 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:18| budgets for our size system, and we will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Yesterday we had the Children's Festival of Reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| We had donations of $38,000, corporate donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| The reason we've gotten such national press and exposure and such high ratings nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| is through our corporate donations, and I have a superlative staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| They do an excellent job, and the support that we get as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| and the acclaim we get as a result of that corporate support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| and that's why we've been able to be so successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| What's the unit number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I wanted to ask John Troyer some questions about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| I noticed that there was earmarked for last year's actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| It says contract with others at nearly $2 million, and then there's nothing else in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Can you please explain that relabeling method that you did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| It's a PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Mr. Troyer, can you tell us what the unit number is for the library services, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| It started 205 and starts at 205-001L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I'm looking at account number 9360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And that would probably be the space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| It would be the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| That's the utilities, custodial, loan maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| But wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| It says $1,941,148, and that was last year's actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| There's nothing in that category for the current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| There's nothing there for the year-to-date actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| There's nothing there for recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Nothing there for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| How did you diminish $2 million that we spent last year, and how did it not arrive somewhere in the budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| I mean, I know that you do some creative relabeling because you've been doing it the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I would just like to know where $2 million went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| What you have to look at is look further at the detail, and you'll see the subcodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Last year we were showing it out of a no subcode in its contract with PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| and in the current year we are showing a subcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And part of that money, a big piece of that money, and I think this is something that's very important to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| part of the struggle with the library is that they have been tasked with more responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| at about the same budget for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Included in that is an expanded responsibility on the historical center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| expanded responsibility on the Beck Center, and expanded responsibility on more branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| All of this under the context of about the same budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| A couple of things that are not in the library budget this year that I think are important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| The Beck Center budget is not under the library's budget, and it's included in the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| Also, there's another $500,000, which is the PBA's charge to operate the East Tennessee History Center building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| and that's also under the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| And so that's relief for the library department to be able to have a budget that doesn't include those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| And so we're trying our best to try to help the libraries in a tough budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| Well, I commend those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Now, I want to ask something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| How in the world, okay, I use the library frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I know that checkouts now have been reduced now to two weeks instead of three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| And I know that in order to streamline some purchasing of materials, that has been all centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| And so now a lot of the materials have to be transferred from one branch to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| And I know that the vans, I don't know, and I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| A lot of these questions are going to be for John Troyer, but Mayor Frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| I would like to know how much of an increase has there been in the vans traveling from one library branch to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| just to get the materials all around and share the materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| It's been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| We transfer 70,000 materials a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Among the branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| And so that takes a lot of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| And gas and the car maintenance, that has to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| John Troyer, my question for you is how do you account in the budget, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| How do we account in the budget for the same amount for the actual 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| only being slightly more for the proposed fiscal year 2009 with such an increase in transporting materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| Part of what we're doing and part of what's not in there is the East Tennessee History Center is included in a separate budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| And also, yeah, let's go back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| We're making the same trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| We're just loading that van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| We're making the same trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| One of the things that we're alluding to here and one of the reasons why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| one of the things that I encountered when I first came here that I think directly reflects on your question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| we do not have full service branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Therefore, we have to transfer materials more simply because it's a limited budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| We've had to design, I've had to design the system so that it's more thematic and subject-oriented for the branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| We just don't have the resources to have them full service to give everyone everything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| So we do have to have much more transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| But even on the item for gasoline, 9415, how could you go from only $8,000 last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:53| and only recommend $10,000 for gasoline this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| So far, I mean, year-to-date numbers were about $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| and I think you had a statement from Mr. Frank also that they would do their best to try to make this budget work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| recognizing that we're in difficult economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| So you mean they've already used $4,000 this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| That was halfway through the year, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| There's something else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I'd also like to mention that line item 9360 with the subcode zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| you mentioned the $1,941,000 of the prior year actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| That's the current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| It's in the same 9360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| It's just subcode number 50, and it shows $1,955,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| So almost the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| And the proposed number of $1,436,000 is virtually identical to the number without the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| What is the ñ is this community service contracts on item ñ account number 9335 with subcode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2931)|
| 0:49:03| Community services contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| There's a hundred and ñ what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Community service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| That is Metro Ethernet, and that's also telephone bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| That's the Internet for Internet access throughout the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| We've cut it every single different way we could, and we have scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| And the fact that you brought up energy costs and so forth, we're cutting into the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| And the only way we can go from here on is look at where do we cut back in terms of branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| We're that tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| We're honestly that tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| So this ñ but the community service contracts last year were $75,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| and then recommended this year is $190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Is that because of the increase of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| Bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| How much do we have allocated for the purchase of new materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| We have this next year, I believe it's $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| That takes it back to 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| In 2003, we had a $1.6 million budget, and then we adjusted that with a 6% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| The challenge we have for the collections is once you do not buy for a particular year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| many of those materials go out of print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| And we've already done damage to the infrastructure of our collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| So what we have to do, what we're trying to do, is play a game of catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Do you feel that that's enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| We could always use more, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| It's a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| The current year's budget is $518,000, and the proposed is $2,031,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| So we've done a lot to add more money to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| because we think the collection is very, very important, but there's only so much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| I'm glad to see it go back up to where it probably should have been all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and hope that as we go in the future we keep it up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and increase it so that we don't have to do damage control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| So in terms of staffing, are you going to be more or less 2009 than you are in 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:27| When I first came on, we had more staff, and we've trimmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:38| With the position freeze, depending on what the position is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| it will affect hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| But I'm assuming with the most recent memo from Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| that if it's a critical position, we will be able to advertise for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| But we're at a critical stage with staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| We're understaffed for the size system that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| But we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| My staff does a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| In terms of the East Tennessee Historical Center, the McClung Collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| do you have staff that work for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| For the McClung Collection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| We've got an entire staff, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Okay, so that's just the archivists, or do they work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| We have a substantial genealogy collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| In fact, I have Steve Cottom here, who's the head of the East Tennessee History Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| that could give you a breakdown of what it consists of if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Yeah, if you don't mind, just write quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| I think there's some confusion about who and what the McClung Collection is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| but it's the public library's history and genealogy collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| We have two departments of the library in the History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| One is the McClung Collection, which is a traditional book and microfilm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| newspapers, all kinds of historical resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| That has been part of the public library since it was created in 1921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| The public library goes back to 1885.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| It just so happens that when we needed space a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| the library was lucky enough to get the History Center deeded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| the Custom House deeded to it to become a History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| We have 25 staff in the McClung Collection who do a lot of different kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| from digitizing photographs, working with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| We're open seven days a week, two nights, Saturday, Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| We have a staff of six in the archives, the Knox County archives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| and those are Knox County's permanent historic value records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| The ones that are not here in the city county building are in the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Those two departments are part of the public library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| There's some confusion, I think, in people's minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| because of the name of the building as to who funds what within the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| but we're partners with the East Tennessee Historical Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| which is a private nonprofit organization which is not funded by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| So then my last question, in terms of the back budget that's been taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| I guess zeroed from your account and taken out of Hotel Motel, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| Yes, but we still have staffing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| We have for the research library and center, we have archivists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| and we have people helping from our cataloging department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| technical services to assist in the collection development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| So those people are under the employment of the library system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| but we do use them for the Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Last question is what's going to happen to the other staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Which staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| There were Beck staff, I guess, that were library employees last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| They would be under the Hotel Motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| In other words, that's how they would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| So they would be funded through the Beck Center as a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Okay, so is this for staff or is this a grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| Staff and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| It would be a grant for their operations, including their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| So they would spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| But in terms of the space and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| we're not going to roll the RFP doesn't include Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:40| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| The Beck Center would handle their own custodial loan maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| under the contracts as they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| Motion to round three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Frank, could you tell us which branch libraries are the most heavily visited, the top two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| and which two are the least visited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Or can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| If not, I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Cedar Bluff is the most used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| and it's a very close tie between Powell and West Knoxville for second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Farragut is up in that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| The least used are probably Murphy and Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| I want to say, as your representative in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| the Powell Library has been very well received out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| and every time I drive by there, the parking lot, and it's a large parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| it's at least half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| The gentleman next to you uses it regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| The staff out there has been very accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| How much money, John, was taken out of last year's budget of the library for the Beck Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| What was that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| In round numbers, it's about $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| about half of which was the PBA contract for maintenance of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| So what the proposal is is just to give them the net of $200,000 as a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| So that would have brought last year's budget down to about $12 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:35| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| And this year it's $12.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| You know, I know everybody does a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| but when we're holding the engineering department, our roads, our bridges, our paving, traffic control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:52| we're funding them less than we did the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| We need to look at holding the line to other departments the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| not increasing them almost a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And I know you could use the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| But is libraries more important than paved roads and bridge maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| I think you're comparing apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| But in terms of the budget, we've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| In fact, John and I have had some very good discussions as to where we could cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:30| And one of the things that we've reviewed, of course, that you've reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| is the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and where we could finagle as much as we can and handle certain things ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:48| How much do you think you could save doing it yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| It depends on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| If it's the utilities for the main library, it was $364,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| According to PBA, according to KUB, it was $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| So they charged us $114,000 to pay our utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| So you might be able to save a substantial amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| But even though I say that and bring that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I think the finance department and the libraries worked very closely together to see where we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| We already are at a 12-point, you know, we already have this $12 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| We are half the national average, and we're trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| The major things we could do would be to close branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| That's how we would cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| That would have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And that's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| You know, we've got a bunch of tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Based on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| But, you know, I think if we ask people to hold the line, then we ought to do it across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I mean, the state of Tennessee had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I'm sure Governor Bredesen didn't like laying off 2,000 state employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| But, you know, at some point in time, you know, we can only do so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| So, you know, over the next couple of weeks, I mean, I'd like to see what you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| in reducing trying to get back to where you were in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Commissioner Moore, in all respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| they have been working on a skeleton budget for years because of PBA being a money monger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| But PBA, I talked to John Troyer, and he said that you were in the process of doing a two-step cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:38| Correct, John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| The first was going to be a cut in lawn care, cleaning facilities, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| But how come that was only a savings of about $500,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Why is PBA still charging $1,436,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| They're not charging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| What are they charging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| They're still charging at least $1.5 million, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Yeah, but that includes PBA's charges as well as the contracts for custodial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| the contracts for lawn maintenance, and our expected cost of utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| And all the utilities went up across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Now, if PBA, is PBA going to do those, or are you going to do those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| The county is going to do the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| The county is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| But now why did you allow the Beck Cultural Center to take on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| Do you think that their staff is more specialized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| I think it's a bigger decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| and I think that the county is best served to give the Beck Center a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and allow it to have its own independent operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Yeah, just as a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Now, last year all that together cost $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| This year the county has only given back $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| So they've basically done away with that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| So Beck has to do that on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| On their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Utilities and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| But they're saying that they're going to give Beck Cultural Center the operational control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| and divide it by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Divide it by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| But what we just heard from the library director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| it sounds like PBA is multiplying by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I have yet to see what the county is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Let me place this within context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| In order to, as a management service, they incur administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| At the same time, the energy costs are going up across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| Utility costs are going up across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| The question is, and my experience has been, as I think of a cartoon in Wisconsin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:54| with the state library, people were wanting money directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| and it showed Santa Claus with a big pot saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| and it showed the homeless next to him with a tin cup saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| eliminate the middle man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I guess what I'm saying is there's always that feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| but many times they do save on certain aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| The question that we have is trying to walk the line and massage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| so that we're making it the most cost effective and efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| All I'm saying today is we're cutting into the bone, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| We have a skeleton budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| The question then is where do we cut back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| and where would the commission like us to cut back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| This was just really a follow-up question to what we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| with the Vet Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| They had a budget last year of approximately $400,000, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| And so we are not going to provide them with a contract with PBA at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| They were not happy with PBA and we proposed that they not employ PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| So security and all those other things have been excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| and we're just giving them a $200,000 grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Yes, that's our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Not final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Yes, Mr. Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| First I want to echo everything that Commissioner Roundtree said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| and I also want to add that you've got a smoking fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Internet connection there at the Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| The Wi-Fi system, as far as public Wi-Fi systems, that's one of the best in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| But I wanted to ask, have you considered adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I'm not sure how we would do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| but have you considered subleasing some of your space to perhaps some coffee shops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| I know that's been tried downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| but there seems to be a lot of coffee shops in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| and I'm wondering if maybe in suburban areas whether subleasing some space to a coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| might help benefit some libraries like your Powell Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Have you considered doing something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Yes, we did, and we're still considering options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| We have very limited space in the branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| They're very small branches, relatively speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| but we have looked into the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And we try to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| For many vendors, what they look at is what is the return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| how much are they going to invest and what is the return on their investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| And many places are not selected simply because they don't feel the location will generate enough traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Also, have you set up any sort of a wish list through a vendor like Amazon, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| something maybe that you could advertise and if there were materials that you were needing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| that a person could go online and make that purchase and have the books sent to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Have you considered that sort of thing to help supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Because I know Air Powell Branch Library is fairly new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| but we've got a really large building there and we don't have a lot of books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| I'm going to have to agree with Ms. DeFreeze that I believe that the materials budget needs to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| because we've got some really nice buildings that aren't filled with materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| And I'm wondering, have you considered doing something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| where on a book-by-book basis citizens could log on to the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| purchase a book that would then be sent to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| We're looking at a number of scenarios where we could incorporate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| The contractual arrangements have so far tended not to be in favor of the public entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| so we're trying to work around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| One of the reasons that the Cedar Bluff Branch is so high in attendance is because of my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| I think she's there three or four times a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| and so thank you for accommodating her and everyone else that goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| But I wanted to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| You piqued my interest here on this utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Would you give me that figure one more time of what the actual bill was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| and what public building authority charged you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| It's approximately, just for the main library, $364,000 PBA charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| and the utility bills that we received a copy of from KUB indicated a quarter of a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| John, have you done an analysis of, or has anybody done an analysis of PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| and how much they are charging for these services with regards to the actual cost plus what the add-on is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| Part of the answer is yes, exactly what you say, is that they allocate their overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| and as we had previously asked them to pay the county's utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| then we were allocated overhead based on utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| We're pulling that back, and there shouldn't be overhead allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Part of the answer is that PBA is getting paid based on planned utility bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| rather than actual utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| So if the budget on the PBA side expects a certain amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| then we prepay it at the start of every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| So at the end of the year, we do settle up, and occasionally we do get some money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| And the short answer is that this is something that we could do, should do, and plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| So who will be paying the utility bills now, the finance department or the library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| The finance department will pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| What we wanted to avoid, and that's something that we're going to work with Larry very closely on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| but we want to make sure that we get, because there's usually a very, very short window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| in order to pay your utility bills, and we feel like if we get them, the finance department first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| then we can get the payment right out and meet the due dates and not have any late fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| I should ask PBA this, but who determines how much that they use for overhead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| In other words, who's in charge of PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| I guess ultimately we are, but are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| I mean, who's in charge of PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| We didn't get their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I mean, who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Dale Smith, and I'm sure he's not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| but I'm sure that you may want to discuss this with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| But the public billing authority has two clients, the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| and that's just what they do is what we ask them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| They have a board, and I guess the board oversees these things, votes on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| Who owns PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| It's the public billing authority of the city and county of Knoxville in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| So the city and the county, it's their public billing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| run for the benefit of the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| You have two clients, just two, and that's why they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| John, if we begin to take pieces of PBA's responsibility away from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:12| are they just going to transfer that overhead cost to other groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| In other words, if we take them away from the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| then are they just going to take those costs basically and transfer those over to others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| I mean, I don't see them reducing their staff a tremendous amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| And it goes back to public utilities like KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| They operate on basically a 12% return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| So obviously, you know, the more investment they have, the more money they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| the more money KUB has to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| So is that the same thing we're going to see with PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| I mean, what I don't want to do is take some of the cost that's been allocated across all business groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| in the county and then turn around and just add more of that to all the ones that are still involved with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| And I think that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| We have worked with PBA and we continue to work with PBA and also to work with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| because we can't just do this one client or the other client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| We have to do this together to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| And they understand and see our budget and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| And they understand and know that that means that their costs are going to need to cut also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| So it's happening very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Well, John, help me with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Obviously, they have a board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Who set up PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Did the city council and Knox County Commission set them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| Was that a resolution and it became a group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| How is it funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| It was originally set up by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| and there's state law that allowed us to set up a Knoxville-Knox County public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| And the first project that PBA did was to build the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| And so that was the vehicle that the city and the county could go in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| And through the PBA, like you heard Ms. Maines say today, that they own the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Well, PBA did a bond issue and signed a long-term lease agreement with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| and with the county in order to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| And so the city and county both promised to make the principal and interest payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| as well as the custodial, utilities, security, and all the costs that go with the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| Since then, the PBA has done some project management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| like they're doing the project management for Hardin Valley High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| and they have done some property management of which, you know, like the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| the health department, and senior centers, we're pulling some of that back now this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Daniels hit on some of the points I was getting ready to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| You know, PBA has an overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| We finally get their budget today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| and we're having to pay somehow divide it up, whether it's in space, rent, overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:22| whether they put it into a utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| I mean, they're just moving their costs around and charging the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| You know, we're looking at $2,000 for supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| I mean, we're looking at we're trying to cut everywhere we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| and I don't see PBA looking to try to save money here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| We had Del Smith come down here and he says, well, we won't save any money because they're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| they'll just shift their overhead to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| John, is that not what I hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| I mean, until they do something to cut their overhead, they're just going to just send it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:08| It's like pushing on a balloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| You can push it on one side and it just goes somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| Yeah, and I think that part of what we need to do is get Mr. Smith here to talk to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| and address to you, and part of it is, you know, what do we agree to pay PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| and what do we ask them to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| We need to look for savings every single place that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Well, I know that they're going to have fixed costs, costs that they can't adjust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| but I know there's got to be savings in being more cost efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| Methods that they can use, they're a valuable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I don't want to undermine the fact that they do provide a good service to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| and I'm sure to the city of Knoxville, but there has got to be some ways they can cut their overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| so that we don't have to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| I mean, because ultimately their cost is a taxpayer cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| So we need PBA to look at their budget and try to find ways to trim as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Mr. Troy, did I hear you say that the KUB bill, that they're paying late charges on KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| No, we want to avoid late charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Yes, Mr. Troy, I just heard you say that they also do, that PBA does project management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| and one of those was to include Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Could you please explain to me what exactly they're doing at Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| Jeff Gallion is the lead person and is representing the county's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and I don't want to talk too much about this without him being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| and I think we'd be better served to have Mr. Gallion or Mr. Smith say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| but in essence they're being the county's person on the scene overseeing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| And so there's an architect, there's a construction company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| and PBA is paid to be a facilitator of the different contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and PBA is also paid to be the county's person overseeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| Has that always occurred on various construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| or have we not used Mr. Weitrick's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| It has sometimes occurred and it's just project by project, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| so there's no general rule about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| And so I know PBA has worked with Mr. Weitrick's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| when they talk about different roads and different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| but I don't think there's been much overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Are we being charged to have PBA there as our liaison there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| Yeah, they were hired and the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I don't remember if the contract is with the county or with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| but they are being paid for it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| How much are they being paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| I'd have to go back and get documents for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| Okay, well I think it's important that we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| and I just don't see that it's necessary to pay PBA to have someone there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| when we have our own department, engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| that can oversee some of those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| Seeing no new lights, thank you, Mr. Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Mr. Frank, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| We have five more to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Martha Phillips and Joy McCroskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:51| Hello, I'm Joy McCroskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| This is Judge Richard Baumgardner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| He's going to help me out on some of this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| I'm willing to accept the budget that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| It's $25,000 less than last year for the three clerk's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| That's criminal, Fourth Circuit, and criminal sessions court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| And I think the judge wants to speak with you on one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I have one concern, and that is based on what I know is upcoming this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| which is somewhat of an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Last year's budget for witness and jury expenses was $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| That has been cut by 50% for this coming year to $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| I know, starting in August of this year, that we have four capital murder cases that we're going to try in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4730)|
| 1:19:01| Three of those cases currently have firm trial dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and I anticipate the fourth one will be sometime before the conclusion of the fiscal year upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:13| It will require in those cases to have sequestered juries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| It's estimated that each case will take three weeks, give or take, to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| And I just do not believe that it's realistic to think that a budget of $75,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| based on those circumstances, will be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| If it was a regular year, as a matter of fact, this year we have not spent that much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| and obviously we attempt to keep it at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| but based on the fact that we have these upcoming trials over which we have no control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| and we have no discretion with regard to whether or not there are sequestered juries or unsequestered juries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| because of the nature of the cases, I just wanted to bring that to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| because that's something that the county is going to have to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| and I didn't want you to be blindsided come February of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| when we've spent more money than is in the budget already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| So I just wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Judge Baumgartner, what would be an accurate figure do you think that we should budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Commissioner Davis, you know, the budget for last year was $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| We haven't spent but going on $40,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| But I would think with these cases, I haven't sat down with a calculator and done that math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:56| but I know, for instance, we've called around town, gotten the best rate we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| A motel room for one, we can get them for $83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| That's the best we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| So you take 15 people and two court officers to a motel for a night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| and you multiply 83 times 17 plus three meals a day, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| and then multiply that times three weeks times four trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| So we're talking a significant amount of money based on these upcoming cases that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| When you talk about sequestering a jury, does that include weekends as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Once you sequester a jury, they have to be together until the conclusion of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Now, we will work on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| We will work on Saturdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| and my intention would be to take Sunday off unless there's some extraordinary circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| But, yeah, you have to keep them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| How many trials do you say you're going to have, three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Four that currently have set trial dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Excuse me, three that currently have set trial dates, August of this year, January of next year, April of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| and the fourth one I anticipate will be set in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| Mr. Davis, I just figured out that not counting the meals, that comes out to $888,000 right there, not counting meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| That's not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| It's $14,000 a week basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| $88,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| He didn't mean $88,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| $88,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Mr. Ford, Commissioner Roundtree, you fell in short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| Judge Baumgartner, this question is really for Joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Joy, in the 12 years that I walked these halls, I continually noticed an increase in the Fourth Circuit court cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:49| Are you all still seeing an increase in the number of filings in that Fourth Circuit court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| In the orders of protection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| They're now working a lot of weeks, two days instead of just Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Two and three special masters each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| How many employees do you have in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| In Fourth Circuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| And there's sometimes 250 to 350 cases on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| On a Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Can you all get through with the docket at 4.30 or 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| What time do you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| They start at 8 o'clock down for orientation, and then the docket starts at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:47| I'm sure probably the long-term commissioners that are here sitting at this table today have seen the Thursday crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| I hope some of the new commissioners have had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Those girls do a yeoman's service down there for very little pay, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Very little, and we could double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| I do appreciate what they do, and I got to know those employees, and they're all good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:18| They're very hard workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Joy, you all do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| And I don't know if you can answer this question or who I need to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| but, like, when the courts find people, do we know what is actually owed to us, and do we know what is actually being collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:41| I don't have those figures with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| As you know, we've got a lot of indigents, and especially in the criminal and sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:56| And there is a new law, I am told, that passed several months ago that anybody taking out an order of protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| which is 95 percent of Four Circuit's work, cannot be made to pay the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| So that's almost a free court for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| What would you collect in revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I mean, from what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| From all the courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| Well, there's like 84,000 warrants a year filed in sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| and that's usually where we collect our money because these truck drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| and these people, they're going to pay their traffic tickets or lose their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| So that's fast coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| In criminal, they usually want to make cost agreements and pay by installment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Now, we still have that in sessions, but mainly that's criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| There's criminal, do we get something out of the fines in criminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Now, we can, our litigation taxes we get from the state and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| and then the prisons are beginning to collect because just because somebody is indigent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| doesn't mean we don't try to go after the court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| The prisons are collecting, and they will send us sometimes as little as 11 cents a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| Whatever that prisoner makes, we get a portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| It might take a while, but we will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And then our cost collections department is collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| We're doing garnishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| We were in bankruptcy, and that just, we didn't do any good there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| But we're going after what's owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| Maybe it's just a question for the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Yeah, get over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| What do you all do for somebody to be an indigent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| I mean, do you all look at their Beacon scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| or how does that figure into how someone becomes indigent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| We don't have a, we do not have an exact scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| In other words, what happens is they are required to fill out a financial affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| I look at that financial affidavit, or whatever judge it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| looks at that financial affidavit and determines whether or not in their judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| they can afford to hire a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| I'd say 80% of the people that come in who are asking for an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| will list on there either that they are unemployed or that they have disability income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| and that's the sole source of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| And then you'll have somebody who is employed who may have a $10 an hour job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| and they've got three kids at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| So we don't, you know, do we go out and investigate what those people have given to us in an affidavit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| No, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| But I think that would be very cost inefficient to hire somebody to verify the information that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| Well, the only problem you have are those people are probably not telling the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| or they wouldn't be in your courtroom in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| I haven't told the judges this, but last week we got together with a person from finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| and we are working on a program similar to like a doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| They ask you every time you come in if your address has changed, if your phone number has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| if your employment has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| We're looking at that and also at a way of tracking what they swear to on that affidavit is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:56| as to their salary, where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| And we're going back to try to find if they're not where they say they are, where they actually are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| so we can do more garnishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| And the judges aren't aware of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| We just started this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Is there a way, Joy, to get us that information, like how much is being collected here today in each court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| And do you collect other monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Court costs and fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Restitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| And restitution, but that goes to the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| But what about probation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Do you collect their probation fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Well, we collect it, but it goes to the probation office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| And can you get us a list of what's being collected here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| How long have you been with the criminal court, clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| Forty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Have you ever seen these costs go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| And what you're saying to this commission here then is this is not a correct figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| You need this money, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| You don't need this cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Okay, that's just what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| It seems like we're not getting facts on a lot of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| Just quickly . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Fails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| No, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Davis and I, by looking at the numbers that the judge gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| we're looking at somewhere between $120,000 and $150,000 just to sequester the juries for three trials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| not counting what it would take for possibly a fourth jury to be sequestered sometime before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| So it doesn't appear that 75 . . . was it 75 or 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| I don't think it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| I just don't think it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| I may not be the greatest mathematical mind in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| but I don't think $75,000 has a chance of covering what you're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:15| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Doug Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| I've just got three brief points to make, and I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| First, on our operating budget, the cuts we have from our proposed budget are spread fairly evenly throughout our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| so we don't see any great change to current services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Probably the biggest change is in capital dollars in terms of what we can do to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| and replace structures in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Obviously, that part of the program will slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Doug, what's your unit number so we can find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Park maintenance is $148.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| Recreation administration is $148.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And then our last one is county building maintenance, $160.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:15| What was the last one, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| $160.30 is county building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Second is Schumpert Park, which is the biggest increase to our budget, obviously opening up a new park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| We'll probably save some money in the projected budget there because of the wet spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| It does not look like it will be fully operational this fall, more than likely next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| So we're a little behind on construction there, so we're just going to miss that window on the positive side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| though we probably won't need to hire that full crew out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| just a couple of folks to go through, grow in, and do the typical maintenance there before we open for full operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| Some parts of the park will probably open this fall, but not the athletic fields, which is the big budget impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| And lastly, the one new program we had here, and I'm not too sure how to propose to proceed on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| but golf operations is the one we proposed bringing in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| So we've got 15 years of really good history up there through five different contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| The current contract will end at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| So the Greens Committee as well as some other groups have looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and really talked about bringing this in as an in-house operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| And I know this is probably not the best year to look at a new concept like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| but it has been revenue positive every year for the last 15 years and remains that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| So we would certainly like to maybe revisit this with you at a later date or now if that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| if anyone would like to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| But, again, it is a new program to bring in-house, but it has always been revenue positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| and generated funds that went right back into that golf course for improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| I'll be glad to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| Doug, there's been some discussion about merging with the city golf courses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Is this part of your proposal or is it just now for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| In my mind, it is a part of the long-term proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| You're probably aware the city has just redone their contracts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| They're on a basis now where they do have a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| but they can, within a one-year notice, terminate those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| So Sam Anderson and I have had those discussions about long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| We know it's nothing we can do quickly to look at combining where you could have some good efficiencies of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| some economies of scale, and provide a really good service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| and be able to share resources and people throughout the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| So this certainly bringing this in-house allows us to take a step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| It's obviously not all of them, but it's moving in that direction, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Is this part of your budget proposal now or is this in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| This is a part of the budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| If you'll see it there, it is proposed in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| It's not been recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| The golf operations were not recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| Doug, are we going to be able to afford a skate park in Powell this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| The ramps are out for a bid right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Also, we've had great success with the Wi-Fi park that actually doesn't cost the county a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| We've got a private vendor that's basically donated the Internet to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| Have there been any talks about possibly expanding that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| maybe seeing if we could get some other telephone companies to donate Wi-Fi service to our parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| We've not been approached by anybody, but certainly it's a good concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| We probably need to come up with a strategy to promote that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| It's worked great for us in Powell, and I think it's worked fairly well for Frontier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| because when someone's basically asking what they can expect from the home service that they offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| they'll say stop by the Powell Park and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| That's their stuff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| So I'm wondering if we might get some of the other telephone service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| to do something similar in our other parks, because it has been a great success out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| Appreciate the work you do and appreciate all the programs that you offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| Doug, on page 51 of the online budget, there's something called the Legacy Park Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| a contract for $50,000, with whom and for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| That is the Legacy Parks Foundation, and this is our, I guess, our second full year of funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| This is a proposal that was approved both by commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| Both entities contribute $100,000 to run that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| They have a separate board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| It's very similar to the Great Schools Foundation, other than quite a bit smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| The big question with that has always been the productivity of what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| and I think, if I'm not mistaken now, we are close to, in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| we're approaching a million dollars in donations of land and funds that have come through that foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| So a small investment on the front end for the seating county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| I think a great return on that investment throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| So, to me, that's a great program for a small amount of money that really is producing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| Probably the most recent, well, two really big activities you've probably heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| The Emirates property next to Iams Nature Center was donated through the foundation, over 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| They're also doing the fundraising in halls right now for the new park up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| and I think we're close to a half a million dollars of donations coming through for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| So without that body and that vehicle set up to do those fundraising efforts, they would not be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| Okay, now page 49, there's an item of $410,000, a contract with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| What contract is that and what are we getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Okay, which budget is that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Is that under park maintenance or admin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| It would be, let's see, page 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Yeah, again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I don't have the same page numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Let's see, the account number 9360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| Let's see, is that with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Contract with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| It doesn't specify the other, but it's up from past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| And I'm just wondering who that is and what are we getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| That's with administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| That is essentially running our sports program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| If you look at my administration staff, we have seven full-time people to run the entire park system sports program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| What we do is we run nearly all of our officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| and field directors through a contract services as opposed to having them as full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| Of course, we still have a whole other side of the house that is totally volunteer-driven in the coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| but that is our officials that officiate all the baseball, softball, basketball games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| as well as a good chunk of our gym directors that help those in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| Okay, a very similar item on page 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| We have the general park maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| We have a contract with others, and it's gone up from around 63,000 to around 70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Do you know what contract that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| That is contract mowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| We have about 40 employees in our park maintenance division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| and basically what we have done over the years is we've added parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| We've not added more full-time people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| We've got it split now to about 18 parks under contract mowing, and that's what that contract is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| The 40 full-time folks we have do park maintenance only in the sports-related parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| that need a little different level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Well, that gets me to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| With all those contracts and all that help, why do we need, on page 45, the 23,000 in overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| That is something we've moved just in the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| Perhaps a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| What we've done there is we work four 10-hour days for most of our maintenance folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| Just in last year, we moved a couple people as opposed to hiring more full-timers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| We actually found it saved us a little money to work a few folks overtime during the mowing season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| to do some of that mowing as opposed to contract certain parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| So we've got a couple folks that do some overtime work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| We also run some overtime at parks like Concord Park because we have such an enormous amount of special events there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| that we're in a situation where if we're offering a special event or supporting it, we'll also run overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| Now, in several of those events, we're actually charging a fee to reimburse us for that overtime as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| Yes, I have a question, and this may just be for the steps, maybe no new positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| but it was account number 9199, $134,827.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Is that under park maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| The 4810 account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Yeah, that's the Shumpert Park, the new positions for Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| We've got in total, when Shumpert Park is fully operational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| there will be five full-time positions to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| And then there was 9299.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| And that's benefits that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| 9229.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| What was the total for the benefits then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| $68,904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| For how many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| So five people are going to account for approximately $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:18| I think 225 is the total impact of the entire budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| and that would include the people, equipment, maintenance of equipment costs, fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| just about everything is the direct impact of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:41| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| I had similar questions with regard to the five new positions for Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| They're getting approximately $40,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| And what do their duties include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| Essentially, maintenance of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| We've got three multipurpose fields that will be used for baseball, soccer, perhaps rugby as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| We're hosting the central high school baseball field there, all the maintenance on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| for the high school program as well as our youth program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| We're going to add about three miles of walking trail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| There's a four-acre dog park, an 18-hole disc golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| and probably a BMX track, if not in the first phase, the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| And then with regard to the Legacy Park Fund, at some point are they going to become self-sustaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| that we will not have to support that, that obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| after a period of time they'll have name recognition and can support their own operating costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| That is the hope, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| And do you have a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Is there a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| We don't have an exact time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| You know, again, I think the return on investment there is a really good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| You know, and frankly, I think it would be nice if we could get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| and I think eventually we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| But I think when you see the return on investment for what we're putting into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| especially as compared to other programs that we deal with, it's really working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| So the $50,000 that we contribute and the $50,000 from the city, that's $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| And how many people do we employ or pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| There's essentially one person that works full-time for that foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| We've got one person in my office that supports that clerically on just a small percentage of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| But that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| So are we paying for their space costs as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| So $100,000 pays for their space, pays for their salary for that one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| And who is that one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| It's Carol Evans is the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| That was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Oh, that was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Doug, the 984 for the golf course, does that include Beverly and Concord?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Just three ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Just three ridges, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| And I've looked in detail at the budgets for the operating budgets there as well as what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| And, again, I think as Commissioner Hammond expressed, that eventually we could roll all those in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| We are, right now, the two Part III courses are separate non-profit entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| But we do also support those on maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| I've got about one full-time maintenance person at both those golf courses that support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| So, again, to me, long-term, it makes sense to pull that in-house probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| and have a much better streamlined operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| I want to say one thing about Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| Most of you all know that I've been active in youth baseball for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| We had a game at South Oil the other night out in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| And I learned from that visit out there that you all now have a Recreation Girls Fast Pitch Softball League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| And there are nine teams in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| And 100 young ladies are playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| And it's the first time that North County Rec has ever had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| And I think every grandma was there watching their kids play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| So that's been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| And that also was played at South Oil High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| That was a good idea on one of our staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Yeah, it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Take the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Mr. Todd Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| Todd Cook, Knox County Probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Unit number is 14210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:35| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Todd, do you still have a driving school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| We have, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Where does that revenue go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| I mean, who collects it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| It's collected by the court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| She left that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| Do you know how much is collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| It's different every month, just depending on how many the judges send to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| And I asked you last time about incident people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| Have you talked to any, like, to judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I mean, it seems like we're just letting somebody sign like a he-go-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| Well, basically, that's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| But we meet at least on a quarterly basis, the Justice Committee, to try to find deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| We've hired, I think, a couple of consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| They're looking at ways to improve the collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| I think if you'll look across the state, though, we're one of the highest in collections as it relates to other metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:46| You can't compare us to, like, Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| That's a different clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| But if you compare us to Nashville or Shelby County, we're head and shoulders above what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| What happens to the sheet you gave me last couple weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| A thousand people, I guess, are not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| You violated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| You're talking about the people that have warrants on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| We file the warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| They're in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| You used to be a warrants officer that the sheriff's office goes out and tries to locate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| We assist in some of those matters now to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| That number used to be almost double what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| So you didn't have nobody showing up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Well, before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| You only had 2,500 people on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| That number fluctuates every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| We may have as many as 5,000 on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| You know, if you ask the sheriff, he'll tell you that his workload increases when it gets warm outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| Well, we don't see those cases until they go through the court system, until there's a disposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| So our peak time may be around Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Right now it's really our slow time, if there is such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Like in 2002, the budget was like $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| And today it's over a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| What has changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| Well, if you'll remember, it was either 2003 or 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| they transferred the community service department from the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| on an agreement between the former sheriff and the current administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| We transferred that whole entire department because it was a better fit for it to be in the probation office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| than in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| I don't exactly remember how many dollars we're talking about, but that was a huge increase there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Wasn't it only two employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Well, you're talking about two employees and they're operating a budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| One of those employees made over $60,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| I don't see any other lights, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| You hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| I've been waiting on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| Good afternoon, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Hugh Holt, Purchasing Division, Unit Number 6010 for Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:36| You don't have any opening remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| I'm ready to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| I had my light on from last time, but I can't let this pass by, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| You're okay with your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| It's got everything you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| It's got everything that I need to deliver the services that we anticipate delivering in the next physical year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| So you think you'll be able to spot if someone uses a purchase card at a place it shouldn't be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| That service in July will be for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| And what would change from last July to this July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| We just went through a new bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| and we're fixing to award to a contractor who offers that service for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:37| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| I'd like to know who offered that service for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| The award has not been made yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| And until that, I would be happy to discuss it with you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| But there's several other competitors that have not been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| But I'd be happy to share that with you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| So they've not been notified of being awarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| And yet somebody awarded it and did it for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| We're in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| In fact, several companies do offer that service for free now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| If several offered for free, how did you determine which one to choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| Well, there are numerous things that went on during that evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| in regard to the criteria and the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| But, again, it's still a closed process until the award is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| and I'd be happy to discuss it with you after the meeting or any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| You and I had met with Dick Sturkey with Comcast Spotlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| and the mayor decided not to use your proposal for advertising the auction at South High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6712)|
| 1:52:01| through Comcast Spotlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| But it was determined or decided that you would use Comcast Spotlight in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| especially when it dealt with what facility that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| It was a multimillion-dollar facility that you're considering using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| We're looking at the disposition of some other real property here at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:26| and I would feel more comfortable if Mr. Troyer would speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| But there are three facilities that I'm aware of that may potentially be disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| John, which three facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| We're in negotiation with a couple of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| and we are working together on another proposal for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| And we'd like to get a little further on our homework before we present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| But we don't expect there's going to be much delay at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| but we have had more than one suggestion at looking at county properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| and seeing what we can sell and put back on the tax roll, and I think that's a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| And I plan to pursue that, and plan to pursue that vigorously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Where does this appear, then, in the budget for using Comcast Spotlight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| Would that be underneath communications or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Contracts with others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| That would be located in the contracts with other agencies or professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| Let me check it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| There are two different budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Also in 60-20 property management, that's where the disposition of property takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| And there also will be some advertising expenses that are covered under the 60-10 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:08| Now, when you're referring, are you talking about account 60-20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Yeah, that's for property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| I'll pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Now, I thought that you said that when you're getting rid of properties that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| I thought what you had told me was that the buyer actually that's offset with the buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| When there's an auction, there's a buyer's premium that covers the majority of the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| So did you include Comcast Spotlight in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| This budget was submitted prior to any meetings with Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| But after speaking with Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| and we feel like that it would be a viable option later on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| and we could take something like that out of the proceeds of a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| But we may have enough in our line item to cover something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| if you're not talking more than a couple of thousand dollars in an expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| Okay, so the contract that you hold with Comcast Spotlight, is it a viable contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| Is it one that you anticipate to use in the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| It's executed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Yes, I just have a question with regard to space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Your space costs for the purchasing department is $23,433,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| and then you have space costs for property management of $51,788.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:50| Now the space costs for purchasing is obviously your PBA contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Now for property management, what does that $51,000 go for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| That's a totally separate facility that's located behind the Knox County Central Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| That's a 10,000 square foot warehouse where all the county's personal property is disposed or reutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:14| But who do we send that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| So that's the PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| PBA also, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Manages that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| And it's just a storage facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| There's about 1,700 square feet of it is office space, and the other is storage and liquidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| Hugh, getting back to the person that I guess the company is going to be over the P card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:45| are they familiar with the regulations of Knox County Government and the procedures of the purchasing card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| Very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| And if someone gets by with something, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| They'll reimburse us for that charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| What we have is there is a safeguard that, just like with your credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:09| if there's fraudulent activity on the card, we report it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| And we can do this through daily monitoring of the card system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| But, yeah, we have basically a 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Actually, it's 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| It used to be 60 days that we can contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Because I know some credit cards, if you get charged, the company would cover it if it was fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| If it's fraud, we're covered up to as long as we report within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| So if someone charges something, is that fraud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| If they charge something that's inappropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| If it's not in the line of county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| What's the trans-employee BIN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| Is that in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| I'm not sure, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| 92, 93 in the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| Transfer of employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| Yeah, there's one employee from the finance department who's transferred to the minority supplier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| or the supplier diversity program, and that's the benefits related to that one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| So finance is minus a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Purchasing is plus a person, and that's the benefits related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| And the auto allowance, is that real auto allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Yeah, that's for Mr. Minner, the supplier diversity coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| He's the only one in the office that has anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| And then you've got down here, it's a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| Utilities and fuel under vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| We have one vehicle for purchasing that's used for miscellaneous activities for 11 staffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| I was wanting to know, when you contracted out for this P-card oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| are they not only going to look at the P-cards within the Knox County system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| but will they also extend oversight over any other, was it the school system or any other division?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| The school system is already participating in this process, and the community action committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:19| almost every division of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| Now, I also had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| Did the school system take up their P-cards, or do they still have theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:36| No, ma'am, they still have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Hugh, with the retraction of a lot of the P-cards that were being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| you'd stated once before when you'd spoken to the commission that that was a huge time saver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| It saved money and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| With those going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| are you expecting any increased cost in your budget to handle the fact that you're going to be doing quotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| and paper purchasing as opposed to P-card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| Well, the rank and file employee, they have the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| They're back in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| They're using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| I don't anticipate a tremendous increase in paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:32| As I said, it's the people, the rank and file, the field people have the cards, and they're using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| So to answer your question, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:44| Can I ask one more question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| So how many P-cards do we have issued out and are in use now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| Right now, I am not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of about 120, 125 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| But I thought that that had decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| I thought that it had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| In the mayor's administration, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| No one else turned over any P-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| So in the mayor's administration, how many P-cards are there currently in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| I'd hate to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| I can make a quick phone call and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| It won't take me five minutes to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| How many did they start out with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| Almost about 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| In the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| I believe that's how many there were, and it was reduced to somewhere around 50, 3, 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| There's that many people in the mayor's administration that need a P-card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| John, how many employees do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| The mayor has about 1,000 people that report to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| And that includes our P-cards that are set up just for contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| And so we have some P-cards that are only for a specific contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| like the health department has some to buy pharmaceuticals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Yeah, the majority of the cards are assigned to a specific agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| just like a U.S. food for the jail system or U.S. auto parts for the service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| So we've diminished the number of cards that we're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| but we've added a person to staff that, to oversee it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| I don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| You're talking about a person who has shared duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| You're talking about a contracts coordinator and a P-card administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| That person has dual duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| So as a contract coordinator, are they going to be overseeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| and make sure contracts are in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Yes, they are assisting the contracts administrator in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| We manage approximately 500 term agreements a year with six professional buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| Thank you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| Our last one is the mayor's office, Dwight, John, and Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Strickland Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| If I might, before I start, I'd like to clarify something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| because I think there is some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| If you define the mayor's office narrowly as suite 615 and the staff within suite 615,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:39| there is one P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| That P-card is assigned to April Clifton, who is our office administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| and it is used exclusively for the purchase of office supplies for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| If you define the executive branch more broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| then you encompass parks and recreation, engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| air quality control, and other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| That is where the P-cards are in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| But speaking specifically to the mayor's office, suite 615,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| we have one assigned to April Clifton and exclusively for office supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| I would venture to say if you showed up and tried to give them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| people are going to lock the doors and not let you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| Our expenses are under series 1003310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:33| I'll give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| I think specific questions may be more usefully directed to Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| but if I have any sense of things, I'll certainly be glad to attempt to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:48| We felt like it was important to make a good, strong statement in terms of austerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| given the budget situation that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| So we have uniformly been trying to cut expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| The mayor's grants and donations account has been cut from $50,000 to $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| Supplies and materials has been cut from $34,500 to $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| Our travel budget has been cut from $40,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| Food budget has been cut from $15,000 to $7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| Our overall budget for the mayor's office is down from the approved budget of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| and we hope that we're setting a good example as we ask other people to tighten their belts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:30| Also, I want to say thanks to Commissioner Roundtree for his comments about Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| and Recreation and particularly the softball league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| They do some good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| In addition to the Women's Softball Recreation League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| we also have a senior softball league that's been very active and very successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| I'm not old enough to play in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| I wasn't suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| As our chairman is taking a seat, Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| I know we're interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| I had a question, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| You have contract with other, and last year's actual was $31,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| and this year you're requesting $90,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Can you explain that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| I'd have to defer to Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| $9360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7585)|
| 2:06:39| A couple of things that are in there include the county's lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:47| and there's a couple of different contracts there that are in there, and that's not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| We're working on getting some more detail for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| So then what is legislative delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| Patsy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| There is a local representative for the legislative delegation, Patsy Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| who has been in place for many years, and those expenses are codified under that line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| She provides local Knox County support to the Knox County legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| So would she not be considered our lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| She's a support employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| She does constituent service, clerical work, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| She's the locally based staff support person for Knox County's legislative delegation for Representative Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:43| Tyndall, Dunn, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| Now, with regard to the Read With Me program that has been zeroed out, has that been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7672)|
| 2:08:03| It's our expectation that the Read With Me would be privately raised monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| And then with regard to the, it's called the Mayor's Education Summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| but I understand it's the Great Schools Partnership is really what it is, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| There's two different pieces to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| The mayor does put on an education summit, and that's an event, and then the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:32| Program, what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| And then the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| So are both of those programs included under this one header?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Great Schools is by itself $3.8 million, and then the Education Summit is just only that, the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| And those are the event expenses, local dollars, and what is above that is expected to be privately raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| Because the Mayor's Education Summit, you're requesting $3.8 for that this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| That's the Great Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| So where is the first day of school event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Where is that and the expense for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| I don't know if that's going to be reflected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| I don't have a big budget detail in front of me, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| but first day fest revenues are privately raised and receded to the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:23| So there's no actual expenditure of public funds, and it may not be reflected in the budget detail that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| If it is, it's strictly flow-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Is the $3.8, is that the only money that the Great Schools is going to receive from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| Because in the news sentinel this past Sunday, the editorial, it was remarked that it was $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| $3.8 represents General County's donation or contribution toward the Great Schools effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:58| The state is budgeted to receive or to give $1.7 million for the pre-K program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:06| and that part is being reflected through the school board's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| And the Great Schools also has its own fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| and its own grants that are not reflected in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| And we're happy to submit to you the proposed Great Schools budget, because ours is just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| What you see here, the $3.8 is just our contribution toward that, and there's many activities besides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| But as I understood the Great Schools partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| it was supposed to be kind of a self-sustaining that the first year or so was to help get it going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| and then it was supposed to, through private donations and grants, support itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| It was not supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| It was not designed to be supported by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| The county supports it through, I guess, encouraging and providing some funding to help to be a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| and help to get innovative programs off the ground and give them a testing ground, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| because they may try a program and decide that's not what we want to do system-wide and stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| No, I understand the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| What I'm saying is that the funding of it was supposed to come from grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| That's why they have a grant writer, and they were supposed to use private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| And as I see it, and when we were presented with the budget at the school board, was it Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| Last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| The lion's share of donations or dollars are all Knox County dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| There's maybe a very small percentage that are private and or grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| I think you raise a very good point, a very valid point, and I think it needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Any grants going away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| Dwight, starting at 3310, full-time pay, $710,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7914)|
| 2:12:04| Who does that cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| Because I know there's many people in the mayor's office, but, you know, finance department, Mr. Troyer's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| but I'm sure he falls under finance and office on neighborhood, probably falls under office on neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| So who are the people on this pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| I don't have the budget detail in front of me, Commissioner, so I'll defer to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| It should be in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| We'll provide a separate list of all the positions that are included in this $710,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| The part-time seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7955)|
| 2:12:44| $20,080.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| Yeah, that's the interns, and you'll notice that there's also an item in there that's a minus $13,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| so it's really $20,000 minus the $13,000 to net out about $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| Well, that's the same amount as Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Is that where Ben was transferred his pay out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| No, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| This is interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| Well, you've got part-time seasonal, but then you've got new positions, minus $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| Yeah, that's an offset to the part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| So it's $20,000 to the positive, $13,000 to the negative, and that is $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| What's the miscellaneous expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| That's been a topic of much discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| That's the mayor's expense allowance, and it's the same as it's proposed, it's the same as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| What is the mayor's salary this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| After whatever he gets, I mean, what's his pay after a raise this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8017)|
| 2:13:48| We'll be glad to report that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| Do you not have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| It's based on, you know, I think the charter says that he's supposed to be the highest paid person in the county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| and it's that plus $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| And what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| We'll be glad to provide that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| I don't have that right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| Well, if you look at all these, they're in the 100s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| and it has been your position during the year without commission approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| that you can move this 100 item around anywhere you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| So, you know, there's close to $800,000 in 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:34| I just want to be perfectly clear this year is what we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| because down here you also have auto allowance of $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| $3,000 should not be there, and we intend to make a correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| That is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| It shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| What's other professionals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:14| We'll be glad to show just everything that's charged out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:32| You know, as you can see, the line item last year was $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| Did you not do the budget, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Are you in charge of this budget, and now we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| I thought Dwight was going to speak to it today, so I just didn't prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| What about vehicle, $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| Yeah, repair and maintenance to county vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| And so if they need new tires, if they need brakes, if they need, you know, an alternator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:58| How many vehicles do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Yeah, there's three in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| Who do they belong to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| They belong to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| but they're driven by the mayor and Mike Arms and Mr. VandeVeik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| If you go down to communications and IT, I guess IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| Yeah, IT charges each department based on how many computers they have for maintenance of those computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| And so that's information technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| What about other related services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:56| Yeah, again, I didn't come prepared to talk about the mayor's budget today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| but we're happy to give you a full summary of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| But I think it's important to note that, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| Francis has just given me the proposed salary for the mayor is $148,525,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:16| and that would be a dollar more than the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| What is that, $148?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| $148,525, and that's a dollar more than the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| Plus his $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| As an expense allowance, that's what's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| The contract with other, I know Commissioner Davis had asked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8256)|
| 2:17:44| Would that be someplace that Joe May, the county lobbyist, would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| That's one of the contracts, Joe May and Pratt & Whitney, and there's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| Who's Joe May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| He's the county lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| What's his salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| He's not a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| What's his contractual agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| I don't have his contract right in front of me, so I couldn't tell you what his contract is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| Again, I wasn't prepared to talk about the mayor's budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| I have no questions since we can't seem to get no answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| We'll be glad to give you a written summary of everything that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| I certainly think that the mayor's office, you'll see, is down from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:31| We'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| Yes, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| How much did you say the travel allowance had been cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| From $40,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| What's that $20,000 to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| I think it's primarily supporting the mayor's trips to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| This is our travel line item, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| It's not a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| It's the travel line item in the budget used to support the operations of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| My understanding was last July that the mayor and everybody up there were supposed to go on per diem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| just like everybody else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| Yes, sir, but that still has to be charged somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| Those expenses still have to be charged to a specific time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| I understand it has to be charged somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| but if he goes in there and gets receipts, is he going to come back and want the money reimbursed for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| or is it going to come out of this $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| It would come out of this $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| It would be charged to this particular line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| Well, why do you have to have that $20,000 if he's on per diem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| Again, Commissioner, I think I'm not doing a very good job explaining this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| If he is on per diem or I am on per diem and we travel to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| and I go to the service center and I put gas in my county car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| that gas, even though there's not a transaction, is charged to the batteries and fuel account in the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| If the mayor travels to Nashville and he spends two days there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| and he collects the standard per diem for those two days and he comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| and that per diem is paid to the mayor, that expense is charged against this item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| How do the other county employees work that if they go to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| and they have to put gas in a county car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| I would assume they do it exactly the same where they use a pilot car for those that have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:24| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| John, we talked about this the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| The sheriff's pension, the people voted for it and we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:44| We estimated just sort of top of our head as what, about a ten cent impact on the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:51| When you take a look at the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| Yeah, it was on the ballot for approximately eight cents, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| But, you know, when we were estimating the eight cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| we thought we were going to amortize about $57 million over a 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8463)|
| 2:21:12| We ended up getting a bond and bonds are for 20-year periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| So it would be like paying off a house note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| Instead of paying it off on a 30-year, we're paying it off over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| which requires a little higher payment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| Out of that ten cents that we're talking about, how much of that is going towards the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:43| I think the payment was like $3.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| So how does that calculate back into cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| 3.8 divided by 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Maybe a nickel, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| About a nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| So the other expense being the cost going forward because it's more expensive than what we were doing prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:07| When the employee was putting in six percent, the county was matching six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| Now the employee is putting in their six percent and the county is having to put, you said ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| Ten and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Ten and a half percent, which is actually less than what we originally estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| because we were estimating it to be closer to 11.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| It's ten and a half plus the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| So combined, you've got the debt service, which is the bond issue, plus the additional cost going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| And that total is about, so we're saying that's close to $8 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| A little shy of $7 million and payments go up as we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| And if you take a look at this actuarially, you take a look at what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| our actuary liability out there for future and how much money we actually have in, say, our account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8577)|
| 2:23:09| we have in hand, how does that compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| Yeah, we just got, I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| We just got an actuarial report for the pension board, and that is their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| is to put a value on how much is the promise that was made, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| And some people talk about they're worried about the debt of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| The value of the promise that was made for the pension plan is over $131 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:37| That's present value, today's dollars, $131 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| So our debt in present dollars is $131 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| And how much do we actually have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| Now, the county only borrowed $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| Now, our debt, if you want to talk about just debt, our debt is the promise that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| and the promise that was made was a $131 million promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Now, what was borrowed was only $57 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| and so what happened is the uniformed officers contributed $30 million of their pension money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:08| What they had in their plans they turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| And the county borrowed $57 million to go ahead and fix the payments on just what that piece was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8651)|
| 2:24:20| It's $57 million, but the debt really was $131 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| And then the county continues to contribute 10.5% of payroll from here on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| and that's our number, is our actuarial number that's recommended for this budget for this year, 10.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| How much money do we have on hand to cover our debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| The pension debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| It's about $93 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| So we're actually short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| I mean, if you want to think about how much we have versus how much our current value of our liability, we're short by over $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8689)|
| 2:24:58| And that's why we have to contribute 10.5% each year for as long as we have the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| Yeah, that's a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Well, you know, the people approved a liability that they knew was going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:17| at least at the time they thought was going to cost them $0.08 on the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| whether it's through cuts or through a property tax rate increase, but they knew there was going to be an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8723)|
| 2:25:30| And so we've got about a $0.05 impact on our debt side, and I guess a $0.05 impact on our operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:42| Is that a good way to classify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| So the pension plan is costing us, I mean, if we wanted to, I mean, if you want to take a look at it one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8746)|
| 2:25:56| you're taking away $0.05 from either the sheriff's operational side if you wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| or $0.05 off of schools, or $0.05 towards paving roads, or anywhere else, or dividing it up any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8761)|
| 2:26:16| I mean, that's what the people voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| And that's the value of the promise was $131 million, and that's just what the county is obligated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:35| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| Yes, I had a question again about the miscellaneous expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| Can you explain, Mr. Vandervee, what that exactly is for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner, that's the $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| And we've had this discussion a number of times, some predating your tenure on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| But going back to Mr. Shumpert's, or excuse me, Mr. Kessel's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| through Mr. Kessel's administration, Mr. Shumpert's administration, and now Mayor Axel's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| all county executives or mayors have had an account labeled various things over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| But it is for expenses of the office for which they would either claim reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| or they would simply draw that money as salary, pay taxes on it, and then use it for expenses of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| What kind of expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Can you please give me examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| It could be anything from flowers for funerals to professional gifts to meals and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:42| I think, to the best of my knowledge, it's unrestricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:52| I guess my question is, isn't that kind of what grants donations is for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| Isn't that $40,000 set aside for the mayor to do kind of those sorts of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| Because if you're buying flowers for someone, that's not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| Let me just give you a couple of examples that were in the 40 in this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| I know that it was $12,000 from Beaumont Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| I know there's a certain amount of money to sponsor the ice skating downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| These are just different events and different charities that benefit the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| I know there was an event that the mayor helped to sponsor with the Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| That's where the $40,000 went, and we'll be glad to get a printout of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| If this helps any, Commissioner Lambert is doing a Ride for the Cure, and he's soliciting sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:50| That's the sort of expenditure that would come out of that $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| If he solicits a $250 contribution to the American Cancer Society for support of his event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8934)|
| 2:29:02| that might be the kind of contribution that would come out of that $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| On the other hand, if Commissioner Moore wants $5,000 for the Halls Fieldhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| that's the kind of expense that would come out of the 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| Okay. Well, if we're going to use this $20,000 as an expense account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| I would like to see that receipts are turned in and that reimbursements are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| that it's not just placed into someone's salary, into their check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| and we have no idea of knowing whether it was actually used for legitimate expenses or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:41| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| Yes, there's been a lot of requests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| Let me make sure, Chairman, that these requests are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| We're keeping notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| I also wanted to know when can we expect a chart diagram of the structural organization of the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=8995)|
| 2:30:07| Our plan is either July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| You know, there's several of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| I'm one who's new that would probably benefit from seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| Do you have an old one that we could look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| Yeah, we're happy to provide that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| Mr. Vanderbilt, just kind of to be clear going forward so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| I know there's been a lot of misunderstandings, maybe some on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| maybe some on your part as it relates to whether there's $20,000 in the salary supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| or whether it's for expenses or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| But two things, and Commissioner Pinkston touched on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| and I just want it clear in my mind and hopefully in yours as well, the food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| You've cut it by a factor of two, $7,500 in the food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| What can be claimed against that budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| What can you do with that budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| If the governor comes in town, can you take the governor to Chesapeake from that budget, in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:19| Could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| Would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Well, could you is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| In your mind, does that budget line item allow you to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:35| We follow the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| And the procurement code would allow for such an expense if the governor came to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| and expenses were incurred for feeding the governor at Chesapeake's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| Would we regard it as a legitimate expenditure to claim that against this $7,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| Yes, sir, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| I think in the present climate going forward, I cannot anticipate that anybody would actually do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| But would we regard it as compliant with the purchasing code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| Absolutely, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| See, and I actually think that's a shame because I'm in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| That should come out of a fund like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| Maybe not everyone agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| Okay, but strictly speaking, this line item can be used for prepared meals for county government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:25| I think Mr. Owing summed it up very well during the special called meeting when he said food is food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9145)|
| 2:32:33| Hopefully we can get beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| And then on travel, I guess a similar thing, and you kind of touched on it when you answered Mr. Pinkston's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:45| But you also said a person, John Troyer, can go to Nashville for official county government business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9165)|
| 2:32:54| and if he has a pilot card, he can use that pilot card in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9174)|
| 2:33:01| I think you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| You said he can either use the pilot card or use his own money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| and claim the 50-whatever-percent or 48-percent per mile fee if he drives his own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9186)|
| 2:33:14| Let me just address that one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| If the person is driving a county car, then they are allowed to use a pilot card if they have one available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| or they can get reimbursed and they submit a receipt and get reimbursed on an expense report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:28| and that's how it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| If a person drives their own vehicle, then they would claim cents per mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| They'll just get the cents per mile, and you all set the standard rate, or you all use the U.S. government standard rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| We use the IRS rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| IRS rates, and the distances are used from a central place as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| So, and then that money comes out of that travel fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| Right, as well as hotel expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| Okay, now, in terms of a hotel expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| if you're going to use your own personal, you don't have a P-card anymore, so you use your own hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9237)|
| 2:34:04| are you still to turn in a receipt because there's a standard government rate for $89 for Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:12| $129 for Atlanta, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| Are you all just paying that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| So when you say per diem, I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| Are you all just paying, if it's $50 a day plus a $120 room fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| are you all just paying $170 a day, forget about receipts, or are we still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| Yeah, those room rates that you mentioned are maximum rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| and so they would submit the receipt, and as long as it was within the maximum, it would be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| Standard way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Yes, Dwight, you got involved in the Tommy Shumpert deal and Dwight Kessel deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9285)|
| 2:34:51| the $12,000, this mayor gets $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| I'd like for Mr. McKenzie to know that they turn receipts in, and they drew on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9294)|
| 2:35:00| It didn't go in their own checking account, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| If they went down and fed the governor, they turned a receipt in for it and got reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| Now, on this food budget, how much is it this year, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| $7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| $7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| Well, now let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| In 2006, we approved a food budget of $5,000, but you spent $51,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9317)|
| 2:35:26| In 2007, we raised it to $15,000, and you spent $46,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| So what difference, if we have no control over it, why is it even in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9331)|
| 2:35:39| Commissioner, you've seen the past budget reconciliations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| so I'm not sure how to speak to the prior fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| But I can assure you with some confidence that if it's budgeted at $7,500 this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| it will not be more than $7,500 in expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| It will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Well, you know, it's been about, in two years, it's $77,000 over the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Now, on this $20,000 travel allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| is the mayor going to be able to take that and deposit it in his checking account like he's been doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| To the best of my knowledge, he's not going to make any change in how that's handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| As Mr. Troyer has stated in some of the previous discussions we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| there is a reportable and then a non-reportable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| Yeah, it's accountable and non-accountable as defined by the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| Well, I'm going to be against that, I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| And this is for you, Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| What is our change in the net assets of the county from last year to this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| County what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| You're talking about the current year, 07-08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| Of course, we won't know that until we close up the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| What was it from 06-07 to 07-08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| What was the net change in our assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| I'd have to go back and look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| You're talking about just the general funded accounting overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9421)|
