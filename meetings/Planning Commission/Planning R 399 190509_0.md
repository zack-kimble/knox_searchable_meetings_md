| 0:01:04| We receive no salary and volunteer our time as a service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| I hope all of you picked up an agenda handout in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| In addition to the agenda, this handout includes information about the city-county building and how today's meeting will be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| Many of the items we vote on require further action by city council or county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| and in the handout is the meeting schedule for these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=97)|
| 0:01:44| Applicants will be notified of the meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=104)|

| 0:01:52| I would also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=112)|

| 0:02:19| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| I will then ask for other comments from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| The opposition will also be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| and avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| All speakers should come to the podium, speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=195)|

| 0:12:22| Is there anyone that would like anything removed from the consent list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, I would. Item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Okay. Item 25 is removed from consent and will be heard at its normally scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| Motion to hear consent as read with the exception of item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| We have a motion and a second by Commissioner Clancy to hear the consent items as read with the exception of 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=775)|

| 0:13:24| Madam Chair, I think there's some people in the audience who were here for item number 30 and may not be aware that that has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=804)|
| 0:13:35| The Duke development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| I see a lot of smiles on faces out there, so I think that they're probably aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| But they're not even going to discuss it, though, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| We are not going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| But my understanding is that they're here to see how typical planning commission meetings work and to educate themselves in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=828)|
| 0:13:58| And thank you for your attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| We are moving on to item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=845)|
| 0:14:21| This is a subdivision report concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| The subdivision is Highland Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| The applicant developer is Terry Romans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| The location is the north side of Highland View Drive, northeast of Pickens Gap Road, west of Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| Approximate acreage is 124 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| The zoning is currently planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Existing land use is vacant land, and the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| Number of lots is 165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Subdivision variance is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| There looks to be nine variances and one waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| We'll be having two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| The staff recommendation on vote one will be to approve variances one through nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| because the site's existing access and topography restricts compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And the second vote will be to approve the concept plan subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| Oh, since we have no applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| I'm sorry, I did not see your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Sir, would you like to go first or hear from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Okay, folks, do you have a spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=955)|
| 0:16:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| My name is Paul Cacase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| I live at 415 Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| It's the first house right at the entrance of the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| First of all, I'd like to ask that you please review the first variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| asking to reduce the turning radius from 25 degrees to zero degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I believe that creates an issue turning onto Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| There's only eight and a half feet driving width on the closest lane to the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| Turning onto that lane presents a problem when there's oncoming traffic on the oncoming lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| You most of the time have to wait for traffic to go by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| especially if you have a large vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| It presents an issue turning into the oncoming lane sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| I'd like to say that, first of all, I believe that the traffic study is not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| as far as how many cars are on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| It was done on November 29th, which is the week following Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I've lived on that road for 24 years, and that's always a light week of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| people on vacation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| So please review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| My house and my neighbor's house across the road are bordering the property line on each side of the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| Our master bedroom is on the side of the road that enters traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| and we're concerned about the amount of traffic noise that would be created from the in and out vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| The entrance is also directly in front of two homes across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| which would also be affected by the amount of traffic going in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| as well as headlight noise going through their homes early in the morning and the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| which would be a distraction for their 20 years plus of residency in that home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| The traffic study indicates that there's approximately 1,649 trips estimated per week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| I'm sorry, per day added to the existing traffic that's already on that road, which is quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| It does not take into account the traffic that's on Chapman Highway entering Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| There's one light at Hendron's Chapel going south, which is the last light exiting Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| which is one mile from that light to Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| There's approximately one mile from Highland View Drive to Seymour, which is the next light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| so you have a flow of traffic two miles in width, which presents an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| The traffic study states there's approximately 122 trips in the a.m. peak hour, 7 to 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| and 165 trips in the p.m. hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| How many cars are going to be backed up at the corner of Chapman and Highland View Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| How many more issues is that going to create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| It states that there's 55 students that will be added to the local school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Where is the bus going to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| They can't stop on Highland View Drive for 55 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Where are those children going to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| If they go into Highland View subdivision, where is the bus going to exit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| There's only one entrance and exit for that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| There is a line of sight issue coming out of the subdivision to the left going towards Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| There's a little ridge coming over the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| You can't see traffic coming that way, and we often get cars doing 60, 70 miles per hour on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| So if they're not careful and they can't see that traffic coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| There's also a hindrance to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| There's a utility pole with a big white box on it that presents a distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| Most of the time when I'm pulling out of my driveway, I have to either sit behind it or ahead of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| to try to see the traffic, which presents a distraction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1199)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. Romans, would you care to give us your site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| Terry Romans, 1923 Hopewell Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| We had a licensed engineer do the traffic study, so I'm trusting that what he did is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| I went out myself personally, shot the sight distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| One of the neighbors has some trees on our property that he'll have to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| so that it will make adequate sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| One other issue, if I can add, maybe, if this gets approved, which we want it to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| after having discussion with Knox County Engineering about removing the sidewalk requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1268)|
| 0:21:18| That would be something that you would be requesting of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| because it is one of the conditions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| That would be something that you would need to ask the Planning Commission to remove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| not Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Right, I'm asking the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| But I've been talking with them, and they support removing the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| So that's something that you would like that particular condition removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| is what you're requesting, condition number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| You'll still have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| We will be discussing amongst the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Mr. Breschko, I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| At what point in a subdivision is more than one entrance required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| or is that in the subdivision regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| It's not, but it's been kind of a practice that we've recommended if there's 150 lots or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| that they look at a second entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| This property only has one access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| so they would not be able to provide another access into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| I mean, this is the third time that this has been before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| It had originally been approved, I think it was back in 2007, for 119 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| and at that time it was based on septic systems being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| They were told basically they needed to get sewer extension for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| They did a rezoning amendment that they increased the density to the 1.47 DUs per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| and they got an approval for 169 lots back in December of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| A good part of the site had been graded for that additional road layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and the property owner is requesting an approval of a revised plan for 165 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| So this isn't the first time this has come in with this proposed access at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| They've actually looked at clustering the lots on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and the, I guess, a little more flatter portions of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| and the area that actually had more lots, that's the steeper portion in the north side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| they've revised the plan that those are from a five and a half acre lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| to a 22 acre lot for the steeper areas on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| And to respond on that one variance issue that was raised at the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| there's a requirement at intersection that there's a right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| an edge-of-pavement radius that's required, a 25-foot radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| In this case, the proposed road will meet that radius requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| which allows for the turning of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| The right-of-way will not meet it because they do not have control of the adjoining two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| to put a 25-foot radius that would extend onto the adjoining property to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So that's why they've asked for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| But the road design will meet the 25-foot radius requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| And with regards to the traffic study that was done on November 29th, do those just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1469)|
| 0:24:39| I mean, they had a traffic engineer submit a traffic study to us for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| It was reviewed by our staff and by Knox County staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| and we were in agreement with the recommendations that they were making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| There was the issue raised about site distance, and it's vegetation that creates the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| and the applicant is responding to that issue about the maintenance of the vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| Okay. And one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Is this within the parental responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Yes, I was wondering about this approved waiver by Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| reduction of the pavement width down to a minimum of 22 feet when sidewalks are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| Why would you deviate from 26 feet down to 22 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| The 22 feet is already allowed for joint permanent easements no matter how many lots they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| So we're actually, we support removing the sidewalks and having 26 feet of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| That was the recommendation that our department sent over to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| So why when all the other subdivisions have sidewalks on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1556)|
| 0:26:08| does this one not have sidewalks on one side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| The reason Planning staff recommended that was that the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| are the standards they provide an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| We've been very liberal to the development community with what an amenity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| We consider sidewalks an amenity, the ability to walk within your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| With 165 lots, the traffic engineers say each lot results in 10 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| So you're looking at the entrance, 1,600 vehicles per day passing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| There's a 26-foot sidewalk or 26-foot roadway width with that much traffic able to accommodate both vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1608)|
| 0:26:57| safely accommodate vehicles and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| That's the question that you have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| The planning staff felt that and had worked with engineering that if a sidewalk is provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| a 22-foot roadway width reduces the cost, both environmental and financial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| by providing that sidewalk and a roadway to accommodate all modes of transportation safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| And that was the reason for our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| The engineering department, I think, felt that this area would never be in a place where people walked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| But you're recommending going to a 50-foot right-of-way and 26-foot of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| That's what the, as I understand, that's what the applicant has requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| what the engineering department has said they would accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| That's not what we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| That's not what staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| That's where you received this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| The applicant requested the removal of the sidewalk five minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Mr. Reynolds, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| Sorry, I did not mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| I must have pressed it with my chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Roman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| You confused me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| You said that you checked sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| And one of your neighbors has a tree on your property that he has to take down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and then you'll get sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| I'm not sure how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| It's a shrub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| How does he have one on your property that he has to take down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| It's on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| And we're talking about maybe five or six foot of his shrub line is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Because based on the sight distance that I shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| you've got to come back off the edge of the pavement a certain distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| At a three-and-a-half-foot eye height, which is pretty small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| then those shrubs are about four-foot tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| So just taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| But they're on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Taken out, removing those shrubs, that opens up that sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| He may not have planted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| They may have been planted there prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Well, if they're on your property, I would say you're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And then that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I'm still confused about how we can approve the waiver on the 22-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| where sidewalks are provided, but they want to take number nine out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| If I can comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| When staff prepared the report from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| we had been recommending sidewalks on the subdivision because, as Gerald had pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| because of the PR zoning and the number of lots within the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| they have a common area shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| So we had recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| The subdivision regulations allow either Knox County or the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| within the jurisdiction to reduce the pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| There's not a set minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| And in this case, in discussing it with Knox County staff concerning the sidewalk being provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| in fact, I think initially they may have had 24 foot as the width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| and it was recommended that consideration would be allowed down to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Knox County has changed their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| If they're saying they don't want sidewalks and that they would prefer to see a 26-foot pavement width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| that's their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| The waiver is based on their recommendation for a reduction of pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| So it appears that they've changed that position since I did the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| So if we wanted to approve this with sidewalks in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| they would be doing a 22-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| Pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Pavement, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Yeah, because it's, you know, if recommended by Knox County on the pavement reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| if they said they don't want to support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I guess it would be sidewalks with 26-foot pavement width that they didn't want to reduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| If you wanted to require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Because it's their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| It's based on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| It appears what they're saying is that if there are sidewalks, there would be a 22-foot pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| If there are no sidewalks, there are 26-foot pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Not mixing and matching, but 22 and sidewalk, 26 and no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one through none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| because the site's existing access and topography restrict compliance with subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| We still have lights on, but there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Did I hear somebody second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| We're not going to take a vote at this time because we still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| The opposition still has some time, and there's a gentleman back at the back of the room that would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| And, sir, if you would come up to the podium, state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1959)|
| 0:32:53| My name is Michael Hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I live at 409 Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| The house that you see in the picture is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| My property adjoins this project on two sides, the rear and the side where the right-of-way is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| Just to address the hedge issue, this is the first I've heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| So this is news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| I have lived in this dwelling for over 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| I purchased it from the original owners who built the house in 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| This hedge has been in place for over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| So I don't know why it was put that way to begin with, but it has been in place all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| I wasn't planning to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I'm a little bit nervous, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| So, in other words, but the hedge is not on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Apparently, the end of it, the very end of it may be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| It's not exactly straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| It crosses over the line, so the very end is probably on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| But this is the first I've heard of needing to remove it for a line-of-sight issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| So it would have been nice if someone could have approached me beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| It's just a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Yeah, that's a tough thing when you're surprised in the middle of a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| So while I'm here, a couple more issues if I could bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| I've been in contact with the owners of this project for over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| It was started back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| I have been told on many occasions by both owners that when this project would move ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| that they would give the property owners that had property adjoining this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| we would have an opportunity to purchase the property and extend our lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| That has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| A question on staff or engineering regarding the transportation impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| Is not a requirement for a left-turn lane into the site with this many lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2093)|
| 0:35:03| I don't believe there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I'm in Stormwater, and I did not review the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| And Fritz may be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2109)|
| 0:35:28| Aaron Fritz, Knox County Engineering, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| To my recollection, the traffic study did not identify any off-site improvements on Highland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| I believe it's mainly the through traffic on Highland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| because you've got to have a pretty large volume of traffic on the main line to warrant a right-turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| But, yeah, I don't believe that that right-turn lane was not included in the traffic impact study as a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| I think I was referencing a left-turn lane into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| I don't believe any turn lanes were recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Nothing was included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| No left or right turn lanes were recommended as part of that study, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Can you tell me who did the study for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| He's telling me that Ajax Engineering is the one that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Ajax Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I did not recall that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| A question for staff on the density of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| Under the current zoning that was approved, they could go up to, I think, 1.47 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| And then under –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| so there's a difference of about 17 sites, I mean, 17 tracks that could be added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2205)|
| 0:36:54| How would that be shown up on the final plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Is there a restriction on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Because if somebody buys a 25-acre track, they may think, well, we're going to sum this thing up in smaller tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| Is there going to be a notation on the plat that says that it's limited to 17 additional sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| It's the use and review approval that would govern the number of units out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| So anybody, because it's PR zoning, if they came in and wanted to subdivide the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| they would have to get a use and review approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| and through that would have to identify that they're in compliance with the density limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| I'm in full support of the 22-foot pavement width and the additional sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Just a couple of questions for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| I see on your plan, as you come in off of the road on the right and left side where the lot's back up to a 1.46-acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2267)|
| 0:37:57| and I'm sorry, it's so small I can't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Is that common area, or what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Okay, so there is a common area buffer between the new proposed homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| and the existing backyards of the homes that adjoin it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| It's wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| So that will remain wooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Can you tell me anything about an amenity or anything that you plan on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| I think I'm like Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I kind of think that the 22-foot reduced road with the sidewalks would be a good thing to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| Is there another amenity or anything that you plan for the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I mean, they don't really know what they want to do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| as far as their amenity other than offering up the land, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| and maybe just let maybe their market dictate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| How far away is the sewer you're running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I mean, it was originally approved as a septic tank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| and you all have decided you're going to run sewer from some distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| They're working with Knox Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| and it's coming from the Breeden Lane pump station right on Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Then they'll run it at Pickens Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| It's about two, a little over two-and-a-half miles that they're going to run the force main to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| We'll have a low-pressure sewer system in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| We'll pump up to a common pump station, and that will pump into Knox Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| which will open up sewer for everybody down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| So, I mean, would it benefit the residents that it would be able to tie on if they decided they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| so there is some benefit there as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| All right, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I just wanted to add that I support the reduced pavement width to 22 foot with the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| I think that's always a wise decision for us to make whenever we can include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| That's going to be our next vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| But this one is we've got a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| a second by Commissioner Uten to approve variances one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| I don't see any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Back to the sidewalks, if you reduce the pavement down to 22 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| is that sidewalks on both sides of the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Just one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| One side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| We have a motion and a second to approve the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I'd like to make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| Moving on to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2459)|
| 0:41:10| Subdivision report concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| The subdivision is Steel Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| The applicant developer is Hardin Valley Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| The location is the south side of Hardin Valley Road, west of Pellissippi Parkway, south end of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| Approximate acreage is 30.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Current zoning is PR planned residential, CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| Existing land use is vacant land, and the proposed use is attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Number of lots is 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| There are six subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| We will have three votes and one approved waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| We will have three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| One is to approve the variances one through six because the site's topography and shape restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| The second vote will be approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and the third vote will be to approve the development plan for up to 91 attached dwelling units on individual lots subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| The applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I'm John Valley, and I represent the applicant, and we would request that you adopt the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| Would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| I reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| First, I want to thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you all for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| You all have a great responsibility to the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| especially now when both the community and the county are looking more closely at land use and development throughout our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| and placing a greater importance on planning, for which I'm grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| I think it's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| But as those who are the decision-makers on land use decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| you're kind of caught in the transition of moving from a very fluid approach to a more static approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| But I think we all agree that it has to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| and there are several items on the agenda today that gives you the opportunity to take steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| first steps, in upholding planning recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| One, they're developed by experts, and two, they include all of the stakeholders, and that includes the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2623)|
| 0:43:52| I just want everyone who is present here today that supports upholding sector plans and all plans, if they would just stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2632)|
| 0:44:03| That's a good-looking group, and they're here to support you to uphold planning and the plans that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2643)|
| 0:44:13| As I hope you're aware by now, Hardin Valley Planning Advocates is an organized community group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| supporting managed growth and planned infrastructure with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| As part of our efforts, we initiated the ongoing traffic mobility study to be followed by a small area plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| to further define existing and future needs of the fastest-growing sector in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| There are many developments and have been many land use decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| that have dismissed the cumulative impact on our community, our schools, and our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Month after month, this body, often in accordance with the Planning Commission's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| based on their recommendations, have rezoned and amended sector plans that benefited very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2689)|
| 0:44:57| I can't do much to change those decisions, but going forward, I can, and I hope to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| have an impact on the way our county and this board guides land use in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| So I sincerely hope that moving forward that I don't have to come before you time and time again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| to change your mind on a specific agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I want to change the way we all think about land use and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| and that begins with a comprehensive growth plan and upholding sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| With that said, this item and land has come before you several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| November 12, 2015, September 8, 2016, and October 23, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| It has been reviewed by civil engineers for almost four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| trying to determine the type of development that this topography can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| During those four years, as you are aware, a lot has changed in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and the zoning of low-density residential 0 to 3 was granted prior to community advocacy for managed growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| but more importantly, it was granted prior to the completion of nearly 20 completed subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| and three major-scale apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| In addition, the proposed development does not align with existing developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| nor does it meet a demographic need in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| The proposed two-bedroom, single-car garage, high-end units are not targeted at family living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| working, or considering living in Hardin Valley as their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| The target audience seems to be a dual or single income, no kids, retired professionals, couples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| My research shows that the likelihood of targeted groups purchasing a home across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| from three schools with severe road congestion is highly unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| So, fiscally speaking, this development doesn't provide an opportunity for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| As you all know, traffic, overcrowded schools, and scenic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| is very important to our residents and our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| This development works against us on all fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| As I've said time and time again, Hardin Valley Planning Advocates does not oppose development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| We support appropriate value-added growth with planned infrastructure and conservation concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| I am sure that the proposed development will be beautiful and appealing to many and have several perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| However, Hardin Valley cannot tolerate the cons that this development would introduce to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| For me personally, this is a tough one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| because the owner and the applicant is an outstanding community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| However, I feel that the applicant and the engineers kind of just landed on this concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| because the land itself has development difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| So in their effort to find a plan that yields the greatest return on investment for the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| we're trying to force a square peg into a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| The zoning is planned residential general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| and the community would prefer that the applicant and his engineers consider shifting their concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| and seizing this opportunity to bring in more businesses that offer employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| I have one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Social and health infrastructure needs reduces the number of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| but maintains ten conditions outlined in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| The staff report, I think, in listening to Kim's talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| I didn't hear really anything that contained any empirical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| that was against this development or against the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| It conforms to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| It conforms to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| There's been a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Apparently, they don't think there's much impact on traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| and there's no impact on the school that said it would yield a net of seven students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| What I also heard Ms. Frazier talk about are things that are sort of anecdotal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2951)|
| 0:49:24| It's observations and things that the community doesn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And she said something about the proposed development does not align with existing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| or that it is not targeted for families or families considering Hardin Valley as their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2975)|
| 0:49:45| I guess that's an opinion, but there's nothing that anybody can show that backs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| that it's not targeted to families for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And as far as it doesn't provide an opportunity for fiscal success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| I think the market has to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| It's not whether or not the Hardin Valley homeowners don't think it's going to be financially successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| It's whether or not the developers who are putting all the money in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| and the market's going to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And whether or not people are going to move into it or not is yet to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Obviously, there's a great demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one through six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| because the site's topography and shape compliance with subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| and proposed variances won't create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| We had a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Was that you, Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Yeah, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Second by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| We do have some other lights on, so we are not going to be taking a vote at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Commissioner Newton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Yeah, same as Ms. Frazier, this one's a little tough for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| because I'm a part of the Hardin Valley Planning Advocacy Group and the committees and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and have been working with the community on different types of development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| And from what I've understood over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| one of the big concerns, and we've got some other zonings out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| that contradict this type of development with apartments and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| but at least this particular development is a condo development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| which I think Hardin Valley has asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| They said they're done with apartments and they want more condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| and I think that this is at a density that's very low, and it's a condo product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| It's got a commercial component with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| which I know Hardin Valley wants some really super nice commercial that is walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| and I think this developer has probably done the nicest commercial center out in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| so he would probably have a good opportunity to do another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| and I would hope that he would listen to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| and do work with them on what type of commercial goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| push the envelope a little bit, and do something super nice across from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| and trust that this would be a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| We have a motion on the table and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| and I don't see any other lights on except for Commissioner Utens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| who probably just left his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| The variance is one through six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Motion to approve the concept plan subject to the ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Motion to approve the development plan for up to 91 attached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| on individual lots subject to the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Moving on to agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3226)|
| 0:53:56| This is a subdivision report concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| The subdivision is Terra Vista Townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| Applicant developer is Masana Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| The location is southeast of Higdon Road, south of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| west of Byington Solway Road, off Terra Vista Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| Approximate acreage is 43.36 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Current zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| The existing land use is vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| and the proposed use is attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| The number of lots is 87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| There is one subdivision variance required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| and this is, again, going to be three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Staff recommendation vote number one is approve the variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| because the width restriction would limit the proposed clustering on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| and the proposed variance will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| The second vote will be approve the concept plan subject to five conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| and the third vote will be approve the development plan for up to 71 attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| residential units on individual lots subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| I am assuming the applicant would like the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| It's actually not opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| It's not opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| I just wanted to, Kim Frazier, 11835, I just wanted to quickly state that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| this is another positive comment that I've actually talked to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| and we are taking a look at the seven, almost eight acres that cannot be used for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| but also could be considered as a spot park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| and he has agreed to reach out to Carol Evans at Legacy Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| and so I just wanted to state that we've been in discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| and that is on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| and that's just another great way that developers and community members can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Applicant, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| We just ask that you adopt staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3375)|
| 0:56:30| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| because the width of the restriction would limit the proposed clustering of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| and the proposed variance will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3397)|

| 0:58:01| The applicant is Tarantella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Construction location is the south side of East Beaver Creek Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| southwest of Dry Gap Pike at Collip Crossing Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| The approximate size of the tract is 6.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Zoning requested is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| The existing land use is RR rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Proposed use is single family detached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3512)|

| 0:58:48| planned residential zoning up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| My name is Rodney Harris and my wife, Debbie Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| We live at 1306 East Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I have a neighbor that is 1308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| I have a letter here that he has sent with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I would like to submit his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| But my concern is this, that that's quite a few units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| I live on a small piece of property on the east side of 1108 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| And the concern is, as they do construction in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| I'm not opposed to anybody making money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| but I am opposed to how many units will be in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| and how many units of the topsoil will be took out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| And we have a down climb that comes down on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| on the existing property at 1308 too, because there's a pond on 1108| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| and then there's a pond down on 1302 on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| When it rains, it comes down, and the water just comes off that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| And we're concerned about there's a lot of limestone in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| and it comes from under the ground and comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| I have a garden in there. I have a lot of landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And I'm concerned about muddy water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| I know a felt fence would not stop that water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| because it has to go somewhere. It's got to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Also, I have another concern regarding that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| I had seen some surveyors out there surveying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| and I have a picture of some surveying ribbons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| that looks like a possible easement to come across my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| I don't know. It just seemed like common sense tells me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| because on the existing property across from 1306,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| there is a, let me see, I'm at 234-02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| There's a little piece of property next to it, 234-03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| That's where a manhole is. That's where a utility sewage drainage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| And that's the closest it seems to be to where they want to put that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| I will not allow any easement across my property at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| because I don't have very much property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| and I don't want it controlled by utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| So that being said, plus the congestion of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| is already pretty high on Dry Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| because the property behind 1308,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| they just now changed it from agricultural to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| So I don't know what they're going to be building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| but since I've lived there for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| we bought it because it was agricultural, and we like it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| But like I said, I'm not opposed to anybody trying to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| There have been at least six subdivisions come in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| How many more are you going to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| I mean, so that's our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| If I could submit this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| Please give them to Mr. Breschke over there at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| And a picture of what I had come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| My stuff. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you for your time. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Yes, I am David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| the engineer surveyor for Mr. Trantinella on this project right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| A lot of those issues that were mentioned will be handled there in the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| For the rezoning, as you can see right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| there's PR, planned residentials in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Plenty of other residentially developed properties are in the area as well right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| So our use, it matches with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| and our use will be what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| We'll match very nicely with what's out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| We plan to build single-family detached houses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| For the sewer plan, he does have a sewer back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| If we can't get into that one, there's sewer along Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| We could pump over to that if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| So the utilities are in sight or available for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| And sort of hesitant to get too much into the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| What I'll do for the stormwater right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| we'll put a diversion ditch in for everything up above us right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| and we'll just bypass around our construction site for anything that flows there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| and build a big sediment basin and keep all the sediment from going off of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| But anyway, with that all being said, we're in agreement with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Like I said, we match the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| We're going to match the community that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| We just urge that the Planning Commissioners vote per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you. Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| A question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| As I look at the rezoning page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| it looks like most of the developments in this area are less than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| So it's one to three dwelling units per acre, less than five, less than four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| How did you arrive at five units per acre on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Good question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I am a planner that reviewed this item, and we discussed it amongst all of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| We felt that five was appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| It's in line with the sector plan that allows up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| It's near a commercial node at the corner of Dry Gap Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| and East Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| There's commercial within 500 feet or so of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| So we felt that five was an acceptable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| And one point to that, Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| this property aligns very nicely to a lot of the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| There's environmental or slopes that would restrict what we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| but this is a very nice piece of ground out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| What are your grades, Mr. Armbruster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| There will be a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| There will be about a five- or six-foot cut coming right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| because it's pretty steep right off of Beaver Creek Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and then after that we'll just be just right on top of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| And staff is challenged with identifying those places where higher density is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| We realize that the county is continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| We have to accommodate the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Do we do that by allowing higher density in appropriate locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| or do we do that by allowing 2.5 units throughout the entire county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| There's a desire to preserve rural and agricultural lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| We can't do that unless we provide for density in certain locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| We try to do it within reason, matching the existing development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| but also realizing that there is a need to accommodate a growing population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| Balancing those two desires is often challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| and we look for those opportunities to accommodate the growing population, again, where appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| Mr. Harris, did you have something else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| I'd like to request a redesign for more green because five per acre, that's going to be ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| there's only five acres, 6.8 acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I mean, look how many homes is going to be right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| They already put a subdivision across the street from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| It's got over 40 of them right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Mr. Harris, this is a rezoning and just sets the parameters for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| This we'll have to come back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Keep an eye on the sign on the property that would go up for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| And at that time, the development plan would be posted on our website on the agenda page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| and you can comment on the design plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| That would be the appropriate time to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| And plus, I would just like to know how many ñ what kind of amenities are they going to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| I'm with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| I would feel a lot better about one to three or four, but it's been my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| and it's usually with a challenging piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| If you go higher with the approved density, you get a better development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| It doesn't always come out to the higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| But I understand what staff is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Gerald, I think that's smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I think it helps us preserve some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| It doesn't look like we're preserving much, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| But I'm going to go ahead and make a motion that we recommend that County Commission approve the PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| with up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| It sounded like a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| To recommend that County Commission approve the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Now it's time for agenda item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4100)|
| 1:08:30| This is a plan amendment rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| The applicant is Steve Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| The location is the west side of Triplett Lane, south of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| The tract information is 5.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| The present plan designation zoning is low density residential, RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| The proposed plan designation zoning is MDR medium density residential, PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| The existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| The proposed use is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| The density proposed is seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| We will have two votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| The first would be to adopt resolution number 5B19SP amending the southwest county sector plan to MDR medium density residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4158)|
| 1:09:31| and recommend that County Commission also adopt the sector plan amendment C attached resolution exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| Also the second vote would be to recommend that County Commission approve PR planned residential zoning up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4179)|
| 1:09:48| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| I'm John Valiant, 1650 First Tennessee Plaza, 600 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| I represent the applicant and we would ask that the Commission adopt the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| Up until today we were, or up until right before the meeting we thought we were on consent so we're not sure what any objections are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Yeah, we don't have an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| This is an internal thing and I just wanted to put it on the record that the commissioners on sector plan amendments would like to have them pulled out individually and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4220)|
| 1:10:37| We're talking in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| I just did this to get it on the record so that they're voted by themselves and discussed by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| And I appreciate that direction from the Commission and since it's on the record I'll remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| Henceforth when there's a sector plan amendment it will not be on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| And one of the things with sector plan amendments is we do need to go on record to say why the decision was made to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4261)|
| 1:11:16| So whoever is going to be making the motion, please be sure to also include the reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we adopt Resolution 5B19SP amending the Southwest County Sector Plan to MDR, medium density residential designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4284)|
| 1:11:34| and recommend the County Commission also adopt the sector plan amendment because the site's located within the planned growth area, urban growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4294)|
| 1:11:46| It's a thousand feet from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| It's just changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| All of those reasons are reasons why it should be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| And a second by Commissioner Smith to adopt the resolution amending the Southwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| I'd like to make a motion that we recommend the County Commission approve PR planned residential zoning up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4335)|
| 1:12:25| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Smith to approve planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Thank you, Commissioner Graff, for pointing this out and taking this off the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Thanks for staying and enjoying the meeting thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| As usual, thank the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Next on the agenda is item number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| The applicant is RML Construction, LLP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| The location is the northeast side of Solway Road at intersection of Greystone Summit Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| The approximate size of the tract is 8.37 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Present zoning is BP business and technology slash TO technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| Zoning requested is OB, office medical and related services slash TO technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| Existing land use is vacant, and the proposed use is any use allowed in OB slash TO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| Staff recommendation is to recommend that County Commission approve OB, office medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| slash TO technology overlay district zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| The applicant's present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I'm John Valiant, 1650 First Tennessee Plaza, 600 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Let me make room for Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| I didn't mean for this to be the Valiant-Frazier show today, but Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I wanted to just provide the opinion of Hardin Valley planning advocates and the Hardin Valley community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| on a prior approval on the larger parcel that is adjacent to this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Sadly, this request was approved during spring break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| and came at a pretty hectic time for most of us people who have families and children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| and actually a life outside of here, because I do, really I do, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| And so we were unable to attend the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| However, we've met with the applicant on several occasions to discuss not only this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| but the applicant's desire to be engaged in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and support the community's vision for land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| So far, he has done just that and just recently even donated lumber for outside art tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| at the Hardin Valley Academy for their art department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So we appreciate, we really do appreciate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| So speaking to this property, I'm sure that you all understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| but so that everyone here can understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| A zoning of OB, as stated in the Knox County zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| is intended to provide areas for professional and business offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| and related activities that require separate buildings and buildings groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| surrounded by landscape yards and open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| It goes on to say that an OB zoning district is for business offices, clinics, medical and dental offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| However, hotels and other supportive land uses are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| So once again, we find ourselves pushing land use as far as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| into the gray zones of zoning definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| In this case, under other supportive land uses also permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| So you're making this land use decision basically in the dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| a big old heaping help of dense darkness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| And so we find ourselves back at that place where a land use decision was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| without the introduction of a specified use and planning on a land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| because engineers are asked to find an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| for a difficult piece of property that will yield the best return on investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| rather than staying in line with the sector plan and the best use of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| which is business and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Although we were not present to oppose the original zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| it's the responsibility of this board to make decisions based on the cumulative impact of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| And as Knox County has pointed out in the recent coordinating committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| it's time that we consider the environmental and fiscal impact of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| and ensure that development aligns with school locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and do not further stress infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| By dismissing the appropriate intended use as outlined in the Northwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| decisions are being made, A, blindly and without properly being informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| or, B, based on the fiscal gain of only the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| not the community nor the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| I would like to see a fiscal analysis on the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| a marketing study and a concept plan before moving forward on this land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| And I would also like for this board to amend the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| and require concept plans on the front end with zoning and sector plan amendment requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| I am aware that the applicant has a concept plan for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| which would directly impact traffic and student yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| So having a plan would be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| If for nothing else, to be used as an example for learning how making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| without proper information can drastically change the course of development for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| This process needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| You can't just keep looking at individual pieces of a much greater puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| because they don't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| That is why we have plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| So please use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Before Mr. Valiant or Mr. Hickey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I'd like to try to address some of Mrs. Frazier's comments while I remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4697)|
| 1:18:27| I appreciate your comments regarding changing the process and the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| I, as well as many of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| probably realize that the Knox County zoning ordinance could use updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| It's many years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| It doesn't anticipate the type of development that is occurring in the county now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| nor the standards to which development is held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| Currently it was done 40, 50 years ago, and the development is certainly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| That's a long and tedious process and one I will not undertake again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| The first step is the general plan update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| where we get broad parameters for guiding the development of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| Then those parameters would be refined in a zoning ordinance update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| With regard to requiring a concept plan with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| we cannot limit the uses to that extent under our current zoning statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| The state legislation does not provide for conditional zoning, which that would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| We cannot limit the uses when the property is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| All the uses permitted in that zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| are considered by the staff and the commission in making that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| To implement that change, we take a change in the state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| which would allow conditional zoning, which in states I've worked in in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| is a great tool for addressing many of the concerns you've identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| and also helping the developers refine their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| and gain greater acceptance for it at the zoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| You've asked for some great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Unfortunately, we don't have those in place yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| but I appreciate your efforts at trying to move us in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| I do think a general plan update would be a good first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| in continuing to work with the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| And also addressing state legislation with regard to conditional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| which I think could be a good tool for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Then I'd like to encourage all of the commissioners to reach out to your state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| If that's something that you're encouraging me to do, I'd like for each of you to do that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| because we all have that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| I want to give a few brief comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| and I think Mr. Hickey with Ball Homes would like to make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| and then I'd like to come back if we have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| As you guys know from reading the staff report, this is consistent with the zoning order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| It's consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| It's compatible with the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| and it doesn't seem to me that it has any impact on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| There was not a traffic study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| This particular development is in a special area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| I was just going to talk about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| This property is in the Northwest County sector plan, and on page 41 of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| this exact parcel is in a 520-acre mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| And if you read that, the recommended uses are office, technology park, low Disney residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| medium Disney residential, and mixed-use commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| So when we filed this, we're understanding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| that we met the existing sector plan and wouldn't need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| I just wanted to make everyone aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| I thought I finished it, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| Kim talks about the physical impact, and this is a $30 million development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| This is going to have a good physical impact on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| Whether or not it's a successful venture from the developer standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| once again, is going to be a product of the market forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| It's going to be whether or not the people want to use whatever is developed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| Ms. Fraser, I think, was in error when she said there was a concept plan that showed apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| The engineers here, we haven't done the concept plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| It may be apartments. It may be mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| I don't know, and Mr. Hickey doesn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| and the reason I say I don't know is I asked him within the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| So we haven't developed the concept plan yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| but we certainly will as soon as we get through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| This is going to be a good project for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| It's going to be a good project for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| It's going to generate a lot of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| Let me interrupt just for a moment because it's come up twice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| I want to remind you that the fiscal or economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| is not an appropriate criteria to be employed in land-use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| It has nothing to do with the burden that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Currently, but that will probably change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| Yes, Ms. Fraser, you have a little bit of time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| I just wanted to address also there is a current traffic mobility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| being conducted for this area, and this is a major area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| If anything, I would like you all to consider postponing this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| until that traffic study is complete and can give us a little more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| because in that traffic study, there is a potential exit entrance ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5071)|
| 1:24:40| coming off of Pellissippi State directly linking Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5080)|
| 1:24:49| to Pellissippi Community College or Pellissippi State now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| So that's unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| So I would hope that we would have some time to see what that study is going to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| I'm sorry, Mr. Hickey, you do still have a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| I just wanted to point out that on the previous rezoning to the property just beside this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| we committed to doing a traffic study, and we'll commit the same to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| We committed to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Fulgham and McIndoe and Associates will be completing a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| for this property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| So I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| And also TDOT did bring up the possibility of them needing right-of-way on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| and Fulgham and McIndoe will be in contact with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| We were just made aware of that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| They'll be in contact with TDOT concerning this right-of-way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| One other thing that I didn't bring up was that the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| voted, said that this was an appropriate zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| and they approved, they gave a certificate of appropriateness for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Surprisingly, I don't agree with Ms. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| I think staff has it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| I think the process is, it goes in the correct order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| You need to know what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Nobody that's going to develop property, and I don't develop property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| but I would assume common sense tells you that nobody will develop a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| or do a concept plan for a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| They don't know what they can put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Having the zoning in place is the information that you need to make a good design decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| for the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Again, I was going to bring up that we aren't allowed to make a decision on land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| based on fiscal viability of any piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| and we have a pretty strict things of what we can and cannot consider, and that's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| So I think we should take into consideration, you know, the entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| not just Hardin Valley but Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| It would be great if the only thing we had to do was consider how Hardin Valley grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| but our task is bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Our task is what is Knox County going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| and Hardin Valley is a big, beautiful part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| and we need to make sure that it does grow correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| but we also need to make sure that we make good decisions on land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| based on the criteria that we know is best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| That being said, I'd like to make a motion that we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| that County Commission approve OB, Office of Medical and Related Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| TO, Technology Overlay, District Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| A motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| to recommend that County Commission approve the OB, TO, District Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| I see no additional lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| We're now on to Agenda Item Number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| It's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| The applicant is Christopher King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| The location is the south side of Millertown Pike at Terminus of Delmar Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| Approximate size of the tract is 2.15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| The zoning is 01, Office of Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| The existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| The proposed use is a church with a 264-seat sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| The staff recommendation is to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| for a 264-seat church subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| I see no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Sir, do you have something that you would like to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| This is Christopher King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| This is me, Busby Architects, 2554 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| I just appreciate the hard decisions that you have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| and what I observed here today is that as density increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| the edges of that density are interesting and convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| In this case, we feel like this is a good transition in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| from the adjacent commercial property to the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| There have been some concerns raised by residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| but we think that we have addressed all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| It looks like you have addressed all of them because I see no opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| for a 264-seat church subject to the 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| a second by Commissioner Buston to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| Next on the agenda is a consideration of amendment to the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| Knox County subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| and I am going to turn this one over to Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| Madam Chair, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| staff is recommending approval of these proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| with a recommendation of a 90-day time period before it becomes effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5453)|
| 1:31:02| The main change within the subdivision regulations on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| is the delegation of final plat review from the planning commission to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| It has required a number of changes within the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| review procedures for plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| We've also included some minor changes within the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| regarding right-of-way dedication on city and county road projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| allowing a provision where Knox County and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| can not only approve a reduction of right-of-way, I mean pavement width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| but also right-of-way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| There are some changes in the double frontage lot standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| where we identified a couple different options regarding that 150-foot lot depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| One of the other main issues within this is the sign-off and final plats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| by the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| They do not have jurisdiction over the sewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| but they've been signing off on plats for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| so they've asked to be removed from that sign-off requirement on final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| We've added a simple wording in there regarding sign-off by the utility company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| on that sewer is available as constructed or as approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| We've also added that provision for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I know there had been some question at the agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| as to whether or not we've given adequate time to address this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| with the utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| We have not gone over in detail with all the utilities on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| We did work closely with KUB as far as showing the wording that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5568)|
| 1:32:56| I've talked this morning later to Troy Wedekind with the First Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| explained that with the 90-day implementation period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| there's going to have to be a lot of administrative details that are worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| in our process to make tracking the plats available to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| providing all plats to the utility companies for their review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| and so they're aware of what's going to be coming for them for final sign-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| And talking to Troy Wedekind, he felt that that 90-day review period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| a time frame until implementation of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| would be adequate to try to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| If there is something that comes up out of that time of working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| we can bring it back to the Planning Commission for an additional amendment if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| He said they were actually looking forward to having more opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| to look at plats through the process, which they don't right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| I was initially yesterday concerned, very much so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| just about the platting process and making sure that there would be no further delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| with the coordination of the utility districts and their required signatures on these plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| I talked to Troy this morning, and he had not seen any verbiage of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| and I let Tom know, and so I'm glad Tom called him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| and had a call into Wayne Hastings at West Knox Utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| and I haven't heard back from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| I don't want to get in the way of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| My concern is that when we go to record plats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| that's how you get to a position to transfer property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and it just concerns me because the language the utility districts will have to sign off on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| is going to be very important, and we want to make sure we don't have a hard time getting plats signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| I'm fine if the body decides to go ahead and move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| and in this 90 days, if someone could just assure me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| that either some people from the development community would be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| in whatever meetings with utility districts to iron out the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| and just make sure it's going to be a smooth process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| and not that we'll have this just hanging out there for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| And there's another issue that I'd like to have revisited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| and I'm going to get with Gerald on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| and that's some things on some sidewalk issues that have been hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| This is the time to get this all resolved, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| So let's use this 90-day period, resolve those two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| Should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| If they're not resolved, maybe we get another 60 days to get them worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| and I'm good with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| And we'll make that commitment to have the developers involved with the utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| and drafting the wording for the utility sign-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| and making that process smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We think that's a necessary effort since the health department has been basically charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| with the duty that's not their responsibility under our current code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| and putting it in the proper place, assuring that utilities can be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| As we discussed, we'll make a commitment to addressing the sidewalk issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| and taking care of that so that we don't have issues like we had with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| I think, the first subdivision we had today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| where at the last minute there's a question about sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and we need to make it clear when sidewalks should be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| when they can be waived, and work with the development community on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| So those were my two concerns, and I just want to also say that, overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| I think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I mean, I think it's a big improvement over what we had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| and I'd like to thank them for all their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Thank Tom for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| I think, overall, everything looks really a lot better than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| This is the last time, by the way. I don't want to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| First of all, I'd like to thank Commissioner Smith for his wisdom and input on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5811)|
| 1:37:00| It's a classic example of why we should have developers on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| even though it seems like it's a conflict sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| On Tuesday, I learned a lot more about this amendment than I knew when I first read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| just by Commissioner Smith's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| So I think I'd like to thank him for his wisdom on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| I'd also like to thank Tom for all his work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| and I'd like to make the motion that we approve the proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| to the Knoxville-Knox County Subdivision Regulations with an effective date of August 7, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| Now, Tom, don't try to sneak anything else in on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| I'm just approving this. I know how you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| to approve the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| I see no other lights on. I see no one at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Are there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| And I might say that this is the first Planning Commission meeting that I believe that we've all voted unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5882)|
| 1:38:11| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/Planning190509?start=5891)|
