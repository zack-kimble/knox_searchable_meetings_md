| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Well, I want to go ahead and start this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| Everybody's got something to eat and or drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Let me let me explain to the audience what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| City Council, our first meeting of every month, we have a dinner and we meet in the conference room upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| And we generally just chat casually or perhaps we have somebody to come in and talk to us about their department or whatever endeavor they're doing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=46)|
| 0:00:55| But tonight we are going to have a discussion about how we will process not not content, but how we will process recode in the months ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=55)|
| 0:01:08| So we're going to try to figure out when to do workshops, what the content of the workshop may be and try not to fall over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| But before we get started on that, I do have a question for my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| I've been trying to line up a time that we can have our annual retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| So far, I've been unsuccessful in coordinating times that what I think most of you all can come and the mayor's schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| So the date that I have to offer now is February the twenty third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| That's a Saturday. And I don't know if everybody's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| Well, we could. I mean, we could back it up to March, but I'm open that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| I could do it. Well, kind of pencil that in right now. The mayor's agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| And Jeannie and Tim have agreed to that. So we have some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| Now, this is not a formal workshop, but I think we're going to treat it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| So, Rob, Mr. Frost, rather, you want to make some comments about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor. The purpose for council tonight is to discuss the process and the planning for this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| It wasn't noticed to the public that council was going to be discussing the pros and cons of any particular element of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=138)|
| 0:02:30| But it was really just let's talk about workshops coming up, how we want to structure things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| if there's going to be anything for the end of the year and what's going into twenty nineteen and then twenty twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=157)|
| 0:02:47| I thought I'd get your attention. Hopefully it will be done in twenty nineteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| But it's really to talk about just how council thinks they want to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| obviously taking into account the stakeholder advisory committee and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| Thank you. So this is going to be a little bit, I hope, freewheeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| While I have some ideas, I suspect you all do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| At the end of our discussion, there will be a moment, we hope, we'll see how long we take for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| But the comment will only be in regards to the process, not the content of the of the recode proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=201)|
| 0:03:30| All right. So I have spoken, as I suspect many of you have, to Mr. Green, the MPC, about this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=210)|
| 0:03:40| And I know many of you have been to several workshops regarding recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| So you've heard a lot of the content. I'm going to throw out a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| And I think all of us got an e-mail from our former vice mayor, Dwayne Greve, making a suggestion, which I rather liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=230)|
| 0:04:01| For those of you who were on council for a while, we kind of did a similar thing with the sign ordinance several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| And that is to kind of try to break it down into some pieces instead of doing the whole thing several times at workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| And so that would be my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| What my specific proposal is, is to take it in two or three chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| The first workshop, in my mind, and this is not in concrete by any stretch, would be the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| That would be Article 4 and Article 6, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| And then a second workshop on residential, which is Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| And then everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Now, of course, along the way, as we discuss commercial, industrial, residential, et cetera, many of the other areas, other articles will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=289)|
| 0:04:59| So they will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| So was that one workshop for commercial, one workshop for residential, and one workshop for everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| Essentially, I would throw in industrial with commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| I guess my concern would be that, I think especially when we're talking about the residential, that we probably should reserve two dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| Because I don't know that we'll get through all of that in one workshop unless it's going to be a marathon session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| So I would suggest maybe carving out time for up to two workshops in each area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| That way, if we need a second workshop to finish up, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Well, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Now, the workshops, as everybody knows, are generally on the off Thursdays, 530 in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| And I know Mr. Johnson has reserved this room for those Thursdays throughout 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| If we choose to do something in December, and I don't know, this is where Gerald is going to have to chime in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| regarding your schedule in terms of the stakeholders, as Rob mentioned, and the commissioners themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=365)|
| 0:06:15| When are they going to opine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Because personally, and I don't know how my colleagues feel, but I would like to get this thing in as clean a condition as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| In other words, there's going to be a lot of discussion at the stakeholders, and I don't know if you have scheduled those days yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| No, we're still trying to schedule the stakeholders' workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| We've done a couple of doodle polls, trying to find a time when 20 people can meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| At the same time, it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| We also have the planning commission workshops, and I think the workshop that the planning commission had last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| where several city council members were in attendance, was an outstanding workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| The communication between the two boards, I guess my one thought is that having six city council workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=414)|
| 0:07:07| and your workshops at every other meeting, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| That is, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| If you want six workshops, have three a week and get them over with, is my suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| and move through this and not prolong it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| I think we've been, and maybe you don't have three in one week, but start condensing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Don't spread them out over three, four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| By that time, we'll forget the answers we got on the first workshop and have to repeat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| I think we're at the point where, and I don't like to differ with Councilman Roberto, but I will in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=460)|
| 0:07:50| I think the issues have been narrowed down somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| I'm not sure that the issues that remain require two workshops on residential, two on commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| I think we're getting pretty close with the comments we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Staff, and when I say staff, I mean the MPC staff, city staff, and the Camaro staff, can identify those key issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| provide you background information, and prepare you well for the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| I think that's a key item, is you being prepared for the workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| knowing the issues that we've identified based on comments we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and the feedback we've gotten from the community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Of course, you can add others, but trying to, I'd like to see this project finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=514)|
| 0:08:43| in a due course of time, with all due diligence, but not prolong it more than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Well, it may be helpful, and once again, my colleagues, please weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| as we did last week or with the Commission, if we would be invited to those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| that might be helpful, it might move this thing along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| And the Commission has requested that the City Council be invited to all the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Oh, good. Well, I personally would like to. Ms. Welsh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| I was just going to suggest, I mean, if you think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| there will be two Stakeholder Advisory Committee workshops that we're trying to schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| that are sort of half-day workshops, and then there'll be, how many MPCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| At least two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| At least two MPC workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I would think that if we scheduled four sessions with the goal of getting through in three sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=566)|
| 0:09:35| but having a reserved session just in case we needed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| that seems like it might be reasonable to me, given the amount of processing that will happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| between two more Stakeholder Advisory Committees, two MPC workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| All of those are open to all of Council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| So that would be, I don't disagree, there's a lot to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| but I think that Council will not be the only place to discuss those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| And so I appreciate the Council being invited to the MPC workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| because I think that that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| However, our Council members are not necessarily available for each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| and so therefore I feel like we do need to have separate meetings specific for Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| that we all are in agreement that we can meet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| I understand that a lot of work has gone into this, and there's some time sensitivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| However, I feel like if we are making decisions on zoning and coding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| that is going to be in effect for the next 50-plus years, we really have to do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| And so I do not want to feel that we're rushing into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| I do think that maybe the four workshops, but I also want to leave that door open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| if we run into some debate or some areas that we feel like we need further clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| If that takes us into a fifth meeting, I feel like we will need to schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| What about gathering some of these workshops up closer in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| instead of doing it every other Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I mean, could we do them every week for a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| This has been on the table for so long now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Once again, that may be a problem just in scheduling and room availability and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Well, I thought Director Green made a good point there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| and that was if you have two weeks in between your workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| I think it's going to be difficult to necessarily recall where you were, where you were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| So I think to your point about trying to have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| maybe we'll have to have some additional dates that we can schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| outside of the already reserved dates in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| The other thing I wanted to ask Director Green about that I'm concerned with too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| is it certainly seemed like in our last joint workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| that there is another draft that's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And so I was wondering if you have a date that you're thinking that draft will come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| and if that will be the final version because it's a little bit of a moving target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| if we start having a discussion and then it turns out that the content has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| And there are two options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| One is to continue working with the draft we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| We have now given all the workshops, make all the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| and create a final draft that is presented to the planning commission for their review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| the stakeholders, and then ultimately city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| The other option is to take comments through the late this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| create a final draft, a fourth draft that will then go to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| and be the subject of workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| I'd like to hear your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| I'm leaning towards the second option of having a fourth draft available near the end of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| first of next month for the workshops and consideration by the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| the planning commission, and the council during their workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| The final draft will be the one that's presented to you the night you adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| That's a challenge is that this is somewhat a moving target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| because we'll always be making minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| I would imagine on the night of adoption that there will be some revisions made at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| But I do think if we can address the comments we've received thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| and provide an additional couple of weeks for public input and create a fourth draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| that would give the council, the planning commission, and the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| a better base on which to make their comments and hold your workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Vice Mayor, I would like to ask that we may be taking into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| a half or full day, maybe Saturday session as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| That may be able to kind of help us drill down a little bit more on the number of meetings that we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| So maybe we can consider that amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Can I just ask, Director Green, so like the workshop that was on the 31st, I'm looking at CTV Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| Was that recorded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Because I was apparently like the only council member that wasn't able to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I feel left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| I know we've requested CTV to record most of those workshops, and I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| but I'll have to confirm because I don't, to be honest, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Because I see on CTV they've done a lot of the public workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| but I feel like I missed a lot of good information at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| And then I guess the stakeholders' meetings are typically recorded, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| So I guess my request is if there were workshops, I appreciate being invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| and I will try my best to make them to all, but if they're not, if they can be recorded, I will watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| Mr. Frost just made a really interesting suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| As we consider setting up some workshops about, for instance, commercial and industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| if MPC could provide us just their updates on that and not the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| maybe that would move this thing along because there's an awful lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| There's an awful lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| I don't know if you all can massage that so you just deal with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| We'll certainly try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| I think that's a good idea, and we'll certainly watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| And that same thing could go for residential or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| I was just, obviously they're all intertwined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| but commercial has received probably the least amount of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| where you could have the commercial next draft ready for council to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| and leave the comment period open for your residential and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| and that next draft comes out at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Other comments about what we've just been talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Because now I'd like to talk a moment, if we can, and this is going to be the ticklish part, and that is when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| When are we going to start these workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| And that's why I just mentioned cutting out commercial and industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| setting them aside and doing them maybe as early as December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| I don't know whether you'll be ready or whether we'll be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I can be ready if you tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Please keep in mind that MPC, meaning absolutely me, also staffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| the county commission and the planning commission and certain other boards are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| When we pick dates, there are some that may work for you, may not work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Well, if we did something in December, I would say, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| the fourth is our regularly scheduled council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| The 13th would be a regularly scheduled workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| The 13th won't work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| That's the MPC meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| That evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| That evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| The meetings start and could go as late as, I think our latest has been seven or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| I have no idea how late the meetings would go, and I'd be hesitant to schedule a meeting, a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| I wouldn't have time to prepare for both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'd say that getting past that, you're getting too close to the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| We just need to look in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| So the next one would probably be, we're actually scheduled, and we're not going to have it, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| to have a council meeting on January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Given that that's New Year's Day, we've punted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| I know we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| We've freed up our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| We could do something as early as the 3rd, unless everybody's still out of town or whatever they're doing for the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1083)|
| 0:18:13| My work schedule, I will be in Nashville the first week in Nashville, maybe part of the second week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| So maybe the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| I don't see anybody rebelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I'll be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| That's an MPC meeting date, and I won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| I have a conflict on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| We may have to do an alarm listing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Should we open up some other days, Monday, Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Once again, it's room availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| It may not be this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| It may be the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It may be the engineering facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| It may be a different facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And I think we're going to have to maybe agree that if we're scheduling four to six, four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| that we're not going to find a date that everybody works for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| I think another issue I had, in terms of these workshops, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| are we going to be trying to reach consensus on some of the issues and having sort of votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| Because at least with the signed ordinance, I mean, eventually what happened is on the contentious issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| I mean, someone has to make a motion that they think it should be amended, and, you know, do they get five votes to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| That would come at the council meeting and not at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| We might take a straw poll at the workshop to see where we are, but that's really all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Go ahead, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| As a suggestion about dates and rooms, maybe tomorrow Ms. Hopper can start check room availabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| whether it's this room next door or the public works facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| and then start a, you know, whatever Google calendar check thing and include Mr. Green on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| And she might be able to find, making up here, ten available times that she can send out all at once, and that might be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Does that suit you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| I mean, I'm not opposed to having more than one in one week if we're trying to just muscle through it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| And it may not be that all of us can attend every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| As best we can, we certainly need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| But if we're out of town, if we have business interests that interfere, then that's just what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Well, and I'll piggyback on what Councilman Starr was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I'm of the opinion that I think in the workshops, since the amount of work that we have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| it would make sense to actually vote on any amendments in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| Now, that doesn't preclude anyone from doing amendments at council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| but now, unless I'm advised by council that we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| But that would be my thought, because you're going to get swamped with a lot of potential changes in that council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| At a workshop, all you can do is take a straw poll on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| I mean, if, for example, here, there's a straw poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| and seven members of city council suggested that they wanted to see something done with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| that's a pretty good indication that even if a vote or two changes, it's an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| But workshops are just straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| But we were still considering having a special council meeting that would address only RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| And that would, depending on how the workshops go and how much consensus there appears to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| if we have a special call meeting, it would probably be on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And, once again, it may interfere with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| As long as it's not the second Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| What we did with the sign ordinance was we did have a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| and it had been so vetted that by the time it came up for a vote, we amended it several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| and then we put it on emergency so we didn't have to come back and do a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| This thing had been vetted and vetted and vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| and I don't know, MPC has had probably close to 60 or some 60-plus meetings about this public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1332)|
| 0:22:22| Well, I don't want to cut it short, but if there are at least three or four more by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| and then several by the commission with council, if we can come, and the stakeholders meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| that's probably going to be a total of about six or eight more meetings total, if you add all that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| I'm just guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| So I think what I'm hearing, and you all tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| is that we're kind of aiming for early January to receive whatever and set up our first workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Because if we can't do it, whatever I mentioned, in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| then it's really getting too close to the holidays to really get a good feel for what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| But then we'd have to postpone it until early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| And with that direction, that helps some in determining when the next draft will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| We'll maybe pose November 20th as the cutoff date for comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| so that we can work with the consultants to have a fourth draft sometime in the first part of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| that would go on to the planning commission for their review and possible recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| I'm not sure where they will be in their workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| but at least we'll have a somewhat final draft on which we can base the workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| and the comments and the direction that we're going with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| Any other comments, dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Well, I guess one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| So with these workshops, would the draft theoretically be amended as a result of these workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| And that's what I meant by my response to Councilmember Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| that even though we have what we think is a final draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| at any time a comment by the council to revise that means that until that document is adopted, it's subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| And so would it be helpful if one of us feels that something should be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| to bring that forward during those workshops and try to build consensus around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| That would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Then we will stop this portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| I think we have a general agreement here, and there's some in the public that may want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| We'd be happy to listen to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| If not, we will adjourn and reconvene in 19 minutes at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you for coming early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877181106?start=1495)|
