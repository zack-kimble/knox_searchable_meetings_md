| 0:14:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| So we are on to agenda item number five, the Knoxville-Knox County planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| and I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Green to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| The ordinance amendment before you would establish a planned development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| under the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| The planned development approval process is one that is designed to encourage creativity and new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| and provide the planning commission and the county commission with flexibility in the approval of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| The commission has heard about this on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| It's been continued since, I believe, April, and the commission has held a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and it's also been discussed at your agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| so I'll not spend a great deal of time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I'll try to address those issues which have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| It does provide for a public hearing process that allows for plans to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| and grant it flexibility in waivers from underlying use and design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| dimensional standards, through a public process that includes public hearings before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| And I want to note that on your cover memo, I didn't change from the first cover memo in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| a statement that the county commission would approve the final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| following the approval of the preliminary plan by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| and the planning commission would approve the final plan on that memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| During the review of this and discussion with staff and comments from the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| the final plan approval was delegated to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| because it has to be in compliance with the approved preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| I'll mention that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| I want you to keep that in mind and know that there was some discrepancy there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| and heard comments from the public that they would like the final plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| to be in a public forum before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| In addressing some of the comments, most recent comments from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| especially with how to make up the design team or who should be on the design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| if there's any mandate for membership on that design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| and trying to encourage flexibility in the purpose statement 6.80.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| some new language has been added stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| plan submitted for approval as provided for by this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| must demonstrate a creative approach to the design of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| and the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| The design team shall be capable of presenting a creative project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| that will deliver multiple community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| This tries to get to those issues that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| without specifying who should be on the design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| because that varies from project to project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| letting the design team and the applicants know that we expect a design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| capable of creating a creative design plan for that project and carrying it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| Also to iterate in the purpose that we expect a creative plan for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Moving on, any time you have a question, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| There was some discussion about the minimum size for a plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and under 6.80.04 authorization, this is on the top of page 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| a new statement has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| A plan development shall be a minimum of 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| The calculation of the acreage shall exclude areas covered with permanent bodies of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| lakes, rivers, streams, excluding farm ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| This is trying to address those areas that we've seen where property lines go to the center of the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| and it's hard to develop property that's underwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| so it would make it clear that those areas are excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| And 6.80.04C, we had discussed the community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1110)|
| 0:18:39| and how we could encourage community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| The new language there is plan development shall demonstrate significant benefits to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| as identified and validated during the review of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| That, again, lets the applicant know that they must provide community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and puts it before the commission to determine what those community benefits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| We discussed having a certain number of community benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| but there may be one significant benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| One of the staff pointed out what if a new development provides the land for a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| sets aside 10 or 20 acres in the development for a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| That's one benefit, but it's a significant benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| So that's something that we're making clear that have to be significant benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| but it lives in the purview of the planning commission and on to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| to determine if those benefits are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Going on down in that, at the top of page 3, we clarified a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| The affordable housing set aside, provided that the affordable housing meets the standards of affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| such that the cost of the housing does not exceed 30% of the Knox County median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| And that's the usual determinant for affordable housing, 30% of your income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| and the median income in Knox County is about $42,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| so that would mean 30% of that is just about $13,000 or about $1,000 a month for rent or the house payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1203)|
| 0:20:13| And number nine on that is land set aside for public facilities such as schools, libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| and emergency services would be considered a community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| And on 680.5 procedure subsection B3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| clarifying that mail and post-it notice is required for the meeting at which the concept plan is to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| and this is to allow the public adequate notification clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| That's all the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I would note that the provision for final plan approval by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| I can understand the desire of the community to have that in the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| I'll take the direction from the commission with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| And I apologize for not catching that in the cover memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| That's what I get for trying to be efficient in cutting and pasting and using the same memo over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| but I apologize for missing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Mr. Green, one question that I have under 6.80.04 on page 2, part B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| one of the things that we had talked about in our agenda review is the exceptions from district regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| may be granted for plan developments if the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| It's still unclear whether all six of these must be met or any one or if these are examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| Any of those, any of those, and maybe the text could read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| exceptions from the district regulations may be granted for plan developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| if the exceptions meet any of the following, including but not limited to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1310)|
| 0:22:04| I'd be good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Do you make note of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Actually, let's hear from the public first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Did you write down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I did, yes, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Kevin Murphy, representing the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| This is an interesting tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I certainly understand why we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| And it does have, there are some really good things that this will do, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| about getting us a little bit more flexibility to do some creative uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and allow us to see some amenities to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| We're pretty supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| We would urge you to consider a couple of tweaks on the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| The conceptual plan is currently optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and that's really a great opportunity to bring the neighbors in to help them understand what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| before you start the full train of preliminary plan approval that goes to here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| and then county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| The conceptual plan, it might be wise for that to be a required one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| The reason is that this is allowing you to exercise some pretty extraordinary powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| in terms of waiving use regulations as well as dimensional regulations and some other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| So I think if you get the conceptual plan, if that's actually required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| that gives you a public forum where you can make sure the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and the neighbors actually connect versus when they've put all that work into a full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| baked preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| The other item is around the final plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| We can certainly understand if it is pretty much exactly what was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| I can understand delegating that to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| If it was made where that was a public hearing in front of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| that would get staff out of the sticky situation of trying to decide what's a minor versus a major deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| That's something that I just thought of a few minutes ago, Chairman Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| and thought that that's something that could give you some value that keeps the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| from having to get into some politically charged fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| But we generally do support some of the things that this does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| and we do like the idea that this avoids sector plan and rezoning the underlying land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| so it really ties it to that specific plan that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Yes, sir, if you'll go ahead and write down your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| I'm Orlando Diaz with Partners Development, 502 Union Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| Just wanted to say that we're glad to see this come to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| We are very much in support of the ordinance as presented by Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| and would like to see this amendment passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| We think it's a great tool to work collaboratively with planning staff on complex projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| that may not fit neatly within a zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| First of all, I'd like to thank Gerald and the staff for all the work they've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| This is, I'll reiterate, I think it's a valuable tool to promote more creative development in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| and I think we really need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| I'd like to make a motion that we approve an amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| creating a plan development approval process known as the Plan Development Approval Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I'd just like to give you some information, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| I ran into Jennifer Roche an hour ago at an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| and she wanted me to convey to the Planning Commission that the Realtor Association was in favor of this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| and that they were very happy to see this go through today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| I have a question, just a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I like the idea of the concept plan being not voluntary but being required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Is that something that can be changed after you try this out for a little while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Could it be changed in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| The great thing about ordinances is they can be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| and we, to some extent, do that every month with our rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| We could at any time, initiated by staff, the commission, or the public, change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| We could watch it and even make a commitment from the staff now that in a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| we'll test this for a year, see how we need to tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| That should give adequate time for the development community, design community to use this tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| and for questions or issues that are identified during the process to, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| to find a way to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| What is the reasoning behind not requiring the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| I'm going to take the easy answer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Occasionally I'll try to use that technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| As I've stated before, this concept or idea came from the uptake to the city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| The process is in there, and I've made a commitment to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| to the county commissioners and staff and the public that what I saw as appropriate tools in that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| we try to apply to the county ordinance, and this was crafted by the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| And I'm not sure their intent or reasoning for making it optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| I think it was to allow an opportunity for what Mr. Murphy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| that early conversation among or between the community and the development team, but not mandate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| And for that I think the reasoning was that with a mandatory meeting with staff, pre-submittal meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| a planning commission review, county commission review, that there are plenty of opportunities for input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| and leaving some discretion to the development design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| to determine whether they felt that concept plan approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| should be a part of their process as they move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Again, picking up on what Commissioner Easton said, we can try it this way for a year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| and if we find that missing that conceptual plan review becomes a critical item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| we can make it mandatory at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I would like to ask, just to clarify, based on the chair's comment about the exceptions in section 6.80.04B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1737)|
| 0:29:10| if that wording is incorporated into your motion, Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and that would be that exceptions from district regulations may be granted for plan developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| If any of the exceptions listed below, including these exceptions but not limited to them, are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| I'll amend my motion to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I'll amend my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| So based on the amended motion, we do still have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1785)|

| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Next on the agenda is item number seven, subdivision report, concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| There will be three votes required on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1796)|

| 0:30:41| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one and two because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1849)|

| 0:31:32| We need to have some further discussion with Mr. Breschko and his staff on some minor issues affecting the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| and I'd like to just postpone it for 30 days if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I see no other lights on other than Mr. Clancy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1911)|

| 0:32:02| Next on the agenda is item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1922)|
| 0:32:18| The subdivision is Hardin Valley West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1938)|

| 0:32:53| There are four subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| The staff recommendation is to approve variances 1 through 4 because the site's topography, site features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| and location restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1984)|

| 0:33:14| And that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=1996)|

| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| My name is Dawn Walsh, and I'm on behalf of Hardin Valley Planning Advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| and here on behalf of the citizens living and working in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| We're in support of Hardin Valley West with the agreed-upon conditions with adding berms on the front lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| I think a conversation was had with Steve Bethel of Vertex to provide berming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| and a landscape plan to give further protection to the two lots that are right on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| And he also agreed to prep three common areas and green space for future recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| In addition, a pedestrian walkway connecting Laurel Ridge is to be prepped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| So that's all I have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Mr. Harbin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| Yes, David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Yes, the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And would you write that down, too, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Okay, sure, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Yes, they did have conversations with the owner, Mr. Bethel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| and he did agree to those conditions on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| So we're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| There's three conditions, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Yes, that's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| So it was a berm along the front lots that's along Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| He'll put a landscape berm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| He will prep the common area lots for once the builders come in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| then they can install some kind of amenity area there, whatever builder decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| alongside the pedestrian walkway through one of the common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Mr. Breschke, do you have any comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I guess on the last one with the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| was that on the road connection to the adjoining subdivision, or were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Because when you made that statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| it sounded like you said through the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Let me talk to Kim there and see what him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I was actually stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| and I think one of their advocates were the ones that were actually discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| and I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Ms. Walsh, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Because there is a sidewalk in the proposed street connection to Laurel Ridge subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| It's shown on the plan as ending at Laurel Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| but one of the conditions is that they have to tie that road into the main road within Laurel Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| to the standards as required by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| What we saw in an email is there will be a pedestrian connection from this property to Laurel Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| Not very specific, but that's all the specificity we have in the information provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2186)|
| 0:36:36| We had prepared to put the sidewalk in there for that pedestrian connection to Laurel Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| It's the most logical place for it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| I think if we go the other way, we will probably be coming into the back lots of something in Laurel Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| I think they were probably wanting that sidewalk along that stub road right there would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2209)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| I think condition number four pretty much takes care of the connectivity over to Laurel Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2226)|
| 0:37:17| It addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| I don't see any reason to include Birmingham as long as he's agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| It's approvable without it, but I think it's a great idea that he's working with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and stepping up and donating common area for playground or amenities or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| but I don't see that we need to include that in the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve variance one through four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| because the site's topography site features and location restrict compliance with subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| and proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2274)|

| 0:38:02| Commissioner Harbin, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2286)|

| 0:38:39| Next on the agenda is item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| This is a final plat and Grassy Creek resubdivision of lot 49,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| and I'm going to ask Mr. Breschke to speak to this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Thank you, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| We were recommending denial of this plat because we were lacking one of the design plan elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| that are required prior to final plat approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| We did receive a written request from the applicant yesterday to postpone this to the next planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| We did not have it in time to actually have it listed on the postponement list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| and the applicant wasn't here to add it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| But we do have a request from the applicant in writing to postpone it for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| The applicant is here, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| Sir, do you want to speak to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Motion postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Browning to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Next on the agenda is item number 24, under plan amendment rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| The applicant is Nader Mubarak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| The location is the northeast of Chapman Highway, northwest of East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| The tract information is .64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| Present plan designation and zoning is MDR-O, which is Medium Density Residential and Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| HP Hillside Protection, A, Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| The proposed plan designation and zoning is GC, General Commercial, HP Hillside Protection, CA, General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| The proposed use is any use allowed in CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| The staff recommendation is to adopt resolution 3A18SP, amending the South County sector plan to GC, General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2460)|
| 0:41:11| also to approve CA, General Business zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Sir, do you want to address the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I'd like to make a motion that we adopt resolution 3A18SP, amending the South County sector plan to GC, General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| slash HP Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| We have Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Sector plan on this, if you read on page 24-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2510)|
| 0:42:01| it says that they're considering .64 acres adjacent to a larger commercial A project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2521)|
| 0:42:19| This minor extension of GC could be considered a omission in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| for a small portion of the parcel that allows for commercial development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| This still allows for retention of the existing transitional land use designation of MDR slash O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| medium density and office, on the parcel between the commercial corridor and the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| What this really does is it brings the whole larger piece of commercial property that fronts up on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2570)|
| 0:43:02| into this person's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| There's no way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| You're talking about six-tenths of an acre, but that adjoins the larger piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| so really you're bringing the whole thing into his backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| You're not just dealing with six-tenths of an acre because that pulls it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2599)|
| 0:43:32| It says a minor extension of the existing CA zoning at this location would not negatively impact the adjacent RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| Well, it would negatively impact the RA when it goes right to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2621)|
| 0:43:51| Then if you come down to the middle here, this is where it lays out what's required to make this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2631)|
| 0:44:05| No new roads or additional utilities have been introduced into this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| so that's one that doesn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Another one, trends in development or population, and staff says there are no apparent new trends in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2653)|
| 0:44:22| so that one doesn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Then the third, a minor extension of GC on a small portion of parcel allows for commercial development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2664)|
| 0:44:33| The property is already allowed to be commercial, the part that's on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| while still protecting the existing transition land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| No, it doesn't protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| It infringes on it and takes it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| I don't see where there is any reasoning here that says that this should be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2693)|
| 0:45:04| Then over on 24.3, it says, number one, this minor extension, it's not a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2704)|
| 0:45:16| It brings the whole property in, and the proposed amendment shall be consistent with and not in conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| with the general plan of Knoxville and Knox County, including any of its elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| major road plan, land use plan, community facilities plan, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| One, the South Knox County sector plan proposes medium-density residential, which it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| and low-density residential uses for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| But amendment for general commercial for this extension has also been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| making this proposal consistent and not in conflict with any other adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| When you request something, it doesn't make it consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| It means you're asking to make it consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| That's totally false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I don't agree with what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| Respectfully disagree, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I tend to agree with staff's position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I don't think it does infringe on the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| and the fact that there is not anybody from the neighborhood here to object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| But if there was somebody to speak towards that, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| you know, this is going right in my backyard, what are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| They hadn't talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| They spoke on the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| I received calls on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| Commissioner Clancy, one thing I failed to ask you is to, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| to state one of the reasons for the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Because it's a minor extension of the GC on a small portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and allows for commercial development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| and still protects the existing transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I mean, we can approve and review what goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| I don't think that that comes back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| Would they do anything it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| No, it wouldn't come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| Yeah, that depends on what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Not with the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| With the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| I'd like to say one thing that I have a concern with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| in listening to Commissioner Graff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| and also reading the staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| is I'm looking at the original request from several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| and there was quite a larger piece of property that was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| And my concern is if we approve this sector plan amendment and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| then two years down the line it's like now we're doing another minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| And so it concerns me about having the creep of the scale of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| So that's a little concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Yeah, I was just going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I'm more concerned just about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I'd like to ask in a minute why CA would be preferred over a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| or if there's any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I mean, I wouldn't mind if there was some review of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| so that we could ensure that the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| and some kind of buffering remains to the residential section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| then I think it would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| Just to give the CA with no further review or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| I'm not sure I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| Two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| One is maybe not as good as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| The first is that's the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| and we typically present that as the first option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Second is that the property of which this is a portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| it's currently zoned CA, so we're just continuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| If you look at the map up there, see where the cursor is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| That's all CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| The PC is the purple that's in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| so it's not connected to a planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| And having this small portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| the six-tenths of an acre of one parcel planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| would be challenging for review when the rest of it is CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| I guess what I'm saying is since the same owner owns all of this pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| it would make sense to do it all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| And we can't, because it wasn't all advertised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| we can't rezone the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| A way to address your concern is even though the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| let me give you two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| One is to place a condition that no additional grading be permitted on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| There's a portion that's already graded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| and that would preserve the wooded area on the northeast side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| adjacent to what's remaining residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Another, even though sometimes the city law department frowns on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| this is a county and they haven't made a real big issue yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| is to make a condition that any development of this property be of use for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| and come back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And the reason the sector plan justification is an omission in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| is that what I'm to understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And that this is a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| I may let, if Liz wants to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I would say the sector plans tend to be drawn along the zoning line boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| In this case, there was, you know, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| arbitrarily a zoning line drawn down Chapman Highway of 200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| to accommodate commercial development down Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| It wasn't drawn specifically to topography or to property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| So, you know, in staff's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| this is a minor extension of both the zone that's being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| because it is adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| And the small area that they're requesting is following the topography line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| that steep slope area that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And it's the same for the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| If we were to redraw the sector plan amendment boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| it would follow that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| This is not a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| You're bringing the whole parcel of CA in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| It becomes one parcel then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| So this part might only be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| If the rest of it was something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| and we were talking about six-tenths of an acre, that might be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| But we're talking about, I don't know how big that is, a couple acres, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| We're only changing that small portion, I think, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| When you change it, you bring it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Mr. Harbin, I know you have a comment, and we also had someone else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| I'm here reluctantly representing the applicant in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| so I'd like to make just a few comments on this if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Yes, it is just six-tenths of an acre right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| What has necessitated this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I've been doing this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Planning Commission, back in days long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| as long as your building was situated in the CA portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| you were permitted to do what you wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| However, in order to develop this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I also have to have some parking or something in that flat spot behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| The leadership of Planning Commission now has told me that if any portion of this site is in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| it all must be then to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| I couldn't put a parking lot in the agricultural portion to support the CA portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| It's happened on another project that I asked for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| So that's why we're before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| So we're going to put the building up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| but we may need some parking or something like that to support the commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| There is a good bank up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| It's 10, 20 feet that will provide separation from the residential behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| We're not going to grade into that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| The landscape is going to stay in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| But in order to develop this site under the current NPC guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| we have to fit everything within that 20-foot section, even so it's graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| So the interpretation of how the zoning is laid out necessitated this request for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| So all I want to do is build something in the CA zone up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| and then probably have parking or something what's in the agricultural portion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| The planned commercial zone won't work here because they have 50-foot side setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| peripheral setbacks that would eat up the entire land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| It's such a small land anyway, so I can't really go PC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| CA would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| That was the only reason why we came before you to ask for the CA zone change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| And just to confirm what Mr. Harbin said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| the property is split-zoned, as this one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| portion commercial and portion residential agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| We cannot put commercial buildings or parking to support the commercial building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| and activity on the residential or agriculturally zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| So we cannot develop the rear portion of this property for commercial purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| even though the front portion is zoned commercial because of the zoning difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| We have a couple of commission lights on, but I'd like to hear from, ma'am, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| Corinne Rivetti, 6925 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| So I'm in the general area that we're discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Commissioner Clay and Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| I think this is where we come into what we call the slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| You know, we have an area that's on a residential area, and when does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| We have other projects in this general area that will be before this commission before long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| and it also addresses the same concerns when you have residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| and we're asking for sector plan changes that affect communities, affect residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| and we keep saying, oh, this is just a small section, but that's the slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| because the next time it's another small section, and after that it's another small section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| And before you know, we've just kind of overrode what our sector plans are there to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| First of all, let me address the slippery slope, and with respect to Commissioner Graf's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3354)|
| 0:56:06| we are moving commercial further in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| It's already planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| If anything, we're pushing into a planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| We're pushing more into the planned commercial than we are the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| It's planned commercial behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| What's the purple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| It is planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Is that planned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| It's planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| It's going that way, but it's planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Yes, commercial is going down John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| It's planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| We do review that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I'm almost positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| So that's a good transition and helps to buffer into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| The topography is going to separate the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| And let me just say that we can go ahead and we can amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3416)|
| 0:57:04| and if I can put in my motion a condition that whatever development goes on there has to come before us and be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3424)|
| 0:57:18| I think that would help us get any kind of vegetative barriers that would even help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3438)|
| 0:57:27| So that's slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I think it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| I think you've got what you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| As Liz said, there's a 200-foot swath down there that before we ever got here was decided was going to be GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3455)|
| 0:57:46| So that's just what I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| I'm going to call on our attorney with regards to any kind of conditioning to get this open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Condition was only is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| The city in particular and the county also at some level has taken the position that you can't condition uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| but the staff can make recommendations to you based upon the type of conditions that can be imposed upon the application of a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| You've done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| You've applied conditions that would otherwise arise from a more restrictive zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| One of the patterns that you've used in the past is to require use of review on zones that otherwise wouldn't require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| That's fairly normal, and the city has approved that and the county has as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| So you have to stay away from in order to satisfy the city, not in order to satisfy me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I think you've got pretty much carte blanche on conditionals only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| but the city's position is that you need to stay away from conditioning uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| Otherwise, you've got pretty good latitude and staff can guide you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| If you tell staff what they want, they can guide you on what would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| And my intention was not to condition the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| My position is to bring a review forward that we can ensure a barrier between the neighborhood of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3536)|
| 0:59:07| And that would go on the second part, which is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| It already says clearing and grading of steep slopes adjacent to residential property should be avoided to prevent further erosion of the embankment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| Should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| We can say, okay, we want a review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| We'll see if they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| We'll say, okay, if you're going to cut here, you're going to landscape here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| We want a class B landscaping plan to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| And there's no denying that the CA is less restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3570)|
| 0:59:38| But with a condition, I think we can make this a useful piece of property that's not going to be detrimental to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| the two lots behind it, one lot behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| I think what I was going to say overlaps with Commissioner Clancy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| I was going to suggest that when we get to the second approval that we strengthen that one condition so that it says that you shall not grade or clear in the steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3596)|
| 1:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| They're saying it should be avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I just want to say that I agree with Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I don't think it's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| We're talking about approximately a half an acre and the topography, and I think the additional buffer required when it abuts that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3618)|
| 1:00:27| Is this abutting the residential there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| There is additional buffer required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Not under the county code and not under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| I think that may be tied in with the condition that Mr. Clancy or Commissioner Clancy and Commissioner Eason referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3637)|
| 1:00:45| that limit the grading, additional grading, preserve the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| And when we get there, we can work it a bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Give me a little time to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| But no additional grading or limit the additional grading and preserve the existing buffer along the boundary with the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3653)|
| 1:01:04| It would be nice to see that additional buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| But I think what they're expanding there is actually to have a use of the parking to support already the commercial use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3666)|
| 1:01:16| It's a small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Nobody is objecting, and I just think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| Call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| This is voting on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Roth to adopt the amendment to the South County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3692)|
| 1:01:42| Commissioner Hill, do you still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3705)|

| 1:02:47| Those two conditions are that clearing and grading of the steep slopes adjacent to the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| shall be avoided to prevent further erosion of the embankment and condition number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3774)|
| 1:03:04| that any development on the property requires a review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Knoxville Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| To approve CA business zoning subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| I do not see any other light zone other than Commissioner Clancy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Same noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I voted aye, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Okay, so the motion still carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| We are on to agenda item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| This is rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| The applicant is Ralph Smith, slash PLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| The location is the east side of Kate Road, north, south, and east of Gina Way at the intersection of Caitlin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| Approximate size of the tract is 8.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| The present zoning is A, agricultural, and RA, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| The zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| The proposed use is duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| The density proposed is four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| Staff recommendation is to approve PR planned residential zoning for up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Sir, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3902)|
| 1:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3917)|
| 1:05:27| Good afternoon, plan commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| If you could also state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Because we would like to know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Yes, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Jason Kiernan, 6112 Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Actually, just a little ways north of the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I'm here actually on behalf of a majority faction of the neighbors in the immediate vicinity of the suggested rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3945)|
| 1:05:55| I did send an email to the commission last Friday afternoon with regard to our concerns with regard to the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| and subsequent duplex developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Just to reiterate, the rezoning change and the duplex development isn't really, at least the way we feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3967)|
| 1:06:16| congruent with the majority of housing in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| So if we call it up on the map, a lot of the homeowners have single family residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3981)|
| 1:06:30| Some of the homes are on quite large, actually on the same side of the street, quite large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| One of our neighbors has horses and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| We have agricultural zoning already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| So the feeling within the neighborhood is that duplex development isn't congruent with the majority of residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| that's on Kate Road right now between Emory and the Anderson County border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| Our second concern is with regard to traffic and traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Traffic safety and volume, I had learned, is calculated through an algorithm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| We're not familiar with how this algorithm is calculated, but we're concerned since Kate Road extends north into Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| that perhaps the volume of traffic is incorrectly calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| In addition to that, on Kate Road just south of Emory, there's a brand new development through Smith Builds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4037)|
| 1:07:27| that is not yet completed, which will already itself, once upon completion, add more traffic to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| what we consider to be an existing dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| We're concerned that adding duplexes will add more problems to what we've already experienced as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| Then our last concern is just none of the neighbors within my vicinity received any communication that we're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4065)|
| 1:07:54| from the developer or representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| So we were actually quite surprised and taken aback by this sudden appearance of a rezoning sign over the course of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| As we've come to be aware, the Planning Commission does encourage developers to work with neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| to encourage development that's congruent, consistent, and to the satisfaction of all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| So we would encourage the Commission to consider rejecting this rezoning aligned with the wishes of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Mr. Carradine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Mr. Carradine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Carradine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| I just had one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| You were talking about a developer reaching out to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Do you have an established neighborhood in your area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| No, we don't have anything formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I know there was someone here from a Hardin Valley development advocacy group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| We don't have anything that formal established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Okay, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Just parties, hot dogs, and hamburgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Ralph Smith, 205 Lamar Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| I'm representing the developer, Dwight Disney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| We're just requesting a rezoning that is compatible with what's going on in the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| There's PR 1 to 5 across the road right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| There's nothing inconsistent about the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| We certainly have a lot of engineering and design stuff we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| We're going to wind up with an awful lot of open space in that because the south end of our property right there is closed contour, sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| something that we've got to work with Knox County Engineering on as far as our stormwater goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| So our use of the property is fairly limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| We'll probably wind up being able to utilize half of it maybe for actual buildings and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| but I don't think our rezoning request is anything unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I mean, we still have to do a concept plan and everything here, so I'm not sure what else to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Knox County Engineering, would you like to comment at all on the traffic on that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| He mentioned the – not the applicant, but the other fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| He mentioned the issue down there at Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| As part of that development, TDOT required them to do a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| That traffic study outlined that there would need to be a left turn lane added on Emery Road into that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| As part of that, the county decided to actually partner with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and actually expand the scope of that project a little bit to include a left turn lane northbound on the Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| Not this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| As the development to the south, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| We decided to partner with them to provide us that added benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| And as far as the traffic counts go, as part of that traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| we had to actually go out and physically count cars on all of the approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| There's no real smoke and mirrors to the numbers that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| They're actually counting vehicles for the specified periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| It's good to hear that there is some improvements being made there at Emery Road and Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4280)|
| 1:11:29| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Thanks for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| I appreciate what you say about your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| But part of the problem is, as Mr. Smith said, the zoning is well within what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| We're not allowed to discriminate against housing types, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| It's bad for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| That being said, the more it gets to where Knoxville is a beautiful place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| we've got to find a place to put more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I'm confused, and I don't know how it works, but I'm sure there's a good calculation for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| We've got 33 dwelling units going on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| They're going to be duplexes, and we only have two student yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| I'm going to try to explain this based on the information I've gotten from my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| The student yield is based on school sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| and the typical number of students coming from a dwelling in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| It varies by dwelling type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| A single-family home is calculated to produce more students than a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| a duplex more than an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Beyond that, we continually hear the same comment you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| and I go back to our staff who run those statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| and they confirm that based on existing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| that's the numbers of students who result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| That surprises me, but I trust your accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| To be quite honest, that surprises me, but I see the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| and I know that buyers figure and figures lie, but we've got the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| A money smarter than I am came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| It seemed odd that 33 dwelling units, especially duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| which would mean starter families and people with young kids, would yield less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4418)|
| 1:13:46| But I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Did I say 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| So glad you guys were listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| We'd have four students then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| I just wanted to get some kids in school, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| and a second by Commissioner Rock to approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| And, Mr. Caron, I did want to make mention the zoning requested is planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| and what that means is there's going to be another hearing on what he's come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| what his idea is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So you'll have an opportunity to see how this works within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| I would encourage Mr. Smith to work with you and your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| to at least identify your concerns with regard to buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| and transitioning from the duplexes to the single-family homes and how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| I'm a strong believer in needing a variety of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| to also understand the concern about compatibility with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| and maybe design of those homes that he may be able to work with you to match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| even though they may be duplexes, to match the character of the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| And it's a good opportunity to have another neighborhood meeting with hot dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| and invite Mr. Smith to come and meet the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| Okay, I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4521)|

| 1:21:29| In the area that's undeveloped, just to the south there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| there's actually a multifamily development that's been proposed for that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| and is part of an approved concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| So the density that they're asking for is in keeping with what is adjacent or in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4899)|
| 1:21:48| Well, I think everyone's pretty familiar that we have a really intense growth happening out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| and school overcrowding, and so the one that's just across the street from there, we just missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| You know, we're trying to keep an eye on everything that's going on, and we missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| And so I guess what we're asking you all to do is to be looking out for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| knowing what our issues are, and maybe making a different recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| So we're going to ask for three or less for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| We'd ask that you'd consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Thank you, and Kevin Murphy, just to point out that if this is rezoned and goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4943)|
| 1:22:30| there's a significant intersection challenge there with Yarnell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| and that's already a problematic, dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| So it seems like the rezoning might be a little preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| because then you rezone a lot for that use, but there's not an obvious way for it to actually line up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| and have the correct access that it should to that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| It seems like this might be a little bit premature unless they actually had the adjacent lot as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| where they could actually get that line up with Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| So it's a warning of caution that the rezoning will then precipitate a series of challenging design events later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| unless something else is also included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Would the applicant like to make some comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| I believe you probably do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| Yes, Garrett Tucker, Robert Campbell, Associates 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| We've been working with the applicant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| We're doing some preliminary layouts and talking to the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| The intersection from this, of course, it was platted a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| and we will need a variance for the spacing from Yarnell Road to this entrance to reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| I think it's about 180 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| We have good sight distance looking past Yarnell to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| Looking to the west around that curve, we didn't have enough sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| so we are talking to the adjoining landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| He is very agreeable to allow that bank to be graded down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| We're going to hopefully redo his driveway and just kind of trade off with him and get that sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| but it's kind of a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| His driveway actually comes out, and he has an easement to use this same entrance for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| so that will kind of solve that problem for him and then also for this future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| The planned use is some apartments at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| We're looking at 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I mean, the property is large enough that you could fit way more than that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| but we think the five units per acre is very reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| so we would just ask for approval of the five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Yeah, as far as the sector plan change goes, I can definitely see where it's warranted in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| It's my understanding, I don't know if anybody can confirm this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| about sewer and water has been extended down into this area to accommodate the new development across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| but it's my understanding that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| I don't know if anybody else is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Knox County Engineering, Schicking, you said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| I have no knowledge of that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Actually, West Knox Utility District is extending a six-inch force main,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| and they're going to cross this neighbor as well around that curb with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| so that should meet, and there's a pump station being put in as part of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I was just going to also say that West Knox Utility District is in the process of completing a new wastewater treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| that will be within 2,000 feet from here, just north of that quarrying area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5156)|
| 1:26:06| So in terms of the sector plan change, I definitely can see that being justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| and the density to me is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| It's close to Watt Road exit, which should alleviate growth in that area from being on Hardin Valley in the Pellissippi area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| I'll make a motion that we adopt Resolution 8A19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| And your reasoning for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| Due to changes in the area and extension of sewer in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Clancy, but Commissioner Clancy, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| Liz, I've got a question for Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| Liz, the property, you said that we approved a concept plan that's right next to this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| But it's not the same developers, it's not the same owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| but is there a chance that both developments could use shared access directly across from Yarnell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5231)|
| 1:27:20| and not have dispersed access along Everett Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5240)|
| 1:27:28| So I will say it's not immediately adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| There's a small sliver of agricultural zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| You can see, I think, actually two adjacent parcels next to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| It's that large vacant triangle piece along Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Just trying to look broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| I thought that that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Okay, we do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| a second by Commissioner Clancy to adopt the resolution to amend the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5273)|
| 1:28:01| I see no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5285)|

| 1:28:09| I can make a motion that we approve planned residential zone at less than five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5289)|

| 1:28:20| And up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| to approve the PR planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5316)|

| 1:29:01| The location, these two parcels are situated between Old Tazewell Pike and Hyatt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5341)|

| 1:29:33| Present plan designation zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| The proposed plan designation zoning is RR, rural residential, PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5379)|
| 1:29:48| The existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5388)|

| 1:30:06| But then we have the density proposed is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| This requires two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| One vote would be to adopt resolution amending the northeast county sector plan to RR, rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5413)|

| 1:30:32| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Sir, the opposition, the applicant would like you to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| He has the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| Jeffrey Johnson, 5817 Old Tazewell Pike, right across from this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| I want to wear the total acreage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| It's a little larger than I thought, but still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| This is the old Corum subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| I'm not sure what its original charter was as far as density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| The upper area on Old Tazewell Pike is a quickly sloping property running down to Hyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5470)|
| 1:31:19| It takes a lot of water, rainwater runoff, especially with heavy rains like we've had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| There's a deep drainage ravine that is at the back of this property as it runs between the two roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| and it gets a lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| It drains, actually, the culvert is right in front of my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| so I've got a good view of it running down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| I'm concerned about what grading for, there's an existing home on the Hyatt Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| I'm not sure what the plan is for it, but I think the other is to build two on the other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| So I'm concerned about the grading and what it will do to the water runoff if that ravine is filled in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| or if the whole hillside just erodes into the ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| I think we can answer some of your questions, or we can at least get them answered for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5530)|
| 1:32:19| Randy Gennard, 5408 Fountain Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| This piece of property is 2.54 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| It was two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| We have resurveyed, moved the property line on the lower lot to include the existing Hyatt Road house on one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| which leaves us about three-quarters of an acre on both the other sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| There's proposed to be two new homes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| We have Knox County Health Department-approved septic plans already for both residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| and the existing house already has a septic plan for it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| So there will be no grading in the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Ms. Portier, could you address any of the concerns with regards to the stream running through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5581)|
| 1:33:08| I think you had some information that you presented at gender review that was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5588)|
| 1:33:19| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| I didn't have any information on the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| The main things I was talking about was the density and the lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| so I would have to ask Knox County for information on stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| We're not aware of any stream on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| It's not a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| It's a storm rainwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Okay, I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| So it's just you're concerned about the rainwater during the heavy rains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| The amount of water that comes down through there in heavy rains is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| The only thing I would say to that is there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| he's adding two houses instead of the one that would ordinarily go on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| so there shouldn't be a lot of impervious surface added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| So I don't anticipate that that would be a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| But, again, that's not my area of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| so I would, again, defer to the county to see their opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| or if they want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Yeah, so if our ordinance says above 10,000 square feet of impervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| that's when they have to start worrying about stormwater controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| But our stormwater ordinance does protect against that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we adopt Resolution No. 8B19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| amending the Northeast County Sector Plan to RR Rural Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| and adopt a Sector Plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And that is based on that this area is developed with a density that coincides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| with that of the applicant's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| So, okay, I'm just, again, Sector Plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| What is our justification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Commissioner Clancy, could you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| The area is developed with a density that coincides with that of the applicant's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| The whole area has, he's not creating a huge difference in density here that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5722)|
| 1:35:35| We've got two houses going in on the lot on Old Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| If you look back at the topography, I don't think that's prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I know it seems like we're doing a lot of Sector Plan changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| but we're dealing with limited land here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| and we've got to figure out how to make good use of it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| There's no sewer out there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| And that surprises me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| That's why I looked at the topography, because if, like Mr. Johnson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| that it's really steep and there's ravines and there's stormwater running through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| I was wondering how he would get a set drain field in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| but if you look at the topography maps, it looks like he can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| I don't mean to make a big deal, but, like, there's 74 acres at the end of Hyatt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| and if that person comes in in two months and wants a Sector Plan change, are we going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| It depends on what they're going to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| I mean, a Sector Plan change is kind of a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| I mean, we're supposed to treat it as a big deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| and supposed to have easily justifiable reasons for doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| and I just want to make sure we take that seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| because staying consistent with how we do it, it could come back in a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| and we might have a hard time explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| And I saw the big piece up at the end of Hyatt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| I understand what you're saying, but, I mean, we're not granting four units to the acre or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5837)|
| 1:37:26| It seemed to me justifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I'd like to hear from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| Ms. Portier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Yes, originally when we were looking at this, a lot of the lots across the street are noncompliant with the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| So when the Sector Plan comes for review in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| this would be an area that we would look at to see if we would change that designation from agricultural to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5862)|
| 1:37:50| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Just due to the lot size to bring those into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| Right now, the homes, the lot sizes range from half acre to one and three quarter acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| The density ranges from 0.82 to 1.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| So we feel like this is in line with how the development has occurred here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| and this would probably be something that would be amended in the future anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| Based on what it is right now, he wanted to do two units per acre is what the goal is for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| That's what he requested, but the way that the actual math shakes out, it's 1.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| He's got 0.8 acres for one lot, I believe, and 0.9 for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| It's like he can do two houses now, and he'll have three houses if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Well, the Hyatt Roadhouse remains as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| So he really would just be creating two lots out of the one on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| He brought it before us both because he was pushing that lot line back between the two and replatting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5924)|

| 1:38:56| This property is entirely within the hillside protection area, as I'm looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| That's a bit of a concern for me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| This is planned residential, so this will come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Well, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| It only comes back to you if it is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| It wouldn't come back to you if it's RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| I'm opposed to the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Planned residential will come back to you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| If he rezones to PR, then, yes, it would come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| It's staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| That would be the second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| I'm concerned about the amount of clearing and grading that might happen in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| So that's something I'll be looking for when it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| Yes, Mr. Scannard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| There should be a layout in the packet that shows both the houses and type of them and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| And that will have to come back to the commission on a separate review as planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Scott touched on it just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| Keep in mind with this parcel, what we're doing here, what he's asking for is one additional house on the acreage, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| He could have two now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| And by increasing this, we're going from an acre lot to .8 or .9 acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| As Ms. Portier said, this matches the development pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| And going back to another question that Commissioner Smith had about the property down at the end of Hyatt Road, we'd review that separately, the topo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6032)|
| 1:40:41| There appears to be more topographical challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| So we'd cross that bridge when we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| And it has to stand on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| If that property comes up to us sometime in the future, it would have to stand on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| So I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| I think this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6059)|

| 1:43:42| This is a very difficult piece of property, one that should have remained agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| Apparently, it's been rezoned several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| But we're here now with plans residential in a difficult area with a difficult piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6231)|

| 1:44:52| Commission has increased the number of houses from two to three houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| I would encourage commission to retain the three houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| Conditions do not warrant, conditions in Hardin Valley do not warrant the increase to 4.8 houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6305)|
| 1:45:17| The traffic problem has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| The elementary school, which is right directly across Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6321)|

| 1:45:54| It is still there, very steep and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| So I certainly would encourage commission to retain the three houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6359)|

| 1:46:38| The first one recommended 4.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6398)|

| 1:47:21| Okay, yeah, and to answer Mr. Valiant's point, in I think it was October of 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6441)|
| 1:47:30| the property was graded without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| There was some stumps being removed, and I think it was Mr. Biddle's idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| that the clearing could include removal of the stumps without a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| That obviously violates our ordinance, so we had spoke with Mr. Biddle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| and he did subsequently provide a grading plan for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| and has got the property back in compliance with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| as well as paid a civil penalty for that grading without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| So at this point in time, from the perspective of the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| Mr. Biddle is in compliance with our ordinances and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| for the property of the Steel Crossing subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Did you review the development plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Yes, we have reviewed the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| They appear to be consistent with our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| We haven't actually approved them yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| but they do appear to be consistent with the standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Now, when I compared these two zoning reports, and I've done this for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6516)|
| 1:48:46| I've never seen one report followed by another report with a different result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| but the same comments backing up both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| In the first report, it states that the proposed amendment shall be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| because of substantially changed or changing conditions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| and the districts affected or in the city and county generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| It also said the proposed amendment shall be consistent with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| and purpose of the applicable zoning ordinance, and it went on to say how it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| It said the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| It met all three of those requirements without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| In addition to that, this is a unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| I heard Mr. Green speak earlier about the way they're going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| considering, I think, planned residential developments or developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| This development, we're putting in cobblestone streets or paver streets instead of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| We're giving 20 acres to Legacy Parks to put trails in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| This isn't exactly a poor development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| The only difference between what we're asking you to approve today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| and what was approved before is up at the top of the development, there's two cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| and we're putting units on those cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| It's the same exact footprint, no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6624)|
| 1:50:36| The genesis of this request was I was talking to somebody with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| and they were talking about the need for higher density in some of these projects in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6642)|
| 1:50:50| And the reason is you put more units on smaller lots or on smaller acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6650)|
| 1:51:00| that you won't use up as much acreage when it develops out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| And so that's why we came back and asked for 4.8 instead of the three that we already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| There's no reason stated in the staff report, the rezoning report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6671)|
| 1:51:18| that indicates that this should be anything other than what we requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| Ms. Albertson, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I'll speak to a bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| The initial staff report did say up to 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| That was primarily due to the proximity of this development to commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| and to the school trying to find those places for appropriate locations for higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| Staff is staff to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| There was a good bit of discussion at Tuesday's agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| Staff received the opinion and direction from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| As a result, revised the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| We do that fairly often based on the conversation at the agenda review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| We did that in this case, again, following the direction of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| We are staff to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| We understand the concerns that were expressed by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| accepted those concerns, and revised the staff report based on that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| We continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| I would agree with Mr. Valiant that this may be a location for the plan development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| so that the planning commission can review the attributes that Mr. Valiant mentioned as part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| as part of the initial review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| One of the weaknesses of the process that we have now is that you rezone and then you see the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6767)|
| 1:52:55| You've already, in many ways, over three-quarters of the way down the road by the time you get to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| which makes it challenging for this commission, for the staff, and for the developer or applicant for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| That's trying to address those questions and those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6789)|
| 1:53:19| You did a great job with that, addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Mr. Valiant, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| We have Mr. Biddle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Also, we have our engineer here if anybody has any questions of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| We brought everybody here that might need to answer any questions that anybody might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| We're going to take this to commission now and with Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| First, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| I think somebody made a comment Tuesday about when the CA was graded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6828)|
| 1:53:56| some of the grading was already done on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| Did that actually happen or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| When the CA was created on the front house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Yeah, when they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| I'm not aware of the date when the CA zoning occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| If we could turn on all NPC cases and see when that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6852)|
| 1:54:21| If you look at the aerial, you can see that the CA grading started sometime around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| I believe, 2010 or before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| Then the back half seemed to have been cleared around 2013, 2016-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6873)|
| 1:54:42| Yeah, I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| There was a lady there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Could you repeat the question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| It was to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| I asked if somebody had made a comment that when the CA was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| some of the grading on this property was done when that CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| That looks a little bit more intrusive than stunt pulling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| but I was just trying to get a feel for did they just blatantly go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| and start cutting without a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| or was some of the grading done when that CA was put in on that front side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| That's what's confusing about this particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| because what's in front of us, I guess, today is the steel crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| and the front is called, it's got a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| So the bulk of the mass grading that I think is in question, to my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| was on those front commercial zone lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| and the back portion was primarily what you would consider minor grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| in the sense of removing stumps and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| So that would be my interpretation is the mass grading occurred on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| that is not an issue in front of this body now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| It's the area in the back that was primarily removing the stumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| When the CA was put in, was this piece of property used to fill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| I mean, is that why most of this looks like it's been cut and cleared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| Not to my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| From my recollection, it was not that material was being taken from the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| and put on the back or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| I don't believe that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| I don't believe any significant material moved from one place to the other on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| That's a question that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| When you look at an aerial that looks like that, you start to wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| and somebody had brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| And also, on Tuesday, I was the one who brought up 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| I just didn't see how we got from 2.12 to 4.5 in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7014)|
| 1:57:05| I think three is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Normally, I would say a higher density on challenging pieces makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| so that the development gives an opportunity for the developer to do more creative stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| This is a tough piece, and I think staff struggled with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7041)|
| 1:57:29| I think they got it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| so I'm going to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| subject to three conditions, and those conditions are no additional land-disturbing activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| until a revised use-on-review and concept plan application is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| by the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| and proper permits are obtained from Knox County Engineering, which it seems like they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| and an updated traffic study must be submitted to reflect the increased density requested by the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| with the forthcoming use-on-review concept plan application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Sidewalks must be provided on both sides of the internal street network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| as the property is directly across the street from Hardin Valley Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| A motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Commissioner Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| This whole piece of property is in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| and I would say that if there are stumps, then trees were cut to create the stumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| and I could consider that disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| And if we look at the percentages of slopes, we have 11 acres that used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| I don't know if it still is, greater than 25% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| and another 10 acres that was greater than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| So that should not have disturbed more than 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| So that disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Yes, I'm kind of having a hard time with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| And I want to make sure I understand correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| So this developer at one time, or he does today, he had zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| The concept plan was approved, and staff approved up to 4.5 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7146)|
| 1:59:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| 2.98 concept plan in May of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| The staff recommended, as of this past Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| they recommended up to 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| That was before agenda review, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| And then at agenda review, the two negatives were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| there had been some grading without a permit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| but it sounds like it was stump removal and he paid a civil fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| and we talked about a challenging site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| I mean, is it up to this body to just interpret the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| or are we making decisions on, you know, how challenging the site is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| You know, I mean, this is a creative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| It sounds like he's donating 20 acres to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| which means there's a conservation easement in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| You know, there's cobblestone streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| and Hardin Valley certainly needs the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| I mean, are we bringing it from or are we changing our minds because of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| you know, the grading without a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| and us deciding it's a challenging site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| I'll answer your two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Yes, it is up to this commission to interpret the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| and determine how to apply it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| and also to determine the challenges of a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| and how that should impact your zoning recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| And I actually have a question for Mr. Valiant, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| You mentioned Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Do you have the initial letter from Legacy Parks where they've agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| We didn't bring it today yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| We've been dedicated to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| And I think we told it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| To make this clear, he had a valid grading permit when he was grading on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| Don't get the idea he did not have a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| What they're saying he didn't have the right to do was clean up the stumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| Mr. Snowden here can testify that he had a valid grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| So that's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| I have a question for Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| In 2017, in looking at the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| the hillside ridgetop protection calculations were utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| and at that point it was determined that permissible up to 2.12 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7299)|
| 2:01:47| based on the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| But those base calculations based on ridgetop hillside are not at the same as what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7311)|
| 2:01:59| So that would indicate to me that there has been significant grading on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| not just stump removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| We messaged Knox County Engineering about this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| I mean, just from looking at the aerial, you could tell that the site had been extremely disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| So we asked if there had been any sort of submitted grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| that we could then look at what the topography looks like today out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| versus what it looked like in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| And we weren't able to obtain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| As Mr. Snowden said, there has been a plan submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| but it has not been approved yet showing that grading or the clearing that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| So we felt like we didn't have any new information to go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| but they were asking for an increase in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| And this body actually denied the rezoning back in 2017 and the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7372)|
| 2:03:03| Then it went on to county commission and was approved up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| I think Mr. Snowden can back this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| There's never been any grading on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Any grading on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| Both properties, the one still crossing and the one in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| I can't remember the name of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| both properties have in the past had active Knox County grading permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| So I did want to get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| I think there's been some misconception about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| So both those properties during some point in the time have had active grading permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| that have been approved by our office and bonded for grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| If before you would take a vote on what Commissioner Clancy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7435)|
| 2:04:07| we would rather withdraw our request because we've gone way far down the road on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7447)|
| 2:04:16| deny it, I guess, just deny everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| We cannot live with your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| We can't live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| Madam Chair, there's a motion on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| And we will vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| But it was an approved concept plan in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| Get up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Rusty Biddle, I'm the owner, 10784 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| We already have three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| We already have an approved concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| We already have pretty much complete engineering approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| We don't want to start the process over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| If you vote, that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| If I have to stop, we will be grading dirt on the site probably next week as soon as we get our grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| So we don't want to start going through a concept plan again for one we already have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| We would rather be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| I see that point, which is why when I see that you have an approved concept plan of 2.9 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7519)|
| 2:05:26| and we're here saying, okay, three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| We didn't ask for 4.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| They recommended 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| They changed the sheet yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| We were unaware of that, so we didn't know that we were going to be recommended for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| We didn't ask for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| We already have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| You got 2.98, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| We don't want three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| We're good with 2.98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| We don't want .02 acres to start the process over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| We are way too far along on engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| I'm confused as to why you would need to restart the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| Because you're changing the zoning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| I'll defer to Mr. Wise, but I think it may be appropriate to withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| I can withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| I understand, Mr. Biddle, what Mr. Biddle is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| I was confused as to why it came in again when it was 2.98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| I understand we changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| It's been changed since Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| I think this is the appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| I don't know that you're going to get any different, but I understand not going through the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| I get that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| I think we got it right in May of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| That's the question I had Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| How did we go from 2.98 acres in May to 4.5 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7604)|
| 2:06:51| That's what I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| Commissioner Phillips, you also withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Madam Chair, I believe Mr. Hubbard wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| He was standing up in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Did you want to say something, Mr. Hubbard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| Don Hubbard, 2128 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| All I was going to say, that's when you were discussing the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| The property was clear cut, and it was graded off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| You could plant corn on the hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| We had a gully washer to block it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| So it was thoroughly worked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| Do we have to make a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| We just would deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| Right, but Commissioner Roth, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| Mr. Biddle, I'm sitting here thinking, okay, you've already got a plan approved at 2.98 or 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| and ready to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| What was the reason of requesting additional use per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| So the plan we have approved, the concept plan, and if full engineering is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| we can get the higher density on the same plan without any changes whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| So we're trying to put higher density on the same piece of graded property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| So our plans that are approved that are probably a couple of days from getting our grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| would allow us to put these additional units without any other disturbance whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| And on the record, I have never graded on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| I did stump it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| I was penalized for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| I've had a grading permit since 2012 on the front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| I think we've all established that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| That dirt was all hauled off to other sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| It wasn't placed on my site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| It was all hauled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| Okay, we have nothing on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| a second by Commissioner Phillips to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| To deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| To deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| To deny the request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| So it will stay just as it is with the 2.98 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| Okay, so we just voted, and the motion carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7780)|
| 2:09:50| Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| In all the emails that we've received on this in the last two or three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| predominantly it was traffic and the school across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| and how that was going to impact everything, and it was so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| The reason I didn't say this during the discussion is because traffic wasn't brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| It wasn't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| But in just about every email, it was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| I was down there Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| One of the emails recommended you be there between 5 and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| There was no backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| It was busy, but, you know, you made it through the traffic lights on one try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| So then I thought, well, maybe it's the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| So I went down there yesterday, and I was there from 2.30 until 3.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7841)|
| 2:10:53| And the traffic at the school is self-inflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7853)|
| 2:11:01| meaning that it's all the cars coming to pick up their kids that caused the traffic jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| If they rode a school bus, there wouldn't be a problem, and Knox County provides them free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7868)|
| 2:11:16| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| Mr. Foster, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Madam Chair, I'd like to, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| I'd like to make a comment on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| We just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| I think, you know, we just approved the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| We're going to send that to commission, hopefully, to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| Plan growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| Plan growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| And from what they were describing with the cobblestone streets and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| and that kind of thing and the donating the property to better the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| it sounds, this would sound like that would fit that program very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| And a concept plan that was brought in with a team of, you know, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| that's doing something different, maybe a higher density would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| But we aren't looking at that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| We can't do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| It's got a concept plan that was approved in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| And Ms. Wills, if you have something very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Yeah, really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| I just, in regards to the school traffic, you're correct, Commissioner, that it is from picking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7942)|
| 2:12:30| But unless the county requires that children ride school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| and not allow parents to pick them up, we have parents picking children up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| And I was in a meeting with Mr. Snowden last fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| and showed him a video of coming eastbound on Hardin Valley Road from, you know, Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7963)|
| 2:12:51| And traffic, the pickup traffic, has to sit on the right shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| so on the southbound shoulder of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| And then you have to play frogger and leapfrog with dump trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| that are coming through the school zone at the same time as pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| And you have to go through the stoplight and then try to get over as best you can and not get hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| and then turn left into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| And that was a video that I showed at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| And so part of it is this location right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| I think it would be wonderful if parents would make use of the school bus system for those that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8006)|
| 2:13:34| That's not an unusual situation in just about any school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| On that site, if it had been flat or relatively flat, I would have supported five units an acre on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| But the topography was not the traffic, not anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| It was the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Our attorney has asked to say a few words, and it's far between that he asks that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| so I'm going to give him the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| This discussion reminded me that some several months back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| Legacy Parks Foundation contacted Executive Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| and we met with them expressing concern about applicants coming before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| representing that there had been some deal cut for the dedication of property to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| that they either were unaware of or had not been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| And they were concerned that that name was being bandied about in a way to engender support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| and they weren't comfortable with it, and they encouraged the staff to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| Mr. Green encouraged him to take steps to ensure that that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| In the process, they have prepared a letter, which they will make available to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| that have actually consulted with them and made arrangements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| specific arrangements for the dedication of land to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| and they were asking in the absence of the letter that they provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| did that not be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| That's good information for our future consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| Did you have one more thing to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| Perhaps just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| I just wanted to stay as to the buses because I do live approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| maybe not even two miles from all of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| And just with all due respect, when you have all of these homes that are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| and that they're being built, and I've lived out there for 10 years, so this is nothing new to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| but so many of these developments now are in the parent responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| So you don't have an option for a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| Yes, the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| We also have no crosswalks, so I can't even allow my 13-year-old to walk home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| because there is no crosswalk on Hardin Valley Road to get safely where she needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| So that is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| And then secondly, because I am barely past the responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| I just want to make sure you all understand that while buses are a great option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| there is a huge shortage of buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| It took us three weeks just to get a bus to come to our neighborhood beside us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| because they had no buses and they said we were going to miss it because of the new middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| So it's not always so cut and dry that it's self-inflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| That's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| It sounds like the school board needs to be working on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| I'd like to hear what this gentleman has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| I'm Billy Fulgham, Fulgham-McIndoe Associates civil engineer for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| Again, the plans are almost approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| There is no change in the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| Although one thing to disturb me is that I met with Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| She came to my office to meet about the concept of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| She said, yeah, sure, I'll take it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| I said, may I use your name and NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| And she said, yes, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| No one informed me about a letter that I was supposed to have and bring with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| And they may still be working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| I'll contact Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| But at this point, I want you to know that I met with her at my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| She gave me approval to use her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| And, again, there's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| I think I mentioned it a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| And Commissioner Clancy, looking at the plan development approval process for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8228)|
| 2:17:14| it strikes me that this property is, as Commissioner Clancy said, would be appropriate for that review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| It was Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| Oh, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| I didn't mean to insult you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| I don't even look like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| And I'd be happy to talk with you about that if you want to give me a call tomorrow or the first of next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| and look at that as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| I appreciate all the community input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Sometimes there's some tough decisions that come before us, and sometimes they're easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| And I'm hoping that our next agenda item, number 47, will fall into the second category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8270)|
| 2:17:58| This is a use on review report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| The applicant is David Harbin, Batson, Himes, Norville, and Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| The location is the west side of Bell Stanley Road, southwest of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| The approximate size of the tract is 18,716 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8293)|
| 2:18:23| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| Staff recommendation is to approve the development plan for up to two detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| on individual lots subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| And I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| Mr. Harbin, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| What we have before us today is a large lot in, I think, the Wayland subdivision off Bell Stanley Road, Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8335)|
| 2:19:05| It's zoned PR, so we have to come here before you to do a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| As the staff report indicates, we're still well below the overall zoning density right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| I believe other properties have been subdivided previous in this subdivision right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| So our request is just to divide this property into two lots right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| Each will be about 61, 62 feet wide in that area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| As you can tell, it will match pretty closely to the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| All utilities are present, so we ask for approval for this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| Your name and address, and if you wouldn't mind just also jotting that down on the thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| I think you've watched long enough to get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8390)|
| 2:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8408)|

| 2:20:20| We bought this house two and a half years ago and had the opportunity to buy the lot also, but we turned that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8420)|
| 2:20:29| Didn't think we needed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| We found out that it was going to be sold, and there was a guy that was delivering dirt up there and dumping dirt on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8435)|
| 2:20:45| and I went out there and talked to him for a few minutes, and he told me, he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| yeah, they're going to build two houses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| I said, two houses on this one lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| I said, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| We pulled our rules out here, and it's the first one for restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8458)|
| 2:21:06| It says one single family resident shall be permitted on any lot, and said lot shall not be further subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| but may be replanted to alter lot lines if approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| The primary purpose is for single family home residential use only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| and I have talked to five of the seven people that live on Bell Stanley Road, and they're against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8486)|
| 2:21:35| because these houses built this way are going to have about six feet between the house lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8495)|
| 2:21:45| and houses will be within six feet of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| So I think that's going to just deflate our property values, and we're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8508)|
| 2:21:57| So the covenant that you're reading from, you've got a homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Well, I guess that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| It says Steve Hall Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| So this goes back a few years, but I don't know exactly how far, how long ago this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| But these are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| We just bought the house two and a half years ago, and these are the rules that they set for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| So I don't know of any other lots that's been subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| I know there's one being built now, and he owns three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| He built one big house on three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| Well, one of the things about the planning commission is our decisions have to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8553)|
| 2:22:40| on what are the guidelines for the density for that zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| and our decisions can't be made based on any covenants that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| I want to just kind of verify with our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| I know he's shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| So the density, this is a use on review, and that particular zoning does allow the density at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8577)|
| 2:23:08| but it does require the planning commission to have an opportunity to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| Well, I strongly urge you not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| Understood. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| Motion to approve the development plan for up to two detached dwellings on individual lots subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8603)|
| 2:23:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| I see no lights on other than Commissioner Clancy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| Thank you, Mr. Chandler, for coming in and sitting through this meeting to have an opportunity to voice your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8628)|
| 2:23:58| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190808_20190819?start=8641)|
