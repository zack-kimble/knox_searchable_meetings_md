| 0:00:29| Good afternoon and welcome to today's specially called meeting to serve as a public hearing for the candidates who are interested in fulfilling the County Commission seat for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=29)|
| 0:00:45| However, before I begin the meeting, I'd like to have a very brief moment of silence and reverence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=45)|
| 0:00:55| We just lost one of our presidents and I know today is the day of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| So many of our flags in our country are at half-mast and wherever you are politically, we still would like to come together in just a brief moment of silence in memory of President Bush who passed away this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=61)|
| 0:01:17| So everyone, please bow your heads or however you'd like to acknowledge this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=77)|
| 0:01:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| To begin the meeting, before we do roll call, I'm going to ask Commissioner Carringer to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Thank you, Chairman. Would everyone please rise, stand, and salute our pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=108)|
| 0:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Once again, the purpose of this meeting is to conduct interviews and to serve as the public hearing as required by law for us to appoint someone to this important position with our board and with Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=130)|
| 0:02:25| As we go through this, I want to manage everyone's expectations so you know exactly what's going to happen over the course of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| Each candidate is going to be given five minutes to speak about why you believe you would make the best and the most appropriate appointment to this important seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=153)|
| 0:02:46| At the conclusion of your five minutes, if any of the commissioners have questions for you, they will be given that opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=166)|
| 0:02:55| The question component will not count against your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Some of you may have a full five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Some of you may have three minutes or two and don't feel like you've got to stretch it out to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| I also want to let you know that we have had two of the candidates who originally expressed interest in this role have recently withdrawn their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=187)|
| 0:03:17| This may be news for even some of my fellow commissioners, but both Phil Ballard and Michelle Westover have both expressed an interest in withdrawing their names from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:30| The slate of applicants are Richie Beeler, Crystal Gibson, Douglas Iglehart, Rebecca Longmire, Sonia Suzanne Sanders, and Terry Wilshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:45| That is also the order that I will be asking you to come up and address county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Another bit of housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| This is not the meeting that we will be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| This first meeting is just the public hearing and the time for the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| At the conclusion of this meeting, as we posted, either at 2.30 or when this meeting is over is when we will have a separate meeting to do the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| and to vote on the actual resolution to formally appoint the person who we choose for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=249)|
| 0:04:18| I also have, and I'd like to recognize and thank my friend, the Honorable Christy Davis, who I see is on the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| So, Christy, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Whoever gets this, you know, frying pan meet fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| I've got Judge Davis is here so that you can be sworn in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| After this, you may work with me and we can have a formal ceremonial swearing in as part of the December commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| Does that all make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| I'm looking out at the applicants and I'm seeing heads nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| So, with all that said, I'm going to go ahead and my fellow commissioners, this is all seeing heads nodding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| so I think we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| So, I'm going to go ahead and begin by calling Richie Beeler to approach the, excuse me, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| Sorry, I was jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Yeah, we do need to have a roll call to officially start the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=311)|

| 0:05:33| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| All right, Mr. Beeler, would you please approach the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| My name is Richie Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| I live at 8313 Claps Chapel Road in Coryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| I'm seeking appointment to the Eighth District Commission seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| The Eighth District has been my home since I was born back in 1964| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| in a little neighborhood called Zachary Town in the very northeast corner of Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| My parents both grew up in the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| My grandparents all grew up in the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Most of my great-grandparents grew up in the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| I can remember as a child my mom's first job was as a clerk in the office at Skagston School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| which, of course, is East Knox now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| My grandfather was principal at Coryton School and also Clear Springs Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| back when it was in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| I don't tell you that to establish a pedigree of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| I just wanted you to know that I have deep roots in the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| I have a great love for the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| I have a great love for its communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Let me tell you why I'm seeking this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| I believe I bring to the table a combination of experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| a combination of perspectives that I think could serve Knox County well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| could serve this body well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| My full-time work at the moment is as a staff pastor at a church out in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And so I'm in the Eighth District every day, feet on the ground, interacting with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| hearing what their problems are, what their concerns are, what matters to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| I think that and my work with the schools, particularly Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| through their athletic department over the past 30-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| has given me a good pulse on what matters to the people in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| The other side of that coin is that I worked for Knox County for 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| I was in the Register of Needs office in various capacities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| and during that time I learned a lot about how county government works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| both structurally in terms of the government as well as fiscally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| in terms of how the different departments work, how they interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| what fee offices do as opposed to what general government does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| the way that the balance of power exists within county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| And I think I could bring some perspective on how those relationships could work best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| to help serve the citizens of Knox County best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| There are three issues that I would want to mention that I think of as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| There are many issues that are important to the Eighth District and to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| but there are three that come to my mind when I think about this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and they're in no particular order, but the first is land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| The Eighth District has a lot of it, if you haven't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| If you look at a map of the commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| the Eighth District is roughly twice the size of the second largest district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| and so there's a lot of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| And I think how we steward that moving forward is a great opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| could be a great resource for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| I think it's important that we balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I think it's important that we steward that in such a way that's respectful to the Eighth District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| and its citizens and their way of life, but also in a way that is best for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| best for Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I think as Knox County has opportunities for growth moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| the Eighth District is a great resource in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| The second issue is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| I think that the Eighth District is in the best position it's ever been educationally in terms of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| In the past 12 years, we've seen three new schools built in the Eighth District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Gibbs Elementary, Carter Elementary, and Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| But we have some wonderful community schools as well, such as Sunnyview and Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| I would love to, if I'm fortunate enough to receive this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| I'd love to meet individually with all of the principals at the different schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| to see what their needs are, what their wish lists are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| and to work with Mike McMillan, who I've had a great relationship with for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| on helping meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| The third issue is an issue that is no respecter of persons or geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| It's the opioid addiction epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| This is a very personal issue to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| I did a funeral last night of a young man who overdosed a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| I was counting that as the fifth young adult that I've buried as a college pastor in the past four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| and that's just too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| In fact, when you're looking in the eyes of a parent who's lost a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| one is too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| And I think there are ways that Knox County could partner with agencies and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| that have a proven record of success in helping adults manage life apart from addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| And so that's an important issue to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| As far as Knox County as a whole, I think Mayor Burch's leadership has been tremendous over the past eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| and I think we can build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I have great confidence in Mayor Jacobs and his team and his vision for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| and I think it's a great time to live in Knox County, but I think our best days are ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| So I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you so much for this opportunity to share, and I'll be glad to take any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you, Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| That is right at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Commissioners, by a show of lights, do any of you have any questions for Mr. Buehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you, Mr. Buehler, for applying to be part of our team up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| I have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Having worked within Knox County for 31 years, I think is what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| do you feel like you could be an objective and independent person in serving as a bit of an oversight role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| as we manage county government being so ingrained in this community here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Absolutely, I do, because my first objective would be to represent the citizens of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| That would be my number one concern, what matters to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| In terms of county government oversight, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I think I have an understanding of the roles of the different branches, if you will, of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| and I do understand that the role of this body is one of fiscal oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| and so I think I could absolutely do that objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| One other quick question, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| This is a two-year appointment to fill out the term vacated by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| After the two-year appointment is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| do you have current plans to run for this position again or any other office within Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| My candid answer to that is I have absolutely no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| I have no plans whatsoever about two years from now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| And just one answer for each one of them right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| What attribute do you have that makes you the best person for this job, one attribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| I think I'm teachable, quick learner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| My second question is what is the main or the most important thing that you consider a commissioner should know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| I think a commissioner should have an understanding of how county government works for its citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=770)|
| 0:13:00| and what the role of county commission is in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Mr. Beeler, this is something that I will ask all the ones who are interested in fulfilling Mr. Wright's thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=792)|
| 0:13:22| is knowing the exact boundaries of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=802)|
| 0:13:31| So I know you'd be the first one to ask this, but knowing where your lines are right now of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| Well, I'm glad that that wasn't part of my five-minute speech because it might have taken the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| But the 8th District encompasses from Fort Sumter all the way to the deepest recesses of East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| which I suppose would probably be Riverdale or Thorn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| It includes smaller communities such as Ramsey and Sunnyview, reaching the city limits near Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| and near North Knoxville, Fountain City, and halls on the western side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| So I could name all the precincts, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I want to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| One more light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| So the 8th District has the Midway Road project, the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| You've got new schools and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| You're going to have development and issues arising in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| How do you propose staying in touch with the entire district since it's so large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Well, I think it comes from growing up there, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| As I had said earlier, I was born and grew up in the northeastern part of Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| We were actually probably closer to Blaine than we were to Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| So I understand what it's like to live in the remote parts of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I actually live in one of the remotest parts of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| I can almost throw a rock into Union County from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| I spent a lot of my childhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| And when you grow up in the 8th District, as I know our law director understands this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| you see not really any separation between Carter and Thorn Grove and Riverdale and Skagston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| and Corrington and those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| It's just your way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| And so I don't see that as a particular challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| Is that it, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Seeing no other lights, thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| And we will call the next applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you, Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| The next applicant is Ms. Crystal Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Crystal Gibson, and I reside at 6143 Wishing Well Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| I'm married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I have two children, two children that live in the district, and I have a vested interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I also, just like Mr. Buehler, am almost a lifelong member of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| I grew up in the same community as he did, as well as another candidate who will speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| in just a moment, Mrs. Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I'm committed to my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| I've always had the desire to serve others, just as in my resume as I spoke about when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| I was a little girl, my parents, or anybody who had asked me what I wanted to be when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I grew up, it was always a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| I never wavered from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I've always had a desire to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| What I want to do is I want to work to make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| I'm not saying that anything's bad or anything right now, not only for our schools, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| the deputies, for other people that have a vested interest in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| When I'm applying for this or seeking the appointment, I want to be fully transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| and I want everybody to know that I am also an employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Not only am I an employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Office, my husband is an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Being also an employee representative through the Merit System Council, I reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| the law director's office and got an opinion to see if there would be any conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| From my understanding, because it's an appointment, there's no conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| I've been working towards helping the deputies for many years, and I want to continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| through the commission and also for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| If something popped up and there happened to be a conflict of interest, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| all I have to do is the disclaimer that follows the ordinance as well as the TCA's and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| the public declaration of that vested interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| That's the transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I'm a very open-minded person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I'm green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| I'm not like Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I don't have years and years of experience working in county government in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| I have experience working with people and government, but not in the same way as most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| of the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| That's what I would give to you that I bring to the table is that I'm different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Yes, I'm green, but yes, I'm teachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I'm a researcher by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I love to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I love to work for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| I'm an independent thinker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| You've got two more minutes, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| What we can do is we can move to the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Would any of my fellow commissioners have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I'm going to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| What attribute that you bring with you makes you the best candidate today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| I'm energetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| The second question is, what's the one thing that you think is the most important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| that you should know as a county commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| I think as a county commissioner, you should know and you should never forget that you are a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| That's another thing about myself is that I have a voice, but my voice is not what I want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| I want the voice of my community to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| And as long as you, working in the public capacity, remember that, that you are a servant to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| then I think that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Can I ask for some clarification from the Law Department on the conflict of interest briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| The State of Tennessee has declared that an employee of the government can be and can serve in public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| Also, this is, in terms of the Merit Council limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| there are not any activities that would be in conflict with being appointed to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| And there are procedures whereby you can run for office and still be, for example, a member of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| The only conflict may be is if you vote directly on something that would directly impact your personal family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1213)|
| 0:20:23| But that can also be disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Budgetary items, for example, on the Sheriff's Department is not really one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| because it is a broad, over-sweeping thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| So I don't see any great conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| I'm trying to think of something that might come up that would be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| But even at that, you can recuse yourself from that one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| And the law allows for this individual to serve if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| I just have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| What do you feel is the greatest challenge facing the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and the greatest opportunity for the 8th District as you see it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| The greatest opportunity, I believe, for the 8th District would be the residents and how the growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| I'm sorry, you said what's the greatest and what's the biggest obstacle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| What's the biggest challenge the 8th District faces today and what's the biggest opportunity for it in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| The biggest challenge is the shoes that will be filled from the former commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| That's the biggest challenge the District faces is who will represent them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| I think that you have to have that community togetherness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| And bringing someone new to the table is a difficult transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| not only transitioning into something via an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| but the lines of communication, just as the question was asked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| we have to be able to communicate with one another and to build those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| And doing the transition, you have to overcome that obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| Because if you can't communicate, you can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| You can't improve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| So you have to build those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| As the previous question, I just wanted to make sure that you do know the big boundaries of how big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:26| and how large District 8 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| So if there was anything you wanted to elaborate on the boundaries and voting precincts or any experience in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| No, I did actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| I made a map just to make sure that I could see the roads, but then I printed it and made it in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| But, yeah, I'm aware of how large the area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| And one reason why I'm asking this is because my district splits Murphy Road right down Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:59| If you're in Summer Rose, you're in the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| And if you're in Shannon Valley, you're in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| So mine splits right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| So there's a lot of my district that goes hand in hand right there with the people in our schools and all that represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1389)|
| 0:23:19| So I just want to make sure that everybody that is wanting and going for this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| understands what a big district it is and where the boundaries and all lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| And I want to thank you for being so energetic and so positive because Knox County is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| and we need those people that are energetic and are ready to help move us forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| So thank you for applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| So over the next year and a little over a half, obviously we're going to be facing some things in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| Like I stated earlier, the Midway Road Project, the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| and with the new Gibbs Middle School coming and the elementary school being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| there's going to be people moving to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| How do you feel about the development coming into that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| And also, how do you plan on keeping in touch with the residents of the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| How do I feel about development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I think the development is wonderful if the community welcomes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| What was the second question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| How are you going to keep in touch with the people of the 8th District since it's such a large district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| That would be something that I just have to navigate my way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| You know, one step at a time, that's always been my motto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| You know, start small, go big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| But you just take it one step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| And I don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| I can't answer that with full honesty because I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| But I'll do the best that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Whether appointed today or not in 2020, will you seek election to this office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| I'm going to go with Richie Beeler's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| At this point, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| And it would be dishonest of me to sit here and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| I know what my plans are in two years, but I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| I was very impressed with your resume and your letters of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| And the question I'm going to ask you now I'm going to ask of other candidates today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| We were furnished information from the Knox County Election Commission about your voting history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| And in this community, we do have a voter apathy where a small percentage of the electorate actually vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1539)|
| 0:25:51| And I noticed in your election history that for 2018, you nailed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| You hit the primary, the county primary in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| But I noticed that the last four previous election cycles, you've not participated in the county general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:10| which would have, you know, voted for, say, Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| You didn't participate even in the election when your former boss was up for election as sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| And so I'm just curious why all of a sudden you – is there a reason maybe that for the last four election cycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1582)|

| 0:26:46| Any other final statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| You've still got two minutes remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I just appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| We're grateful for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| The next candidate is Douglas Engelhardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And I hope, Douglas, I'm doing a good job pronouncing your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| My name is Doug Engelhardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| I live at 330 Drummer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| It's right there off Asheville Highway, off Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| I am not a Tennessean from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| I'm a transplant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I grew up in Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| I went south to seek a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| I actually came here as a basketball coach at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| When we decided we weren't going to coach college anymore as a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| we looked for the place we thought would be best for our family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and we liked East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| We liked it because it was quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| It had a lot of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| We liked the people that lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| For me, since we moved this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| it's probably been 28 years we've lived in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| I worked for the school system for about 25 years before I retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| I still work for the school system as a part-time teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| And I thought the reason that I wanted to, you know, being a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| sometimes you don't have the opportunity to get into the politics and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| because by your meeting, we're still at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| or we're doing our meeting stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| so we don't really get a chance all the time to participate in everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| If you call a meeting and you're trying to get support, teachers are at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| I want to represent those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I want to represent my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| We got a lot of people out there that probably don't have that opportunity to get out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| I want to be that person that speaks for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I want to find out what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| I know one of the questions is, how am I going to keep in touch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I'm going to do something I don't know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I'm going to try Twitter, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Next thing I know, I don't know, you guys might be yelling at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| that I'm turning into a president or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| But I'm going to try to do whatever I can to try to keep in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| I'm going to go to community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| I want to get to know those people, and I want to know what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| I know that a lot of those people probably want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| I want the same thing my kids want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| I have four daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Two of them still live in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| One of them owns a business in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| My wife works for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| We know those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I taught at Carter for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I've been at Austin East for a large majority of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| I have taught summer school every year since I've been in education here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| So I know your kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I know the area you're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| I understand because when you have a chance to be a driver's ed teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| you get kids in the car and you have a chance to talk to them a little bit one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| I kind of get a chance to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I understand what they're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So it's not like I just know what's going on in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| And I'm hoping that all this time that I coached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| and all the times that I've been teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| I'm hoping that maybe some of that stuff will help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| I'm going to call it quits right there because I only get a minute time out as a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| I went over my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Now we'll move on into questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Well, first of all, thank you so much for taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| and for wanting to make a difference in Knox County and in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| I appreciate that so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| And when I read on your resume you raised four daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Wow, is all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| And say that backwards, you get wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| So living in a household with five women, you've already won, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| And also the fact that you're from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| A lot of my family, both my mom and dad, are from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| So Kentucky is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And Knox County is certainly a top-notch place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| And I'm thankful to have been born and raised in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| But I'm going to ask you the same question as far as how large 8th District is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| and knowing exactly all the different areas that the 8th District comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:47| Are you aware of how large it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| And the differences also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| You know, there's different parts of the 8th District that require different things than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| the other parts of 8th District, just like all of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| But 8th District is a very unique district, I think, as to how large it is in the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| It is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Yeah, you know, I guess over my time with my children, and they go, Dad, can you take me here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| I found a lot about the 8th District I probably didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| I found some roads I didn't even know were roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| So I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| You know, with sporting events, with school activities and stuff, I had a chance to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| There's a lot I still haven't found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| But it's got a lot of diversity in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| So you got little towns, but they're not the same, just like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| It's got their own little personality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| So, yeah, I kind of understand where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| We're like the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| And we go up the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| You know, I mean, I've been in there with the school and coaching and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| I've been to pretty much all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Commissioner Busler, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Dave Wright and I used to have an argument about where halls stopped and the 8th District started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| And so we still got those battle lines out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| But anyway, the question again I want to ask, what one attribute do you have that makes you the best person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| that's here today to be a commissioner for the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Second question is, again, what's the most important thing as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| that you need to know to be commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| One thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I think the thing that kind of we need to be able to do is I can adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| That's one thing about coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| First of all, we'll steal anybody's idea that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| And if we can make it work for us, make it work for our community, we will take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| I think that you need to be able to adapt to whatever's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| The thing I think that I don't know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| So when I have to make a decision, I need to go talk to the people that it's going to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| So I think that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I'm going to listen to what you have to say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| I either agree or disagree, whatever, but I think that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| But if I don't know, I'm going to go find out because I'm going to make decisions that's going to affect people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| It's not just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| It's everybody in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Is that it, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Besides the school activities, can you give me any community activities that you've been involved in outside of school activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2077)|
| 0:34:47| I did, for years, I helped sponsor the Teens for Christ inside of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| Also worked with the police department, and I can't even remember what the name of it is, and I had it on my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| But basically, it was a group that the police department would come in, work with our kids, take them on different activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| but try to get them to understand what goes on in the communities and try to build a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And I was a sponsor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I'm going to tell you something else I did, and I still can't believe I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I was the sponsor for the step team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| If you don't know what a step team is, that's where they play music, do all those weird stomping and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| I had no idea about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| I put on sports camps for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Didn't really charge anything for them, just because we wanted kids to have an opportunity to get out and learn some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| I volunteered to help different schools when they needed some coaches and stuff, and I brought my kids in who had played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2141)|
| 0:35:50| I just try to help where I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Again, I'll ask you, either appointed or not, when 2020 rolls around, will you seek election to this office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| My intentions would be yes, but if I don't feel that I did a good job for my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| if I don't think I did a good job for the commission, I would say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Your resume says that you were a men's assistant grad coach at UT's basketball program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| And you're from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| When Kentucky plays Tennessee, who do you cheer for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| You grew up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| You didn't go to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I have to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| I'm not a Kentucky fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I grew up in Louisville, so I've always been for Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| I can't even have a conversation in my own family get-togethers because they're all Kentucky fans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| and I think they're crazy, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Good question, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Next, Commissioner Biggs, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| The 8th District is obviously one of the largest districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Given the Midway Road Project, the Sheriff's Office, the Tent Facility, and Gibbs Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| and elementary school being the development headed in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| how do you feel about development in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| as well as how are you going to stay in touch with it being such a large district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| I'm all for the building up the area, but I think it has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| We have to do it smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| We don't want to do like they've done in the past in some places where they kept building, building, building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| and then the roads don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| If we're going to develop the 8th, and, again, we have plenty of areas for the 8th District to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| We need to make sure that it works for the people, that we're not going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| okay, we're going to build this stuff, and then we have to turn around and go, whoops, that don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| We need to make sure we plan for that stuff, make sure that our roads work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| because we want to probably bring in a little bit more industry back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| we want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| So we've got to make sure that we're going to convince people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| if you're going to come in, we can accommodate what you want, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| So, I mean, if you don't know, over at the John Sevier, we've got all these truckers and stuff going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| and those roads really don't accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| We've got to make sure we can accommodate, that we can pull the business in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| and they want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Did you have another question I was supposed to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| How do you plan on voicing the residents of the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| so you can stay in touch with them, so you can be their voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Well, we're going to try that Twitter thing, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| But the other thing is, too, I'm going to start going to some of these activities they do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| because that's the best place to find out, because people are going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| and they're going to tell you what they believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I'm going to try to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Ms. Gill kind of scared me a little bit, says she don't get to go home except for an hour a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| because she's always busy with what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| But she says she's always going to activities, she goes out and meets the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and that's what I'm going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| It doesn't help sometimes if we just e-mail each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| we don't always get the true feeling what people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| I want to make sure that I represent you for best for you, not best for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| best for you and your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you for what you've done in your career to mold young minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| And, again, I'm going to ask the question on the information that was provided by the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2382)|
| 0:39:51| In 2018, this year, we had an opportunity, I should say you had an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| in the spring to participate in the county primary where we selected two at-large commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| who are sitting here today, the new county sheriff and the new county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| And you chose not to participate in that election in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| and then the county general election in August, you decided not to participate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| And then two years previous to that, when Commissioner Wright was on the ballot to represent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| you decided not to participate in the county elections again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| Is there some reason that you don't feel like you should vote for your local officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| No, that's not really what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| I think I told you guys when I first started that while things are going on, we're still at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| And it was one of those busy, I kept saying, I've got to vote, got to vote, got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| By the time that things slowed down that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| and the bad thing is the voting precinct is right across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| But by the time I got home, the precinct was closed on both those occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| It wasn't that I wasn't planning on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| It was just that there were so many things going on with school and other activities, I missed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| I think if you look at the rest of the time, I tried to vote religiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| Those are just two of those times where life kind of got in the way, and I missed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| And I was a little upset for the simple fact that I missed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| I can't complain if I don't vote, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| And that was the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| I can't say that you're not doing a good job if I didn't get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| And again, life just kind of took me on those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| No, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| You've still got about a minute 48 left if you'd like to make a closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| No, I'd just like to thank you guys for listening to me, giving me the opportunity, even though I'm from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| So I just hope whoever you put in this position will work for the people of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| I hope that when I talked on the phone the other day, I hope that we can keep the 8th District kind of nice, quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:16| give it a chance to grow, but let's don't let it overgrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Let's keep it that nice, quiet little area that people love about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| They've been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Let's make sure they don't lose that nice, quiet area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Our next candidate is Ms. Rebecca Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| I'm Rebecca Longmire, 9909 East Emery Road, Coreyton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| I am not a lifelong member of 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I didn't move there until I was four years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| So I will have to say that I've lived there longer than Mr. Beeler because I'm that much older than he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| I have been active in the county work before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| As you can tell from my resume, I did work with the civilian or the citizen oversight on the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| I have been on MPC for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| I finished my term in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I think that having served the county in various ways, I see the importance of continuing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2600)|
| 0:43:29| I'm afraid that many people don't see how important county commission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| I think they overlook the word county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I would be happy to represent District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| That's my home district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| But also, every one of you also works for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| That what you vote on will affect my 8th District and what I vote on will affect your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| That we have to work together to make Knox County as a whole the kind of county that we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| I feel that in 35 or so years of teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| I have dealt with a variety of people, both students and parents, and heaven help me, supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| So I would be able to work well with anybody that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| I come from a family that has always encouraged public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| working for the best that we can be to make where we live the best we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| I do have a vested interest in the Coryton area since one of my sons lives there and my husband and I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| But talking about the size of the 8th District, Commissioner Carringer, it's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| Now you and I will be able to get along well sharing Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| I don't worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| And going down into Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I feel sorry sometimes for those poor people who voted for Summer Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| who think they're voting for Halls people and realize, no, they're voting for people that they don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| So I would work very hard to make sure that all areas of 8th District come into my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| I will say this, they're not all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| You have Halls, which is a very commercial active place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| You have the Murphy Road area, which is a suburban place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| What we call across the river in the Carter area is still very rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| I think you have to be aware of that as you look at how the area is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| The new schools are wonderful, but what do new schools bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| They bring in families that want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And I think it's very important that we do development wisely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| development that fits the area, what each community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| It's just a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| 8th District is in a changing area, a changing mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| And I feel like that I could represent that area and represent Knox County in a wise and compassionate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| And I would like to reserve my – I want to say one other thing, how proud I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| You may not know it, but Richie Beeler and Crystal Gibson are former students of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| And I am so proud of them and proud to have been able to teach so that there are people who do go into public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| And I'm really, really proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| They've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I'm sure there's some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Again, I'll ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| What one attribute did you have that makes you the best person to be this commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Well, my degree is in information science, so I'm pretty big in information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| But I think one of my strong points, other than patience, is that I'm a consensus builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| I realize that we can't always please everybody, that it's not possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| But I believe that we could reach a consensus on the best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| And the second question that I've asked before is what's the one most important thing that a commissioner should know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2835)|
| 0:47:26| Well, I think it's very important to know the law, that what a commissioner can do and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| I found that out at MPC, that there are certain things that you have the power to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| and certain things you don't have the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| But I think communication, that communication is a huge thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| both with other commissioners and with the people in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Given the opportunity to serve, you've got the Midway Road project going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| and the sheriff's department as well, or the jails out there and Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| there's going to be development coming in your direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| You said develop wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I appreciate you addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| But how would you stay in contact with the residents of the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| to make sure that their voice is heard whenever you sit before us on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Well, I can probably say I'm not going to go on Twitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| I think it's very important to talk to people face to face if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| Telephones are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Texting and email are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| But I really like to see a person face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I think you learn a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I do go to quite a few community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| I'm active in a lot of organizations that deal with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| But I also was very impressed with Ed Brantley and Bob Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| how they went out into the community and had open meetings with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| And I think it's very important to go to all the areas of 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| even in the halls area, Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| I'll draw that line very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| But to make sure not only that I know what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| but so that they meet me and get to know me and feel comfortable dealing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Ms. Longmire, during your 12 years on MPC as the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| and development arm of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| can you tell us a little bit about what you learned that would directly translate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| to the next 10 or 12 years ahead of a growing county and a growing 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| What did you learn and how does that translate to the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| that might be ahead of us or opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Well, having worked with land issues and learning zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| and the laws and things that govern land use is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2990)|
| 0:49:59| I learned that Knox County's infrastructure does not stand up to development in many places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| There's no place where road work is not needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| The importance of utilities to make sure that utilities are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| that can handle whatever development comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| There is a need for increased business development as well as residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| But at the same time, one has to take into consideration the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| because a community has the right to have input into what is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| And that's another reason I think communication is so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| because people don't always understand why a person votes a certain way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| or has to vote a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So I think that my time on MPC is very helpful as far as land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| and the use of rules that will carry over, but also dealing with a variety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| MPC serves as advisory to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| And so I know that many of the cases on MPC often come before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| And so dealing with people who are pro-development, anti-development, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| every person has the right to an opinion, but not every opinion is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| So learning to come to a consensus to try to keep things going smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| so that Knox County can become the best county it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you, Ms. Lombard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| And Ms. Lombard, I know that there's no doubt you know where all the district lines lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| with all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| And I do know that we work well and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| I do want to kind of back up a little bit on what you just said about wisely development and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| because our districts do connect as well as I know, and I know you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:06| what traffic issues we are getting and the safety issues on Tassel Pike and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:16| And the development that is going on because people are wanting to come to our end of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| and because we have so many people that are wanting to move to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| because we have been the best kept secret, I think, for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| But the secret's getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| The people want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| I might have leaked that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| So the one issues that my district and that I've known from childhood is we have a big flooding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3158)|
| 0:52:48| particularly around the Emerald Boulevard, Fairmont, Tassel Pike, Herald Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| and around Summer Rose and all that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| And the difficult thing is that Tassel Pike is a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| It also is city and it's also county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| So we have lots of opinions that get thrown about on whose responsibility it is to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| We in the next, really, we're way behind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| We need something done tomorrow, today, about Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| So it has, some developments have interfered with that and caused more flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| And everybody, I feel, is trying to be the best they can be to represent everybody and to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3215)|
| 0:53:45| So I am kind of wondering on some of your previous votes with MPC about the Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| and some future developments and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Will you be able to really listen to the people in other districts as to the real need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| and what they feel best in all those terms of development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| Because we are really at a real crossroads in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| with doing what is going to protect already people's properties and their values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| and not cause more harm on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Because development is to develop, but they are not to cause any more issues or make something worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| And I'm really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I'm concerned for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I'm concerned for the people I represent in District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| and trying to do the right thing in terms of all of it involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| As you know, when a development comes before MPC to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| we always talk to county engineering or city engineering or sometimes both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| depending on where the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| If engineering says the infrastructure is there to handle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| and I'm talking about air quality, water quality, everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| then that is something we really have to take into strong consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| because that is a group advisory to us who has knowledge that, frankly, I may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| I know communities are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I know that there has been development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| I can tell you an apartment development on Tazewell Pike that covered up springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| When you cover up springs, when you cover up sinkholes, water is going to go somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| and it may go somewhere that it didn't go before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| That is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| It is a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Traffic is a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| But there's no place in Knox County where traffic isn't a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| And that's what I said about not just my district but the whole of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| What are we going to do about the traffic problems in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| Frankly, I've driven down Alcoa Highway, and I don't think Knox County has as much a problem as Alcoa Highway has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| But you have to listen to experts as well as the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| You have to research and see if you build here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| where is that water that comes up every five years when there's a flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Where is it going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| So it's a really broad spectrum of knowledge that one has to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| and it has to be done development by development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| As far as Tazewell Pike is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| you will remember when Smith Wood fought against widening Tazewell Pike there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| because it was a historic road and it has caused a big backlog of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| So sometimes working with community groups to reach a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| on how to maintain character and still allow for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| It's not an easy decision for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| So, I mean, that's the best I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| You just have to seek information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Ms. Longmire, again, I'm going to ask you the question about the Knox County Election Commission information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| The only problem is that there's you and one other candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| that have not missed a county primary, a county general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| a state primary election, or a state general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| So I want to commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| So your record is pretty impressive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Voting, especially in local elections, is the most important thing a citizen can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| Presidential elections are nice, but local is what really affects one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Commissioner Skinmaker, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you, Ms. Longmire, for your long service on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| It was a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| And for your chairmanship of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| When you serve on MPC, I presume, and tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| do you look at things purely in a planning aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Well, we take into consideration community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| One of the things I'm proudest of is the increase of community or neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| that have come together to speak on projects in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| When I started on MPC, rarely, well, Fountain City Town Hall was a huge one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| They were always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| But since then, neighborhood groups and community advocacy groups have come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| That's one thing that 8th District needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| There's not enough of advocacy groups for communities in 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| But basically, there were rules that we had to follow sometimes that did not make anybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| When you sit in a position on commission, you have to look at things in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| You have to look at funding for schools, funding for a health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| funding for libraries, and funding for the functions of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| You had said that our infrastructure was lacking pretty much in many areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| How would you propose we pay for infrastructure needs improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| I think that's something I would need to study more about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I know that in some counties there is an infrastructure tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| I know that developers are not happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| But that is one way in certain areas to improve the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| I was very surprised learning about utilities on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| pretty much the freedom that utilities have without much oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| which also leads to the flooding problems and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And I don't know that county commission can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I think it has to be done at a state level perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| But it's something that has to be taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| when one is considering any kind of growth in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Commissioner Smith, that's got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| You've got one minute on your time left if you'd like to make a closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I'm just very honored that I'm able to be speaking to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| and to be considered to be a member of county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| and to thank you for the job that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=3639)|

| 1:09:06| I think when there is a plan, I think there needs to be stakeholders brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4146)|
| 1:09:15| I think that the constituents, the people need to have a say for roadways and signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| and landscaping and lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| If something's going to happen, I want the 8th District to have a voice in how it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| Okay, but just quickly going back, are you optimistic about the Midway project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| Are you against the Midway project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Are you embracing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| What is your personal stance on the development that's happening in that part of the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| I'm not against change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| I am not happy that what's going out there personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| But for whatever does go out there, I think that the Knox County, the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| the people in Thorn Grove, the people in Midway can have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| I think you form a group of people and there's been lots of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| I've been to the meetings out at the river where the birding park is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I've seen the posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| I've seen the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| They've taken people's ideas and they've listened to them and you could write down things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| And I think that's great that people have gotten out there to let people have a view, like this is the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| This is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| But with any change, you need stakeholders and you need people that will be willing to be on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4237)|
| 1:10:46| to help make that change, to ease it in, to have people feel like I had a part in this and I can accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| I think Commissioner Biggs was before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Commissioner Jay kind of hit on what I was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| So how would you stay in contact with the members of the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| It's such a large district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| You've got a lot going on up there and are going to continue to have a lot going on up there over the next year and eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| I have to follow Dave Wright's footsteps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| I have to be visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I have to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| I have to attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| I have to be accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| I have to be a listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And then I would have to come back with my constituents' concerns and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| Ms. Sanders, I want to say right now you answered both of my questions in a very forceful way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| and in a way you're saying that you're committed to that community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| And I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| And what we're doing here is we're replacing Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| We're not electing a new commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| And you did say that you were going to follow on what Dave was doing, and I appreciate that thought also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| If appointed today or not in 2020, will you seek election to this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| I love my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| If I've done a good job, I'm going to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Again, from the information provided by the Knox County Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| you are the other candidate that has a stellar record of participating in every county primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| every county general, every state primary, and every state general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| So I guess in kind of an education background, you've got perfect attendance as far as voting, and that's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| But I was also interested on your resume, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| One, that you volunteer your time for the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| You're also involved with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| But the other thing that caught my attention, because this body is going to have to deal with it in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| is you served on Knox County's charter committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Which that was probably something you could write a book about, having to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| But I appreciate that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| And that's really huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| I mean, if you're a commissioner, you have to know what the charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| You have to go by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| And if my understanding is correct, it's going to come back up in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and there will be a new committee appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| So I appreciate your service on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| And then also, after spending a career in education, you still want to go back and substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| That's pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I feel like Miss America when I go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| All the kids love me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| In fairness to the folks that came down today, your fan club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| do they mind to just stand up so we can see who actually came down to support you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Because we did get a lot of e-mails and phone calls as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| It's a children's fiancé, PTO board, and I had all of their children, and they still like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4462)|
| 1:14:33| And I have my sister-in-law here that taught at Gibbs for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| We started teaching together, and she was the blonde-headed one, and I was the black-headed one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4478)|
| 1:14:46| and that's how they told us apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| And I appreciate him coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| You've got 18 seconds left if you'd like to make a closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I appreciate your vote and your nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| And thanks for the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Next is our final candidate, which is Terry Wilshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4506)|
| 1:15:15| I believe he sent an e-mail saying he was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| This concludes the interview component of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| Based on the agenda that we set, we now have time for the commissioners to begin some discussion, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4531)|
| 1:15:40| With that said, I'll open to discussion by recognizing Commissioner Carringer's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| You'll need to adjourn and come back into session, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| I think when we did the original agenda for this meeting, we did include discussion in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| He's not sorry to start the next meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Oh, just doing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| We're going to do discussion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Just to be in fairness to all candidates who came and spoke to us today, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you so much for caring about Knox County and for wanting to serve because county commission is a servant's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4573)|
| 1:16:25| And I'm truly honored to be able to represent District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| But to be fair, and just let me know, did Ms. Longmire get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| Did you ask Ms. Longmire about her intentions of possibly running in 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4605)|

| 1:16:49| I just would like to ask her because I think she was one of the ones that didn't get asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| Oh, I thought he had just looked at me and thought, Lord, she's too old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| She can't run again in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Have you seen Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Oh, well, that is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| Now, Commissioner Smith, I thought he is such a gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| He was such a gentleman and he brought Ms. Sanders a drink of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| Is that public slander?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Can I sue that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| I think he just wanted me to admire your lovely silver hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Thank you, both commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I appreciate the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| But moving on to Commissioner Carringer to finish your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| I really can't answer that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Two years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I have no idea what life will bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| I will do the best while I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| And then we'll see how it goes from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you so much for that answer because that is the best answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| And I've been right there in your position before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| And it's funny how one little word people can take and construed as meaning something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| because, you know, circumstances happen in life every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| And what we plan to do tomorrow, and we may say we're going to do tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| but circumstances happen, and we don't always get to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| and we have to change a whole direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or the rest of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| And I don't believe, and when you get through, if you want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| I was just going to say one of my favorite Bible verses is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| this is the day the Lord has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Let us rejoice and be glad in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Each day is special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| I don't know that Richie was asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| I just want to be fair that everybody gets asked these, I feel like, important questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| Richie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I believe he did answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Hold your microphone down, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| He said he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Richie said he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| So did everyone else get that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I'm not sure if Douglas did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| He answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Did Mr. Agarhart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| My other question that I realized was being asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| I don't remember if Commissioner Skinmaker asked Mr. Beeler about his voting record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| Did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| I did not, and I will be glad to give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| He basically had the almost perfect voting record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| although he did not participate in the state general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| and the election of the vice president and president this past time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| But he was there for the county primaries and county general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| just did not, like for individuals like Harry Brooks, did not vote for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| or the vice president or the president, based on the information that was provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Mr. Beeler, do you want to comment or anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| That was my two questions that I came away from as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| So thank you again to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I just want to thank each of the candidates for coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| and being willing to represent your districts and to serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| I know our charter says we have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| but whenever we have to appoint a commissioner to a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| that's one of the things I like least because I truly, truly believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| in the democratic process and that the people get to elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| That's one of the reasons why I asked you all if you were intending to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| I would prefer, but it's cost prohibited, to have special elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| to let the people actually have their choice on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| So thank you all for showing the willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| I mean, if I might weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| It's one of those things where I feel like we've got a deep bench of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Not only are we thankful for you expressing your interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| but we've got, frankly, a lot of good people that bring a lot of good skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| and community networking and experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| Speaking for myself, I know this has been something I've put a lot of thought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| a lot of intentionality, and there's no obvious easy answer on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| I mean, to my fellow commissioners, there's a lot of good ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| and I want to second what Commissioner Smith has said about how, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| we'd love to take the easy way out and just let everybody in the community vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| but we are tasked with helping find someone to fill this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| So is there any other comments or things that any of my fellow commissioners would like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Well, based on our published agenda, what I'd like to do is now ask for a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| A motion first was made by Commissioner Gill and seconded by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| The meeting is now closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| I'm going to give it about a one-minute break just to shuffle my paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| and then we'll open the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Commissioners, if you'd like to get a drink of water, why don't we actually make this a five-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| and then we'll reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=4972)|

| 1:30:59| for a position on Knox County Commission serving in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| Before we begin the meeting, I'm going to ask Madam Clerk to officially call the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5465)|

| 1:31:30| For my fellow commissioners, for all of our applicants, and for the general public, Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| County Commission has very specific rules regarding when we appoint someone to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| a position like this or to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| I did this at our last meeting and I want to ask your forgiveness because this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| take just a couple of minutes, but for the benefit of everyone, I'm going to read from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| the Knox County Commission rules exactly how this process will take place to frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| get all of us on the same page and it also serves as a great refresher both for me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| my fellow commissioners, so if you all might grant me that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| The nominations will be taking place via a roll call vote, but according to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| Commission rules, page 5, article 1, which is starting at section D, nominators may speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5535)|
| 1:32:24| about their nominee, nominees may speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| After nominations are ended, nominations shall be closed by motion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| The chair will then call for discussion by commissioners regarding all the nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| After each commissioner is afforded ample opportunity to express his or her views and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| responding views, the chair will ask if all commissioners are ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| If any commissioner wants further discussion, further discussion shall be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| When discussion is complete, voting will commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| By roll call vote, each commissioner may vote in favor of one nominee by name and the nominee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| with the least number of votes is disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| What this means is when we do a roll call vote, commissioners will have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| to place someone's name in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| Once that first roll call vote, if say there's three or four who have been put on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| when we complete the roll call vote, the person who has the fewest number of votes will drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| from consideration from that round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| After each vote, the chair will invite further discussion by commissioners regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| remaining nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| If there is a tie vote, and that's a possibility, my fellow commissioners, because we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| have a tie vote because we're a body of 11 that is missing one, we could have a 5-5 situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| the chair will invite the nominators and remaining nominees to speak again and the chair will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| invite further discussion by the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Voting will resume until a nominee receives the votes of a majority of the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| the commission eligible to vote on the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| To confirm, Mr. Law Director, we've got a body of 10 and for this purpose, that is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| will not be counting it as 11, we'll be counting it as 10, but to get a majority of the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| that would be six votes, is that to confirm that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Six vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| If a candidate gets six votes on the first round, then they are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| So, I guess what I'd like to do now is I'll go ahead and ask Madam Clerk to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| begin the nominations based on a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5670)|
| 1:34:41| In this case, I know this is for our voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Commissioners, what we'll do here is we'll go in traditional order for putting folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| on the floor and then when we do the actual vote, I believe Commissioner Anders, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| your turn, you're due for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| So, I'm going to ask Madam Clerk to begin the nominations beginning with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=5695)|

| 1:44:09| Commissioner Bessler votes for Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6255)|
| 1:44:35| Process-wise, we do not have a majority of six votes going in for one particular candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6275)|
| 1:44:43| By the way, I will first ask if anybody would like to change their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| Just on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Seeing no one wishing to change their vote, I'll announce the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| At present, we have Richie Beeler has four, Ms. Sanders has three, and Ms. Longmire has three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6294)|
| 1:45:02| So, no one drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| We had basically a tie for second place on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| So, what I'd like to open up on the floor is to see if there's any additional discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| and then we will vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| So, any other discussion any commissioners might want to weigh in on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| Also, it's a great time if you want to ask another question of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| We've got three good candidates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| It's a great time if there's a good opportunity if you'd like to ask any questions of any of these candidates as well again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| That's certainly something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| Let's see if there's any lights on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Seeing none, we will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| We'll go ahead with one additional vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| See if anybody wants to change their mind this time, and then we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Have another round of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6370)|

| 1:47:13| Okay, 3-3-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Nothing has changed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| But what I'd like to ask if any of the commissioners wish to change their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| The total was Richie Beeler, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Ms. Sanders had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| And Ms. Longmire had three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I'd like to open up the floor to discussion again and to see if any of the commissioners would like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| Or, once again, it's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| What I might do is take Chairman's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| We have three candidates remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| I'd like to give each of you two minutes to make another statement to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6464)|
| 1:47:55| We'll go in the order that we began with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| So we have got Mr. Beeler, you'll be first, followed by Ms. Longmire, and then Ms. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| Each of you all, I'd like to give you two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| Or, well, you know what, Commissioner Carringer said, why don't we change it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| So I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| So we'll go in reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| We'll go with Ms. Sanders, then Ms. Longmire, then Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| I'll yield to Ms. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| I have been a longtime resident of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| I have been very supportive of all things that have gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| Both of my grandfathers were in World War I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| My father was in World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| So service is not a coincidence for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| It's a way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| And Ms. Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| I didn't speak about my community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| I am in the Ruritan Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| I got the Gibbs High School Foundation started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| I am scorekeeper at the Scholars Bowl competition that Mr. Biggs came to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6556)|
| 1:49:24| I'm very active in my church, in addition to serving the community where I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| I think service is one of my strong points, and I think my knowledge from my work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| not only at MPC but with also some of the appointments that I have dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| I know that one of the questions that was not asked me was what might one of the biggest problems be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| Having been on the Citizens' Board for review of the jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I think that is something we really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| From my perspective, the only thing that prisoners learn in jail is to be better criminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| that sometimes education might be an answer to the overcrowding problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| And I think the idea that I'm an open-minded person, willing to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| and willing to work for Knox County as a whole as well as the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6622)|
| 1:50:30| I think what I would say at this point is I respect the fact that this is a tremendously difficult decision before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6630)|
| 1:50:39| I think that sort of bears out in the vote, the score, if you will, at 4 to 3 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| These are great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6646)|

| 1:51:06| She's a treasured friend for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| So, honestly, I don't know what else I can tell you about myself that you don't know from my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| and perhaps from the letters that you received other than to say I do this out of a deep love for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| I do not do this for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| I hope you hear my heart on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| I made a lot of friends in 31 years working with Knox County and, I hope, very few enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| But friendship is one thing and government is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| And so I simply stand here as one who deeply cares about the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| the communities in the 8th District, and the people in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| And I would be incredibly appreciative of the opportunity to serve them and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6708)|
| 1:51:55| which I also love very deeply, having given 31 years of my life to Knox County and this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| But if it is not the will of this body that I serve in that capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| then I don't think you could go wrong in any of the directions you might go in these three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Thank you, Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| We'll do – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| Mr. Jay, you just go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| If it pleases the Chair, could I pose a question to all three candidates at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| I think, again, rotating the order, that would start with – that would go Longmire, Beeler, Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| Longmire, Sanders, Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Longmire, Sanders, Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| And I might ask, give you one minute to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| I have a question for all three candidates, so listen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| Could you speak to your experience in private enterprise and business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| and explain a little bit about your philosophy on the role of private enterprise business and government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| and how they might work together or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Well, being a teacher, one always works with business, trying to raise funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| and with the Gibbs Foundation, we're working with business, trying to raise funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| to provide things that the county cannot provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Also, my husband and his brother have had a grocery store since birth, practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| They were actually both born at the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| So I'm very aware of that aspect, what it means to have a business in Knox County, the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| and also what Knox County needs to do to support business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| Also, on MPC, very often we had a commercial project come before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| so looking how that project could support a neighborhood, could offer employment opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| and could provide Knox County with tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| So I feel like I'm fairly conversant with private business and the opportunities thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6838)|
| 1:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| Next, Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| Well, same question, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| You know, I've worked in all three, or not all three, but I've worked in three different, I guess, mediums, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6860)|
| 1:54:29| For the first two years of my employment life, I worked in a manufacturing plant called King Business Forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| It was over off Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| I watched a man named Jim King build that business up from the basement of his home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| and how hard he worked and how successful that company became.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Then I worked, obviously, for Knox County, and now I work in the nonprofit sector, I suppose, in a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6884)|
| 1:54:53| These relationships, they're the fabric of everything we do, economically and culturally, in terms of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| There has to be partnership between private enterprise, government, and nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| One of the things that I spoke about briefly was the need for government to partner with both of these sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| For instance, I spoke to the addiction epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| I think state-sponsored things are helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| and I think there are things that the government can do, state, federal level, in terms of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| I think if we're going to really tackle the problem, we've got to partner with the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6929)|
| 1:55:36| with the nonprofit sector, privately run recovery places that can help us understand the addiction problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6936)|
| 1:55:45| and how to solve it, how to teach people to live apart from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| So that partnership, I mean, it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| It's absolutely necessary, private industry, nonprofits, community, government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| It's all got to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| All right, Ms. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| Being a teacher, Ms. Longmeyer and I, we echo the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| At Carter Elementary School, we're always dealing with private businesses to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| and help us reach our endeavors and reach our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| One thing that nobody did mention was volunteerism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| There's a lot to be said about people such as Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| and the Baker Creek program that was going on that we were involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| There's a lot to say for people who will volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| You can get a lot done with people who have the knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| that will come and volunteer to do the project or do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| So I think, as I said, hand-in-hand, businesses and nonprofits and the business hand-in-hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7013)|
| 1:57:02| I think you have to use all that, but I think your resources are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| I think when you know somebody can do something for you, you use your volunteerism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| and that can get a lot of things done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| All right, Madam Clerk, we're going to have one more vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7039)|
| 1:57:27| Do you need to start with Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Okay, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7049)|

| 1:58:32| Commissioner Jay votes for Rebecca Longmeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7119)|
| 1:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| No one wishes to change their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| The total is Baylor 5, Sanders 3, Longmeyer 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| So that will drop Ms. Longmeyer off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| And we will have another vote between Ms. Sanders and Mr. Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181205CandidateHearing?start=7155)|
