| 0:00:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| I have two or three announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| We're going to continue to try to save trees, so if everybody doesn't have all their stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| together tonight, we'll send the packets over to Miss Day and Miss Dyer, and they can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| aplicants when I call the name of the company that's applying, you need to come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| podium in the center of the floor, you need to say your name and your address very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| After we go through and we approve your permit because you've got everything in, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| pick it up at the end of the beer board meeting from Ms. Day and Ms. Dyer over at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| over there. If you don't have everything in and it's pending, final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| then when you get all that done, you can pick it up from the tax office. And one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| this is the first meeting when virtually all the applicants have been required to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| a server compliance plan submitted. And when the packets first came to us, they were missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| a lot of those. We've picked up some today and I've gone through to try to identify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| ones we have. So, when they come up, if this is in your district, if you would ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| person, the applicant, how are you going to be sure that everybody is in compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| the ID laws and so on. George? So, we're going to let that be part of the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Well, that's the next question. You read my mind. Very good. And this is the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| that I think we need to decide. We have determined as a beer board that we want them to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| a plan for how they're going to be compliant in checking IDs. Where do we want this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| be? Can this be one of the things that's subject to final documentation? Is it something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| that needs to postpone their getting their permit? I need to hear from the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| as a whole. Councilman de la Vope? Thank you. Well, I think since it's the first day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| we're going to ask them questions orally, I don't think we should postpone their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| They wouldn't have had any advance notice after this. I think if they don't have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| information in front of us, I think we should say we're not in a position to really evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| their request. So, I don't have a problem with forcing them to postpone later, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| think it'd be unfair tonight. It'd be like springing on them at the last minute. Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Other thoughts? I agree. Councilman Starr, I think you're going to have a thought. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| can see it. I mean, I just, well, I guess one question is are we going to use some discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| on these plans? Because most of the items in this list, we don't have any, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| use any discretion. Right, and that's the question that we have on this one. Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| going to be one of those that has to be checked? Do we need to add it to the, so that it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| to be checked off? Do we need to postpone pending final documentation? In which case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| if they take it to the tax office, are they going to, well, somebody turns something in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| and that's okay. I mean, I need some thoughts of the veer board. And do you want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| a decision next veer board meeting? Yeah, I think we look at it and see how it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| and, you know, I agree with Marshall. I think if we're going to show discretion on it, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| we're going to analyze it and look at it and go, no, that's not good enough, or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| but I think, but I don't know. I think we're going to have to see how they go and see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| they're written and then I can tell you more. Okay. And are we going to provide a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| plan? And if so, then people just copy and paste that? Is that? Well, perhaps we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| have some questions that their plan needs to answer. Right. I saw that some really answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| questions that were submitted and others were sketchy at best. So maybe we need to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=293)|
| 0:05:02| what we want to have them including in the plan. Do they want, do we need to know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| they're going to use scanners? Are they just going to look at the ID and see if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| right birth date is there? I mean, you know. Can we hear from a hip shot from our legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| counsel who hadn't had time to look at this, but you might have something about, Marshall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| question was, are we really in a business where we don't have that kind of discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| We have bases to touch, but. Well, I'll get back to that, but before I forget, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| think that having the beer board having a form server compliance plan might be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| idea because someone might be able to, for a few reasons, someone might be able to creatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| come up with something they want to do above and beyond what's in the plan. There might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| be a new technology out there that we don't know about and they might think, well, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| I have to do is what here is in front of me. And also, hopefully it wouldn't come to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| but if someone, you know, if some plan was adopted by the beer board and that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| just simply had to adopt it, if there was some over-serving situation or underage serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| situation, there's no reason to pull the members of the beer board into the situation and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| guess in a stretch it could be some sort of, you know, liability by some creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| attorney out there. Councilman Starr, what was your point? So, do you think it's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| so we are going to use discretion in these plans? Well, it's got to be applied fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| whatever the policy is going to be. Now, in many circumstances things are passed pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| final documentation because the applicant is waiting on, for example, the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| to come out or building inspections to come out and that's, in some regards, that's outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| of their control. A plan for server compliance is certainly within the applicant's control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=427)|
| 0:07:16| but that's a policy decision for the beer board to make. May I suggest that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| think about this and present some feedback to Mr. Frost or Mr. Johnson about where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| want to go, where we don't want to go, if we don't want to go, and then we'll look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| it at our next beer board meeting. Okay. All right, the first business tonight is the Clarion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| Inn, and Mr. Tindall is with us once again. Chairman, Chad Tindall, 6804 Pembrokeshire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909. I'm here again, have all the documentation according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| to my conversations with both the city and the Knoxville Police Department, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| pending final documentation, the inspections that are ordinary, I think we have all our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| documentation in. Okay. Move to approve. Wait a minute, we're not done. Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| And I will extend an apology. Mr. Patel was traveling from out of town. He was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| at the last meeting, and I do extend an apology. He was traveling from out of town and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| believe he could be here, but he simply got delayed. Okay. Sergeant Coward. No applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| record. Okay, Ms. Dyer. We need a copy of the sales tax registration and inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| approvals from building inspection and fire prevention. Okay. All right. When do we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| that these will all be done by the next beer board meeting? Certainly. Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| So, do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending final documentation. Second. All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| favor? Wait, wait, before we vote, can we ask, do they have a proposed plan? No, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| don't, but they didn't apply, they submitted their application before that was a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| All right, well that's fine. So, erase that thought. Thank you. I was concerned when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| heard the comments. No, no. If you were before May the 1st, you're okay. If you were May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| the 1st or later, then you're in line. All right, thank you. Dollar General, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| to vote on that. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, now, the Dollar General on Pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| Ridge Road, and I'll bet this is Mr. Mitchell. Yes, ma'am, James Mitchell. Business or home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| address? Either one. 5405 Pleasant Ridge, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. Okay, Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| Howard. No record. Ms. Dyer. We need a building inspection approval. They did come yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| it just hasn't gotten to the office yet. Okay, thank you, and since this is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| I'll move to approve pending final documentation. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| Okay, is this kind of a typical Dollar General store? Correct, yes, ma'am. Okay, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=592)|

| 0:10:23| Howard. No record. Ms. Dyer. The file is complete. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| All those in favor? Aye. Now, tell us about your event. It is a 5K, 10K road race in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=630)|

| 0:25:32| Jeff Duke with Sorrentino's, 9507 Kingston Pike, 37922. All right, tell me where you are and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| you're going to open. We had our health inspection Friday, we had our fire inspection today, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| CO building inspection should be Monday. Okay. Hopefully, if not this week. All right, so when do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| you really want to be able to start serving food and beer? July 1st. Okay. So, we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| everything done within the next, within the next week. All right, so you, do you want us to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| 30-day just in case? Yes, ma'am, that, that, I think that'll be more than sufficient, more than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| need, I hope. Okay, all right. Move to postpone for 30 days. Okay, is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| Favor. Aye. Councilman Della Vopi, I'm sorry I overlooked your light. That's okay. I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| to ask this gentleman, is this like Govino's moved further west, or is this a different menu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| What are we talking? A little bit more extensive menu. It'll be, we'll have a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| quite a bit more Italian fare. The pizza side is going to be much less as far as that's concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| as far as a pizzeria type of thing. So, heading more into finer Italian food, if you will. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| right, all right. So, I'll be there. Thank you, we'll be looking for you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Have a good day. Council, we now have the Beer Board Hearing Officer application. Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| would you like to talk about that? Thank you. Back in the administration of Mayor Ash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| they established a hearing officer process to hear situations where, you know, underage serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1619)|
| 0:27:10| or overage, underage serving and over serving, as well as different type of beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| ordinance infractions. There was established a panel of five attorneys to hear it. Because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1636)|
| 0:27:26| some folks passing away or retiring, we are down to two attorneys. So, the ordinance calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1646)|
| 0:27:37| for Mr. Johnson to prepare an application, which I looked over and the City Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1657)|
| 0:27:46| Civil Service Attorney looked over as well. And this application will need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| form will need to be approved by the Beer Board. Once that's done, I'll ask the Knoxville Bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| Association to send out that information. They have a weekly email to alert members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| Knoxville Bar as to this. At the next City Council meeting, I'll have two things, a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1688)|
| 0:28:20| and an ordinance. The ordinance will be to amend the current ordinance, which calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| the City Council to look at the rate of pay for this on an annual basis. I had a good conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1707)|
| 0:28:36| with Celeste Herbert, who has been acting as a hearing officer for almost 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| under this process. And it's probably unnecessary to review the rate of pay for this on an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1725)|
| 0:28:57| basis. So, I talked about it with the Chair and we're going to propose that it's brought up on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| every two years, biennial basis. Then also, in talking with Ms. Herbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1744)|
| 0:29:13| going to suggest a rate of pay of a flat $225 per complaint. Most complaints are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1753)|
| 0:29:26| addressed by agreement or the permit holder does not show up. As in the case of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| businesses that they go out of business, they forget to turn in their beer permit. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| you get in trouble for that. So, the process starts to revoke the beer permit and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| show up. Now, on very rare occasion, do you actually have a matter go to hearing? It has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| probably been 8, 9 or possibly even 10 years before the last matter actually went to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| full-blown hearing. For that, we're going to make a suggestion of an hourly rate for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| rare occasion. But for about 99% of the hearings, because they don't go to hearing, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| suggest a flat fee of $225 for a complaint. Can I ask a question? Sure. When a complaint comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1818)|
| 0:30:33| do they sit down with the legal department and come up with an agreement? What does the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| officer have to do in that situation? It sounds like he's on a mailing list. Well, Mr. Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| can jump in here too. I should say the current rate is $150 per hour. So, I'll let Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1843)|
| 0:30:54| because he's the clerk here. We schedule a pre-hearing conference. With every case? With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| every case. We have to. So, the judge sits there or the hearing officer sits there and hears both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| sides? Correct. Right. And if the parties have reached an agreement prior to the date of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| hearing, or they may reach an agreement at the hearing itself, or subsequent to, we can avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| scheduling a full hearing if the parties can reach an agreement. And the hearing officer will sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| off on the agreement. Okay. So, he is active in that process. I thought they were just complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| filing and going through the system automatically. Mr. Frost can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| it avoids these matters having to be heard by the full beer board. That's the purpose of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| hearing officer. Okay. You want to correct him or not? I went to one of the hearings because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| thought I needed to know what was going on. And it's, most of the time, there's an agreement before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| the actual hearing occurs. I mean, when the evidence is pretty strong, you need to admit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| take your fine, and go home. And typically, that's what does occur. I also think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| is a real good system, rather than having the full beer board hear some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| because we, right now, have two attorneys on the beer board, but the next beer board might not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| any attorneys, and sometimes this gets a little complicated. Mr. Stare. Thank you. I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| one question was, why the change from the hourly rate to the flat fee? And who pays, does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| city? The fines. The city pays the hearing officers directly, and the city seeks to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| reimbursed by the permittees. Not in all cases is that possible, especially in cases where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| establishment is closed, and we have no way of contacting them. They've given us an address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| that's no longer good on their application, and we fail to make contact with them. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| we have to pay that cost. But there are some people who, I mean, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| Bravo had a pretty large fine that went into the beer fund account? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1976)|
| 0:33:05| That sounds pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Well, I guess you asked about how it arrived at a flat $225 an hour. Why the change? Is it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=1988)|
| 0:33:20| allocate it more simply to each case, or to save money? I think to more streamline the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| You know, the process has been going along pretty well for, you know, a couple decades now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| pretty much. And, you know, we're getting ready to open it up to three new individuals after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2015)|
| 0:33:44| applications have been screened. And I guess we wanted to be frugal. We don't want to give some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2024)|
| 0:33:53| applicant the false impression that this is going to be a large-paying job that's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| hours upon hours. So, we wanted to give potential applicants, I guess, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2039)|
| 0:34:09| fair notice of what would be involved in the remuneration that they would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| I guess, do we think the remuneration will increase, changing it to a flat fee, or decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| I would say it would increase it on the net. But for cases that take more time than the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| case, that doesn't take much time at all, it would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Because now it's $150 per hour, and I guess you can do a number in one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Well, the attorney's got to get the file in, they've got to run a conflicts check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| they've got to open the file, they've got to review all the pleadings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| The rate that is paid for civil service hearing officers, I'm told, is $200 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| So, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| All right, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| All right, there being no other business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170620?start=2102)|
