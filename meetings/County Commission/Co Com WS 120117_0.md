| 0:01:17| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| One thing I would like to do is to ask that item number 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| about the Citizens Academy that we defer that for another 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| days to the February agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| I just have not had an opportunity to meet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| and I hope to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| So if we could defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Name and address of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=95)|

| 0:01:37| 400 Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| The sheriff's office would like to add the flavor rich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| So added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=108)|

| 0:01:50| Name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| item number 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| consideration for a determination of a method of disposal for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| are recommending a competitive RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| And what we'd like to do is we'd like to take 30 days and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| written RFP for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| And so we're asking for a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| I had a question is because I've had a lot of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| as probably most of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| What we need to have is a discussion item about the Knoxville Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| and Tourism Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| If you'd like to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| I'd like to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| As a discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I was just going to mention that we were going to have them here as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| our guests for the chairman's luncheon next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| We may still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| there may still be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| I think we should at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| maybe if someone could give us an overview just on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| how their board's appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| how the chairman's elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| just the organization and what its relationship is with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| We'll add that on as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Is that a discussion item for today or for next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Did you want it today or did you want to wait until the chairman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| it may be worth us coming up with a few questions and then discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Well, maybe not as a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| but if someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| whether it's someone from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Mr. Troyer may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| just tell us a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| we may not have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Just give us some background so everyone is aware what the Knoxville Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| and Tourism Corporation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| their financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| just a background of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| no judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| no opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| but just some background of it because I know a lot of people are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| If we have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I think Gloria Ray needs to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| that's kind of what I was getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| For us to have that discussion today would probably not be appropriate at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| You can do it for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| So if we could set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| We'll do that on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| I am going to be extending an invitation to her to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| and she is coming Monday for a chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| So we'll withdraw the discussion item for today and do that on Monday at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| It will be 1130 in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| And, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| that wasn't really my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| but also kind of in that same line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| for this Women's Basketball Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| I don't know what the executive branch's feeling is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| but I would like to get a lot more information before I even want to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| for an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| cost of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| how we're funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| and just one document with it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| we're getting kind of shotgun with this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| and it's coming fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| this is a pretty major asset that we'll be discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| So I don't know if we want to do that in between now and the 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| but before we go out for an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| we need to have a good understanding of what we're talking about and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| kind of facility that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| we'd be glad to provide that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| and that's why we thought that we're recommending a competitive RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And I think it's important how we ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| because how we ask the question is how we evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| And I think you'd want to read that before you are able to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| competitive for 2012 for a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| a 40-year facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| we're hopefully at the bottom of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| even in a competitive nature in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| we may not get what the true value over that 40-year lifetime of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| facility that we built and invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| We may not recoup those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| So what I want to do is get kind of an apples-to-apples understanding on where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| we were when we built the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| what we've done in terms of payoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| and then where we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| maybe make an informed decision whether we go RFP or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| And also with the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| money is one aspect of the evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| but only a piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| And we need to talk about highest and best use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| and who would be an appropriate caretaker of that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| And I think that needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=377)|

| 0:06:19| I don't want to discuss that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| We're just going to wait until Monday at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=385)|

| 0:06:28| questions and give us some figures on who's got what bonus money over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| and be there just to sort of answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| For the chairman's lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=396)|

| 0:06:38| in our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| We'll put together some information and try to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| And is Frances still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Is she still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Frances is still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| If she could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Reports of her death are exaggerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Just getting back to the Knoxville Tourism and Sports and the Basketball Hall of Fame situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| I know we're not discussing it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| but I'd just like to make this comment that there's an awful lot of erroneous information out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| that needs to be clarified before anything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| just a clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Ms. Ray will be coming to the chairman's lunch on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| We do that at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| the Chamber of Commerce is asked to do a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| or I've asked them to do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| And so we'll have both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| That will be our agenda for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| So we'll have plenty of time to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Anything else that needs to be added or deleted or deferred from the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| If not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| do I hear a motion that all those things be added, added, deferred, deferred and withdrawn, withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=456)|

| 0:07:38| Let's go to the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| the approval of the minutes to the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Do we have a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I do have a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=474)|

| 0:08:07| eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Would anyone like to withdraw any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| If not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| do I hear a motion that those items be placed on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=500)|

| 0:08:28| item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| It's resolution 110,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| approving appointments to the Knox County Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Do any of you have anyone that you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| I would sense that we're probably going to want to send this on without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| but does anyone have any names that they want to make public at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| or wait until Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=527)|

| 0:09:06| Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| or ask him to send us one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I had Bob Roundtree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| used to be a county commissioner during some of that appointment time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| and I think everybody knows him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| and Jolie should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=554)|

| 0:09:17| you should have his number for Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| If you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| I've got a phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| I do not have a resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| but I think everybody knows him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| If you could ask him just to forward us just a bio for those that may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| be familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=565)|

| 0:09:29| Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Who's he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| Just out of abundance of precaution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| if you could ask him to send us a little paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| So for those of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=578)|

| 0:09:40| No appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| I assume Jeff will have an appointment from the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And I noticed in the paper you weren't serving because you're at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| I'm at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| but I'm serving as from the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Am I correct structurally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=591)|

| 0:10:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I think I mentioned this last month, but I just wanted to tell you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| that is a house that the students from South Doyle built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| And it's a gem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| These people are getting a real bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| So they do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| The next item is 14, resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| It's approving the Knox County Commission's 2012 meeting schedule as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| We are in need of having an organizational meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| and at the calendar we approved we had August the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Our charter, however, says it cannot occur until September 1st or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| So, therefore, we want to make sure that we're doing everything proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| because that is the Labor Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Joe Lee, the date we have submitted for recommendation is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| I believe it's September the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| It's the Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Monday, of course, is Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| So this would be Tuesday the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| So the other option would be to either try to meet over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| or meet on Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| So we just suggested Tuesday morning the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| So is there a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| All say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Item 16, ordinance 0-12-1-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| It's amending Articles 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| regarding the regulation of signs, billboards, electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| and other advertising structures in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| This amends Ordinance No. 0-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| I had a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| There's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| I was going to ask, could I move to send on without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| and then we discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Is there a second that we move it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| You know, I have just a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Is that, as you know, and we've talked about this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| where we've talked about making the sign ordinance permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| is that there's still ongoing litigation on a similar problem to this with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| And I believe that in our previous discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| we felt that we needed to get some sort of court guidance on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| or a court ruling before we made anything into an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| since it may apply to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| And my only question is, do we need to act on this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| or should we wait until we get some sort of court ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Mr. Jarrett, do you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Well, the only, Commissioners, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| The issue there, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| if you have pending litigation that could affect the outcome of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| that we're going to create that mimics that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| depending on what that court rules, your efforts could be rendered a nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| It just really depends on what the court will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| I've been having difficulty getting a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| as to when we'll get closure on that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| There's a lot of litigation across the state on these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| But the only risk you run is that you do pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| The court ultimately rules that the language contained is basically illegal or unconstitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| and it nullifies your ordinance or its effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| I mean, I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| I didn't have a chance to talk to anyone from the MPC, but we have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| I think a lot of this emanates from we've been rolling over every six months the moratorium that we've had on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| That's been going on for a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| And I guess it was a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Maybe you could shed some light on that from the MPC that we get some sort of closure on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| rather than just carrying it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| But I do know there's that litigation that involves the city and Lamar advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Buzz Johnson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Just to clarify what we have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and it may get to Dr. Briggs' question, is the fact that what was presented at the MPC meeting by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| the recommendation by staff was twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| The first part of that recommendation was to expand the prohibition of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| and other advertising signs to all zoning districts in accordance with amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| and that's shown in Exhibit C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And then the second part of that recommendation was to create regulations for electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=946)|
| 0:15:56| that doesn't quite go as far as the cities, but it does kind of serve as an intermediate step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=956)|
| 0:16:06| maybe as a period of transition to see how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| But we did include what could be a future recommendation that does mimic the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| in prohibiting future EMCs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| So I don't know if that gets at your question, but that's the nature of the recommendation from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| is to expand the prohibition of billboards to all zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| And number two, include some definitions and requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| and regulations for new EMCs as well as existing EMCs in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1002)|
| 0:16:50| You know, just as a reminder or disclosure, I think a lot of people know how I feel about the billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| because that was really my original proposal on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| and I think I even brought it up about making it permanent the last time that we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| But, you know, I do have concerns because it's something that we as a body have to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| do we want to do this until we do get clarification from the courts on the cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| It's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| It's not quite as comprehensive as this is, the litigation, but do we want to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| or do we want to go ahead and do this and then try to, if there is an adverse court ruling on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| then try to undo things and fix things from where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| That's just the question I think we have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| I don't necessarily know the answer, but that came up before when we had this same ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| that I proposed bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Well, as you can imagine, ever since the commission suggested this, I've been researching this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Most recently, the city of Brentwood, Tennessee, litigated their sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| It went all the way up to the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| Now, the court did rule in favor of the city of Brentwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| but again was very narrow in its restrictions as to how far an entity will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| and left a lot of issues unsettled, and that's the problem you have, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| But one of the things the court wanted to be definitive about is that the public entity shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| that aesthetic integrity is a priority in the community and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| My point is that case didn't give us a lot of guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| It did support, however, or I should say validate the city of Brentwood's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| which is slightly different than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| That's where you are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| We have two people who have signed up to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and the motion on the floor is to send on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| That was going to be my question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| I know that we've moved to send it on, but if any of those that are here today cannot be here on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| I think we should hear them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| We have Dan Ammons who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| If you'd like to speak to us now, you're welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| If you would give us your name and address for the record, sir, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I'm actually Russell Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I'm speaking in place of my brother, Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Russell Ammons, 7920 Ewing Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| I'm actually president of Outdoor Displays, which is a local billboard company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| In 1997, I started my business here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County, 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| When we started billboards in 1997, the county already had stringent billboard policies or practices in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1172)|
| 0:19:42| Right now we have to meet state requirements, county requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| and if there's a municipality, we have to meet municipal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| So you have restrictions on size, width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| You have restrictions on the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| You have restrictions on the proximity to another billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| You have restrictions on commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| It needs to be in a commercial zoning or the zonings that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| My opposition, and I'm here in opposition, is the fact of it's been regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| It's regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| And I'm just going to see what we have left in place so as the county grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| and as business districts grow, as commercial areas grow, new signs can be put up to meet the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| This is my livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| It's the livelihoods of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| We've got people that I've got people that have been billboard that have advertised with me for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| And they see it as a viable means to increase their economic income on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| I've also got, which I'll hand you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| This is from Bill Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| The county started regulating billboards in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| Up until the year 2008, there was approximately 126 billboards permitted as of 5-26-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1253)|
| 0:21:03| Now these, when he says billboards, these are faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Some billboards will have a face on one side and one on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| So there has only been 126 billboards in that length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| And then I've also got another document from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| And I'll pass these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| And it says, Dear Sir, I've recently reviewed our monthly reports of billboards removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| and canceled by sign owners in Region 1, which is this area, since January 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| And approximately 40 of those have been taken down in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Please let me know if you have any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| What I'm saying is our industry is regulated heavily right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| There's not been a whole lot of billboards put up recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| In the last two years, there haven't been any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| But prior to that, you know, roughly 2008, there was five faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| 2006, eight faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| We've got 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Actually, there's probably about 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| There's 86 in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| The 40 signs have been taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| It's probably been due to the fact that economic times in the sense of landowners are getting more educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| They're wanting higher percentages of our billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| So it doesn't make economic sense for us to leave them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| So some of them are having to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| You know, the commercial climate changes in an area, and the revenues aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| So, you know, the demand for the billboards aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| So we take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| So basically it's self-regulated in itself with, you know, with what the regulations that the county has right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| So it's not like, you know, there's 47 billboards that were built last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| And the year before that, you know, 27 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| But, you know, I oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| It's my livelihood, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| We are regulated by you guys, by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| It's been a good thing in the sense of, you know, you don't see billboards everywhere because they are regulated by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| And they have been for the past 16 years, 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| So as I stand here as a business owner, which my signs bring in revenue that you guys tax, you know, we're part of an economic base here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1384)|
| 0:23:15| And you're basically just, you know, choking me off to where there's not going to be any additional growth period whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| We are regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We are highly regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| And that's all we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| We don't need to shut them all the way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Let me pass these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Did we have one other person who wanted to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| Yes, sir, if you want to come to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Ma'am, we'll give you an opportunity to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Sir, if you would give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And, Mr. Chairman, before we move on to another individual, for the purpose of disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| I believe I know this young man from he is a member of and exercises at the same health club where I exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| He has never approached me about this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I just want to make sure people know I have been in the same waiting room, exercise room that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| Yes, sir, if you would give us your name and address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| My name is David Jernigan, and I'm at 1812 Regents Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| I am the Vice President and General Manager of Lamar Outdoor Advertising here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| I'm a resident of Knox County, and my livelihood also depends on this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| I have also 35 other families that are employed with our company that their livelihood depends on this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1469)|
| 0:24:39| The moratorium that has happened over the past two years or so, I understand that it has been under review for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| My hope is that you realize that we're in a situation of economic downturn, which I'm sure you're aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1488)|
| 0:24:58| but this is not, in my opinion, the time or the place to be stopping economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1498)|
| 0:25:08| And I speak on behalf of several businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| It's important to note that I just found out about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Who has a large share of billboards in Knox County, I just found out about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I do realize that they advertise this very small ad in the Knox News Sentinel, but it would seem to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| and I've read from the minutes of MPC, that a group that is for this being passed has been very, very involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1530)|
| 0:25:43| And it would seem to me that the companies that it affects and the advertisers it affects would be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| And to my knowledge, none of those were notified, including ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| And so that really, really concerns me that I get an email last week to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| hey, did you realize that your industry is about to be, you know, the kaposh be put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| And very frustrated, and so I wanted to be clear that we want to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| We are trying to do the right things, always, aesthetically, very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| I live and work in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I'm proud of what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| And we provide a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| There are hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses that rely on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| And I do have a handout that I'll pass along that shows the advertisers here in Knox County that bring tax revenue directly to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1590)|
| 0:26:41| Obviously, if their cash register is ringing by bringing people in off the streets, that allows them to grow and provide more jobs for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1601)|
| 0:26:52| And we need the opportunity to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| With what has happened recently, you know, there is strict, strict guidelines in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| There are very strict guidelines currently prior to the moratorium in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| I appreciate Mr. Ammons sharing those numbers because those are critical to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| And quite frankly, because of landowner scenarios and development and whatnot, I have taken down several billboards over the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1634)|
| 0:27:25| That's just what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| But as he mentioned, as the county grows, as new area grows and new development, we want the opportunity to grow with it and to be able to provide public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| Also, as part of this handout that you will receive, it's not only a list of advertisers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| but it's a list of public service that we do for the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Last year and the past four years, we've given over $1 million of advertising space to public service organizations that are right here in Knox County that do a tremendous amount of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1665)|
| 0:27:57| And if fewer and fewer billboards are out there, we're not going to have that opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| I can tell you they rely on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| When we have space available, we're happy to help those organizations do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And lastly, something that's very, very important is we, along with several other organizations, have formed alliances with several law enforcement groups, including the FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1690)|
| 0:28:22| Right here in Knoxville, from one of our billboards, if you're familiar with the granddad bandit that was robbing banks all throughout the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| a tip happened from one of our billboards that we donated in the alliance with the FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And he was tracked down from that billboard and is in jail now because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| You can go to the FBI's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| They've got story after story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We just ask that we want to be a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| We are absolutely opposed to these current amendments to the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| We feel like the current ordinance that was in place prior to the moratorium is absolutely sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| And I will pass these handouts to you guys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| But I appreciate it very much and would welcome any questions if now is the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| How many billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| And, Mr. Amos, I'd like for you to come back and be making your way back up to podium two and go over some of your figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| How many billboards are in Knox County, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Since we've taken down several in the past couple of years, there's a couple of hundred that's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| And some people get into the number of faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| That's number of structures and can be also interpreted as number of faces, but give or take a couple of hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| And just a rough estimate, what percent does your company own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I would say about 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Eighty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| See, I have a problem, Buzz, when this company hadn't been notified this was coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| In this openness that we're trying to do in Knox County government, we should have told the other company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| I'm trying to decide how I want to vote on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| But it bothers me that your company and the others were not even notified to give a fair chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| So I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Mr. Adams, can you go over those numbers real quick, what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Because I was trying to do the math and follow the math, but where we were with these billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| I passed out all my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| But on that sheet you can see Bill Pierce, who is the plans examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| If you go to get a or I go to get a permit, you have to get it permitted to Bill Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| And he is the plans examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Well, in May 2010, he wrote this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| He said that there are 126 billboards permitted as of 5-2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| That is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| As Mr. Jernigan said, I'm not sure if that's faces, if that's structures, or what that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| But those are permitted signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| So you take a billboard that's got one pole, but it's like a V shape, and it's got two on top, two on the bottom, so there's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| Does that count as one billboard or does that count as four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| How does the numbers go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| It just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Because there was really, you know, back to a certain date, you could actually have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| You could have two billboards on top of each other on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| You can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| But with the state, if that was the case, then each side, if you got a billboard that's a V like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| then each side would be permitted for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So that would be two permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Even though it's on one structure, it would be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Now, I'm not for sure about the clarity of this, how Mr. Pierce has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| But so I can't tell you, you know, if there's 300 faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. Jernigan has an idea of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I don't have that many faces in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And to be honest with you, I don't know how many I have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| So, Mr. Jernigan, if a billboard goes down because of a new construct, can another one be put up somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Say if one comes out in halls and it goes down, can you put one in South Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| When did that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Because when I was serving on the MPC, and Mr. Brown, you may have served on the MPC at the same time I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and it was told to us, let's say just for easy math, we had 200 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| If one went down in halls and we went to 199, then they could put one in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| But we kept our number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We froze that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| So when did that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Until this moratorium, outdoor advertising was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| So it wasn't what you're calling or what I refer to as a cap and replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| In other words, putting a limit on the number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| But in Knox County, if the proper zoning was met, if the proper spacing was met, the sizes and so forth, you were allowed to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| whether you took one down or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And as Russ mentioned, there's been very few, even prior to the economic meltdown, that have been built during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| But to address the scenario of how many, it seems to me from these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| which would be logical is that the state permits them a certain way, and so you have to have a permit on each direction facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| Whereas it seems to me from these numbers and based on my internal numbers, it's the actual structure in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| It doesn't represent the number of faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So facing east, facing west, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| So that would be the number of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| It's the actual billboard itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| The billboard structure is what that would represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And, again, I apologize you were not notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| We're all trying to make educated decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You know, I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| If you all, especially you two, two of the largest vendors or businesses in Knox County hadn't been part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2021)|
| 0:33:52| and wanted to be part of the process, then we need to go back to the drawing board to include you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| So I'm definitely in favor of as much conversation as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| But as I told the gentleman earlier, you know, that probably was the same time that the gentleman who was apprehended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| the bank robber, there's an electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| And I'm solely talking about electronic billboards right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| That's my scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I drive past one daily going to and coming from work in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| It's right on the Knox County side in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And I've caught myself looking at that billboard as it changed, what's coming up next, what's the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| I was trying to get the detail out of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Effective for you, but I think extremely dangerous for a person leaving work with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| 7,000 of my closest friends at about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| And there is a history of accidents and incidents right there in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| So with that said, you guys should be part of the team, but the experts need to be part of this equation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| And I'll say without, you know, passing the law in 1985 and not continuing to tweak, you know, I don't own a 1985 vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| I just got rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| So, you know, that's an old vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| You know, you kind of tend to need to keep evaluating it just so to say that we don't need to be regulating anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| We're done with regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| And I'm not saying that's what you're saying, but I'm putting my own spin on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| It's a bit short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| So this process is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| It's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| It should be appreciated by you all as well because as technology goes and grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| not all things make for good outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| As, you know, cars change, as speed limits change, as traffic patterns change, we have to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| And us as a legislative body need to kind of stay with that and evolve that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| But, you know, I'll end with I 100% agree that you all need to be invited to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| Hopefully you all will be invited to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| I don't know what's going to happen on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| but I'm not in favor at this time of passing anything that's going to have huge teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| I think this is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Sounds like we have you all's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Sounds like today we got NPC's attention in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Hopefully you all will come out with a good product and something that we can all, if not reluctantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| we can all get behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| So, again, there's two sides to this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And if we weren't here to legislate, electronic billboards would probably be more than they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| I guess I can comfortably say that, that there would be more of them out there than there are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| And I'm not a fan of electronic billboards on thoroughfares where, you know, driving is the key point or component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| You know, if I get a glance at a McDonald's sign or Weigel sign, I'll see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| But to have detail, facial, I need to recognize this face, I need to read this number to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| and I'm driving 55 miles an hour or 45 miles an hour, I think can be dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| depends on where you locate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| And it's changing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Just a brief question on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| This sheet we're given by William Pierce, I assume that's Bill Pierce, from 1985 through 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| a total of 126 permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Now, you estimated a couple of hundred in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Of course, in theory, these were each were doubles decided, that would be 252.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| But how about ones permitted before 85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Couldn't that run the number on up substantially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Or everything had to be permitted 85 forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| I'm not familiar with what the permitting regulations were in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| And, again, I'm not sure of his specific numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I think we probably need to get clarification on Mr. Pierce's numbers to where those actually come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| and I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| But once you permit one, you don't have to have it permitted again and again, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| So I'm just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| As long as you stay within code and whatnot, that it's on record and is documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Permitted 84 and prior is still out there unless it was torn down or highway came through or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| So there's probably well in excess of 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I noticed, I remember my first or second meeting on commission about a little over three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| we voted on extending Dr. Briggs' six-month moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| And I didn't hear a lot of resistance from, and I know a lot of people in the industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I didn't hear a lot of resistance about can't do this and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| And I see 08, there were five, 09, none, 10, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| Is that because of the, I guess that's because of the moratorium and the economy also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| On our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Just moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| The moratorium is the reason that none have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I mean, I can honestly say that because of the economic climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| there were other things that had been focused on other than developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| It was fine-tuning our current business that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| And I'll just add editorially, I guess, a lot of the resistance seemed to be the electronic message system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| whatever it's called, at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I mean, that's why I supported your moratorium because a lot of people said that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| I know the one, and I look at it, it's about 197, I guess, crosses the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| I guess that's one of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| They're on both sides and they flip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| They have Gatlinburg advertisements and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| But anyway, I think that was a lot of the resistance initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Could I make a clarification to Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Mr. McKenzie, there has been additional regulations added since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| One of them has been height restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| They reduced the height restriction, size restriction, also the distance, the radial distance around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| So there has been additional regulations since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| I guess the point I was making is there will probably be more is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| But hopefully that won't be too intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| That will affect you all's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| We have one other person who has asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Commissioner Briggs, did you want to ask questions of these gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| We'll let her go ahead and speak and then I'll add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I didn't have any questions for them specifically, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Yes, ma'am, if you give us your name and address of the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| My address is 1540 Aguila Avenue in Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| And I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| I'm really disappointed to hear this discussion developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| First, I want to address the current litigation in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| It has nothing to do with the billboard ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Billboards were banned in the city in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| There's never been any litigation that has been brought because of the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| The litigation that is pending in the city between the city and Lamar Advertising has to do with the fact that Lamar surreptitiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2475)|
| 0:41:26| and without a permit converted two traditional billboards to digital format when digital billboards are explicitly illegal in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2486)|
| 0:41:39| They turned one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| The city got wind of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| The city placed an injunction against Lamar and told them to turn it off, and Lamar turned around and sued the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| It has absolutely nothing, nothing to do with the ban on billboards that has been in the city since 2001 and has been highly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2510)|
| 0:42:03| Banning billboards and electronic message centers is a growing trend across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| More and more communities are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Brentwood is just one example in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Billboards have been variously called litter on a stick, weapons of mass distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2536)|
| 0:42:27| Commissioner McKenzie, you're exactly right that digital billboards especially are highly distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| All billboards are distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| They're designed to be distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| If they're not distracting, then there's no reason for them to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| There is research to show that whenever a driver takes his eyes off the road for more than two seconds that the rate of accidents increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| It takes more than two seconds to read a digital billboard usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| And we also know from human factor research that there's a trend for humans to want to see the continuation of any process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2574)|
| 0:43:04| What happens is exactly what you've described is that you are driving along and you see the billboard face and you read it, but you know it's going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2584)|
| 0:43:13| and you want to see what it's going to change to, and so you continue to watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| There is a study that has just been recently concluded, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| It's been conducted by the Federal Highway Administration on whether digital billboards contribute to a higher frequency of accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2600)|
| 0:43:31| but the results have not yet been released, so I can't tell you what the results are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| As to the distractibility, on 640 there's a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| I'm not sure it's still there, but it has been there until recently, and it might still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| It isn't even a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| It's a billboard, and it's advertising a local body shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| and the billboard reads simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| if you're looking at this, we'll see you soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| So very clear that if you're looking and reading billboards that you're more likely to get into an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| I understand that this affects people's livelihoods, and I'm sorry that these folks didn't know about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| It's been pending and discussed for quite a while now, but billboards affect more than just the industry that puts them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| They affect every single resident and every single visitor to an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| They are ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| They are distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| They mar the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| People dislike them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| If you poll people, you find that about 90% or over 90% of people will tell you they hate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| They do nothing to add to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| The best way to promote economic vitality is to create an attractive community where people want to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| where people want to visit, where tourists want to go, where people want to develop businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| Also, in terms of promoting local businesses, I don't have statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| but if you drive around and look, you'll see that the majority of billboards are not advertising local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| They're advertising some kind of national company like Coca-Cola or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| They're not advertising local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| I hope that you'll pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| I think it's a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Personally, I don't even think it goes far enough, but I'd like to see we'd like to see a ban on electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| and we'd like to see language in the ordinance that's specific to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| This just talks about billboards, but it does not say anything about digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| and as I mentioned to you all a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| Ma'am, your time's about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| If you could wrap it up for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| There was a ruling in city court that we think gives the billboard companies permission to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| and convert from traditional to digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| so there needs to be explicit language in the ordinance preventing digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Just real quickly, just this is a definition of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| is that the digital billboards are the billboards that, you know, they can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| They're like looking at your TV screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| They're backlit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| That's what a digital billboard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| They can change those ever so often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| so there can be multiple companies that are advertising at one time on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| I think they use the term face, and I think that's the proper term for a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| The electronic message centers are those things that you might see outside of one of the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| where it has a message that's either scrolling across or scrolling down or it changes ever so often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| Most of the message, the EMCs, the electronic message centers that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| really are in violation because they're supposed to stay there so long so they're not a distraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| and I would agree with what Commissioner McKenzie was talking about it being a distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| I think those two things, the digital billboards and the EMCs, really concern me because they're changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| and I really do think that there's a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| There was another incident at an airport in one of our large cities that was scrolling down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| and trying to have the flights, and cars were running into the back of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| when people were looking up and trying to read these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| and I think they finally had to take it down because it was such a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| So I think we've got to be really, really careful, and absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| I don't think we should have any digital billboards, and I don't like the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| There should be no new ones, and we need to enforce the present regulations on the EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| because I think they're dangerous just like the digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| and I think there's some evidence to support that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| I want to make a couple of other comments, and this pertains more to the regular billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| and this is something that I've got to just sort of have a personal hang-up about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| and I've been counting these things because I watch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| When I drive home from work downtown, there's three billboards that's advertising adult entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and adult stores as I go home, and there's also a billboard that advertises one of the companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| that's basically one of the places around here that's basically a strip joint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| and I take my 11-year-old niece out to Farragut, who lives over in Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| and a lot of times we'll have to circle downtown for this, and she's asked me more than one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| you know, what is it, the adult entertainment place that she has to look forward to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| and isn't the Mouse's Ear a real cute little name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| And when we're talking about responsibility, I think some of the responsibility is on those billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| that the children shouldn't be asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| I have to admit, a lot of my opposition to it is my discomfort, but I don't think that looks good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| and I don't think that's a good reflection of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| From downtown to the county line, there's four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| And just one more thing on the aesthetics, and this is at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| As you're coming down I-75, some of that's a pretty remarkable view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| and you come around one of those corners, and right in front of you, in front of this big mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| are two or three billboards stacked on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| And I do have some aesthetic concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| Motion on the floor is to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Opposition? Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| He's in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| There was one opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Jeff Owen is opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| We're doing the resolution that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| It's approving a contract with Flavor Rich Dairies, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| The next item is number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| It's discussion of Knox County's comprehensive annual financial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| I had asked John Troyer if he would come and spend up to five minutes to just give us a thumbnail sketch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| of how we ended the year financially, because we are the funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| So, Mr. Troyer, you've already given us your name and address for the record, so you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| I certainly want to start with, you know, our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| It's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| And we certainly encourage people and your constituents also to take a look at it, ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| and we certainly will take appointments and sit down and talk to citizens, which we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| and go through the details and let people understand about their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Also on the website, we've got short and long versions of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| I think those, I hope they're helpful, and we certainly welcome comments about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And there's another report called the Budget Report to the Citizenry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and that's a little bit more detailed on budgets, revenues, and expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| And I think, for me, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| And so that's some of the reports that I use, and we hope they're helpful to you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| Without belaboring too much is that we did have a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| I would point to a couple of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Page 108, if you look at the general fund, the general fund had a net change in fund balance of a positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| and that's due to, one, revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| We were conservative on our revenue estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| and we need to give credit to the departments and the elected officials for holding the line on spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| And so as a result of both of those activities, we were able to put money back into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| which is always a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| Flipping ahead to page 110, you can look at the general fund fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| You know, maybe I'll write all this up and give it to you so you don't have to write anything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| General fund unassigned fund balance, and that's the one that I like to use as our most meaningful measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| of our resources available for the commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| Our unassigned fund balance had an increase from $42 to $43.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| I think that's a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| If you look at the next page, page 111, you'll also see our total expenditures for the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| And our number went up from $149.5 up to $151.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| But you'll also remember that there was an adjustment, a budget adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| for about $2.2 million for automobiles during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| And so if you take that one piece out, our spending went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| And I think that is really a measure of holding the line on spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| and so that helped make it possible to put a little bit of money back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| Let's move on further to 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| I do want to point out our constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| From the previous year, there was a $1.4 million reduction in their funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| For 2011, there was an increase of $229,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| and that was due to an increase of $400,000 on revenue and a decrease of $600,000 on spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| And so between those two, that certainly helped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Skipping ahead to schools, page 204 and 205 I think are real helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| We went from under-budget for revenue for the schools of 2010 to over-budget in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3212)|
| 0:53:43| and so I think that's a measure of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| The school department is more needy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| or the impact of sales tax is more prevalent in the school budget than in the general fund budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| and I think that sales tax helped them on the revenue side, property tax as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| And if you look on the next page, you can see that the school board had an increase in their fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| and that also had savings on their spending side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I would also like to note that if you look at page 231,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| and you can see just kind of a ten-year trend, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| property tax, sales tax, hotel-motel, business, will tax, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| And after a year of decline in 2010, we're back, and we had a small increase in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3263)|
| 0:54:33| and I think that's an indicator that we've seen the bottom of this recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| We're starting to come out, and so that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| It's just slowly, and we don't want to get too excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| but I think that's an optimistic note to start our budget process for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| Well, it was good news that we were able to put more money in our fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| that the schools were able to put more money in their fund balance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| So as we look at the budget next year, we're beginning on a positive note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| So it's good to hear you say that it looks like that perhaps the economy is beginning to turn around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| because we're seeing nice increases in our sales tax revenues over the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| We're certainly hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Any questions, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| I'm sorry, Mr. Chaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you, John, for sending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| I hadn't spent enough time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I was surprised, and after reading it, I saw why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| Bonded debt at 691.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Because the refunding and everybody else hasn't been paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| I hope I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| And the other piece to that is that we did some refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| We had some energy management leases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and so they changed the name of the debt from a lease to a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| But the total amount of indebtedness was similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| It's just that we wanted to take advantage of those lower interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| I know when you – with the PFM goal, when you was – what was the number, 3% to 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| When they came out with that thing last spring, they said nothing should be refunded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and we've since refunded, though, several, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Right, and thank you for that question because that gives me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| We have been through the ratings process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| and we should – we're hopeful to get a report here in the next two weeks about our – Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| They come take a look at Knox County, their finances, and their economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| And we're going to go to market one for just the capital plan money that's scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| and we're hoping to include that in some refunding numbers too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| So we're going to try to refund in the next two weeks and try to achieve some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| I did also want to report that what Commissioner Shouse alluded to is PFM's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| We have engaged PFM to give a similar report this year, and they've already started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| and they're going to be on site tomorrow to do some background work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| And we certainly would, you know, welcome your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| and we hope that in the end they will make another report like they did last year to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| You – I'm looking at page 5 of the first financial section where the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| where I first saw the $691 million, two, three-line standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| Of that total, 62.6 – you issued $108,911,000 in new bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| Of that total, 62 was issued to refund existing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| So that would – am I correct in saying the 691 is inflated roughly by 60-plus million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| So it should be more like 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I mean, that's like me going out and making a – borrowing money to pay somebody off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| but it just hadn't hit the ballot sheet yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Right, because of the new money, there are two pieces of the new money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| the $17 million new money, which was for the – in accordance with the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| and then the $29 million of the stimulus state QSCAP money, which was for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| and that, in essence, put them ahead for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| which we would have borrowed in this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| We just happened to do it because it was such an attractive interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| It's – am I correct in saying that's basically a zero interest rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| We have to pay some small fees, but basically a zero interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| And the $46 million was billed to Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| So, at the back pages, it still runs our per capita up higher than it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| I mean, I'm sure you're aware of that more than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| It runs it up to 1564, which is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Right, and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| The agencies know that, I hope, when we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| The agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| we'll get their written report here in the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| With our verbal discussions, they were certainly comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| and they understood those transactions, and we went over those in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| And that will – when will that roll off of our ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| When will we get back to the 630 that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| Well, you'll see the numbers, and you'll see the numbers in the new year will come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| And so we – in essence, there was a pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| and we had to get through the pipeline of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| And now that we've done that, now we can come back down on the downside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Because the mayor's goal, I think I'm correct in stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| is to basically mature more debt than sell debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| More mature than we go to the bond market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| By $100 million over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And so he absolutely wants to stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| So that's still our goal, and that's an admirable goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you so much, Mr. Troy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Item number 18 is discussion with Tim Howell regarding the Senior Citizens Home Assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| Mr. Howell had contacted me and asked if he could address commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| with regards to the Senior Citizens Home Assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| There was a pledge of some monies from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| and he has asked if he could come and address us with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Mr. Howell, if you could give us your address for the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| My name is Tim Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| My address is 6853 Fraker Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| And I'm just here to talk to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| and maybe keep in the forefront of your mind a commitment that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| to Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service regarding a $3 million pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| The agency is a 501C3 agency, and I know I've written you all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| and talked to you a little bit, so if I go into too much history here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| you can stop me and I'll jump forward a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| But we're an agency that typically serves people in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| We send caregivers into the homes of elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| and we are able to offer a sliding scale fee to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| so we can help them with bathing and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| and providing housekeeping services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| homemaker keeping their homes clean and so forth for those that can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| so it enables them to stay in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| And one of the things that we saw was that people were having to leave their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| and go into nursing homes, and Medicaid would end up paying for those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| because they didn't have affordable assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| And so they would go through the system and they would spend down all their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| and then they would end up in a nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| because there wasn't technically affordable assisted living out there for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| So we made it our goal and our mission to come up with affordable assisted living for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| And one of the first things that helped us to build that assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| was a pledge from then Mayor Mike Ragsdale on July 6, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| He had told us that if we were able to raise $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| then the county would match that with $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| so that we could move forward in getting the building built with the assisted living in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| And so we took that as a challenged grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| and he sent us a letter of intent saying that that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And then we moved forward with raising that match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| and also getting that building there and getting it built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| and it's just right down the road here from us at 206 Bearden Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| And any of you are welcome to come by and see it if you would like to and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| It is a great building, and it is doing exactly what we had intended for it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| Over 80% of the people that live in that building are under the 150% poverty level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| but because of help from their family members and maybe the VA and other things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| they are able to afford to stay in our assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| and to basically pay for their services and stay there instead of going into a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| And so we feel like as an agency that we have met that promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| and we have done what we have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| and we are still collecting on some pledges that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| but we did go over the $3 million that was challenged to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| And to this date, we have collected $2,443,410 from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| toward the $3 million letter of intent that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| and that leaves a balance of $556,590.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| And so we were not put in the budget last year to receive any funding on that balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| and so I wanted to come today and just kind of educate you as to where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| and hope to be considered to be put in the budget for this year as going and looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| I know I've heard you all talking about the budgets here and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| and getting ready to go into the 2013 budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I was hoping that you all would keep that in your mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and do something to help us out with getting this pledge paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| so that we can get our note paid off at the bank that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| And, again, I just want to stress that we feel like we did what we said we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| We've got people living in our building that need to stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| and they're not depending on Medicaid now so much to help pay for their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| They are able to pay their way, and their family members are able to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| We charge $2,500 a month, which if you go around and shop assisted livings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| and that is for all the services in that assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| So if you go around and charge, if you go around and just kind of price that assisted livings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| you will know that that is a great deal for people to have, and it allows them to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| And so I would be glad to answer any questions that you all have and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| But, again, just wanted to be in the forefront of your minds going into this budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| to see if we could get some funding or pledge payments on this amount that was promised to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Mr. Howell, you said that you all were going to raise $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| The county was going to give you $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| You said you were short of your side of the $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Have you all raised your $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| We have well exceeded that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| We went to about $5.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Oh, okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| I thought you said you were short on some pledges coming in, but you weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Some of those pledges are still being paid, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| If you're at $5.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| We've easily collected over $3 million at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Have you had a conversation with Mr. Troyer, our finance director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Several of my board members and myself went to visit Mayor Burchett, I guess, about two or three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| And at that point in time, he had stated that he would do everything he could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| looking into the budget for the new year to help us out and get that into his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| So that was the meeting that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I've not been to see Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I just want to make sure you make contact with the administration on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| because they're the ones who will be preparing the budget for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you, Tim, for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| This is something that I have been concerned about since last year's budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| Our senior population in Knox County is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| As the baby boomers age, this kind of facility is going to become more and more important to our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3938)|
| 1:05:48| And there is very good research that shows that keeping people in their homes as long as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| or into an assisted living facility rather than a nursing home provides a better quality of life for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3957)|
| 1:06:06| It also is less expensive for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| So this is a fabulous facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| They provide a much needed and very high demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| and will be even greater in demand service that saves us money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| So I hope that we'll all take a good hard look at this over the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| and do everything we can to make good on the promise that was made to this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| and help them stay providing the service that our seniors need and that will save us money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=3999)|
| 1:06:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Do you apply for these funds under the community grants process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| you go before the committees and you file the application, or how are the funds being requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| They've come from several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| It's my understanding that they have come from several different places in the county's budget, so I'm not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| We have done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Just earned some of these payments, came through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| And then there were other areas, I think, that it was put in the capital campaign budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| And, again, I'm not an expert on where these funds came from from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| but I can go back and give you records of the checks and so forth that we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Yeah, I guess what I was asking is that, you know, you said you didn't get any funds last year from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| but it was because when it went through the committee process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| they felt that you were less worthy than some of the others in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| That's just what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| We did not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| We applied for our homemaker service last year under that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| We did not apply under this for this campaign for these funds through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| And typically it did not come through that process, but we did receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| I think in 2011 it came from a defined service contract is where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And then there was one year in there where we, in the 2008-2009 payments, we got four payments of $83,352.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4090)|
| 1:08:20| All of those payments did come from that initial process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| I think that was the first year that they asked nonprofits to go through that phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| And so, yes, at that point in time we were rewarded somewhere around, if you add those three payments of $83,000 up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| or those four payments of $83,000 up, I think that comes up to about $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| So we did receive funding from that that year, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| And just to talk a little bit about Commissioner Broils and what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| I think when you look at the services that you supply to your elderly, it needs to be a rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| you need to have choices in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| And many of the things that we have out there before was around nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| and now we're seeing more adult daycares, more assisted living, more options to stay in your homes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| I think that is one of the things that is attractive to people when they do want to decide where to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| what types of services are out there for the elderly to ensure that they have a good retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| And so I think we're one of those great options for people that are middle class that have worked hard all their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| that want to pay for their way but need affordable services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| And so I think that is one thing about Knox County and East Tennessee with our agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| where we stand out from other agencies is that we are able to do that to serve that middle class population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| Tim, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I think you're headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| You've talked to the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| So we'll stay in touch as we go through these next few weeks and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Item number 19 is the presentation by the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| Commissioner Broils, do we have or is this for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| This is for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| Oh, this is also for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| The swearing in will take place on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Is there any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| What happened to the we postponed the hillside thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| I thought that was for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Well, yeah, that is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| I thought it was on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| Mr. Jarrett, can you describe why this is here rather than in zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| I have no knowledge as to how it's placed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| I do know that we just received a packet of information from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| and I'm reviewing that at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| But in terms of how it was placed on the agenda, it's not my call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| Wouldn't it be zonings coming from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Jolie, can you shed some light on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| We always put everything on the work session at the commission direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| Zonings didn't used to be on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| but then the commission requested that we start including zonings on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| I mean, if it's a pleasure of the commission, we can talk about it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| but that's why I just mentioned it was on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Well, I guess at the least I would probably like to have a bit of discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| I've had a number of meetings with sunshine meetings with commissioners, just as a briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| I won't make it laborious, I hope, if that's the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| Commissioner Burroughs, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Commissioner Norman, if you'd like to go ahead and address us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Of course, the first thing, you were given a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and I don't know whether you had a hard copy of this in the December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| but we had the amendment that we approved in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| and then the alternative amendment that was crafted by the NPC staff there is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| So we wanted to provide you with that so you could do some comparison between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| And I've been meeting, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| probably everybody noticed the advertised meetings that I've had with several of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| And in those, of course, what I'm trying to do is just get a reconsideration of that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4368)|
| 1:12:58| And so we're in that point, I guess, between now and Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| And I don't know where the discussions are in that exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| but we're hopeful the body of people that supported the task force and so on in our positions in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4388)|
| 1:13:18| are hopeful that some adjustments can be made in that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Some of you may be aware of the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| Of course, you probably are aware that NPC passed what we sent to them without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| And there was some interesting discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Some of you may have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Then, of course, city council then passed the version of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| which had the changes in it that we had adjusted during the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| So they passed that version on emergency session before the new city council came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| So that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And there may be some news before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I just wanted to make some comment because I was one of the people that Tony met with about, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| it was about ten days ago or so that we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| And just to try to elaborate some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| because I think that there's been a lot of misunderstanding about what the intentions were of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| that I proposed that was passed as part of the hilltops and slopes plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| What my intention was, because I can't speak for anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| is that I did not want to have a plan that was in place that would be looked at someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| or challenged in the courts that the courts would say that this plan is binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| that there would be no appeals before an elected body or before an appointed body, such as the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4496)|
| 1:15:05| because of some of the Tennessee code annotated because of some of the state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| And I believe that's where this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Yes, the plan that we have now does talk about an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| But if you look very carefully at the wording, and we're talking about words such as should and shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| and this is some of the argument that the, to be perfectly honest, that the chamber made on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| is that there would be a possibility that if a judge looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| that he would say that this plan is binding, it can't be appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| that the intention of the commission was that this be part of a process that ends right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| if you don't meet all the criteria for development according to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| And I think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| It's a double-edged sword when you have something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| I know everyone thinks that this in some way protects or gives an advantage to the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| but it also, if it were binding, would also tie the hands of a citizen's group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| who did not like certain things that were happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| And I'll give you two examples very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| As many of you all know, we recently had, at a very contentious meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| had a restaurant that was trying to build along the lakeside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Much of that was underwater below the TVA's flood level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| and they'd have to build it up just to get it above water enough to put the thing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| But it would have met just about every plan that someone has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| and it actually passed the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| It ended up coming back to us, and ultimately, as we listened to some of the citizens' opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| about how it would mar a really beautiful shore side of Lake Loudon or a branch off of Lake Loudon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4611)|
| 1:17:00| how if we did this, it would accelerate into having zoning changed along a long stretch of the lake right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| And ultimately, as the elected body, we decided that that should not go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| even though it met all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| In other words, we were able to protect the residents' and the citizens' interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| because we thought that that was not a good idea to have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| At least, finally, a majority of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| It was a very close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| I think it passed by one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Some of you may not be aware that we recently had a similar situation with the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| It was in the city, but I attended the NPC meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| and I attended the city council meetings on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| about a 60-some-odd-foot sign they were wanting to put up at that development there on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4659)|
| 1:17:49| really where they cleared off the top of a hilltop, and they put some stores and all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| But, I mean, this had passed everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| It really met every regulation and code, and there was nothing wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| but just the citizens felt that this was a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| and they really didn't want to have more large, very ugly, quite frankly, ugly signs along there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| in an otherwise attractive neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| And because we were able to appeal this, and this went back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| finally the city council was able to overturn this, even though it met every criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| because it was a bad idea there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| And so these things do protect citizens where things are not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| And what I would like to see with our hill slopes plan is to have a plan that serves as a guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| or really that says that if there's going to be deviation from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| is that a developer would have to come before the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| and defend why this plan should go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| even though it doesn't meet the slopes and hilltop guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| The NPC probably would be obligated, or the way I would like to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| is that they would be obligated to say, no, it doesn't meet the guidelines and we're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| What we'll do is that we'll refer this to the elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| and then we have to decide if this is good or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And it's the same way with the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| If a bad plan goes forward, even though it met the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| they would have the right to appeal that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| The thing is, we don't know what a judge is going to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| It does look like it's appealable the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| I'm going to stop here, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| I know I'm over my time, but just give me a second more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| But you really don't know what the courts are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| and if the courts read the letter of the law strictly on the Tennessee Code annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| there's a possibility that everyone's hands would be bound, and I don't think we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| What we're doing is that over the next week, Joe Jarrett's going to look at the wording on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| to be sure that we still have the essence of the plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| but we do make it very clear to the judge, and this is what my proposal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| is that this thing would have the right to be appealed to a body that's accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| such as the BZA, or to the county commission, where we would have to respond to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| Just as clarification, on the agenda Monday, this will be on our zoning, just to make sure that everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| So this will be heard at 6 o'clock on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Just want to make sure we're all clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Normally I have a public meeting on the Thursday between work session and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| and because this Thursday I will be attending city BZA with a group of constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| and we have the state of the school's address at 5.30, I'm going to be having that meeting at 3.30 on Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| and I just sent out a public notice to that effect, so I hope this coming Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| So I hope that some of you all can come and have some coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Any other items to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| If not, we stand adjourned until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws120117?start=4857)|
